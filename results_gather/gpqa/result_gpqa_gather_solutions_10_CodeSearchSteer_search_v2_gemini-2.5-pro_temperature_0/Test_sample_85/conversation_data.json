This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one carboxylic acid has been converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\n**Structure of the Starting Material:**\n```\n      O-iBu\n     //\nHO-C-CH2-CH-CH2-C\n  ||      |    ||\n  O       Et   O\n  C1 C2  C3 C4 C5\n```\nThis is the general structure for starting materials A and B. The chiral center is at carbon C3. The reactions involve reducing either the carboxylic acid group (at C1) or the ester group (at C5) to a primary alcohol, followed by intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Structure of the Product:**\nThe product is a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  C(2)=O  C(6)\n  |       |\n C(3)----C(4)--Et\n         |\n        C(5)\n```\nSince the reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3), the absolute three-dimensional configuration of the stereocenter is preserved throughout the reaction sequence. However, the R/S designation might change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents on the chiral center change.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate, which is unreactive towards the nucleophilic hydride.\n2.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material A: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    *   Intermediate (Hydroxy Acid): `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid)\n3.  **Lactonization:** The intermediate hydroxy acid cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved during this step. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy acid must have the (R) configuration.\n4.  **Analysis of CIP Priorities:** We need to determine if the R/S designation changes from the starting material A to the intermediate hydroxy acid.\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Starting Material A:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority: C→C→O(C))\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority: C→C→O(H))\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Intermediate Hydroxy Acid:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (Highest priority: C→C→O,O,O)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Second priority: C→C→O,H,H)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Conclusion on Priorities:** The group that was priority #2 in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes priority #1 in the intermediate. The group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced and becomes part of the new priority #2 group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). Because the relative priorities of the top two groups have swapped, the R/S designation is inverted, even though the absolute configuration is unchanged.\n    *   Therefore: (S)-Starting Material A → (R)-Intermediate → (R)-Lactone.\n5.  **Result for A:** To get the (R)-lactone as the final product, the starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n2.  **Reduction Step:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material B: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    *   Intermediate (Hydroxy Ester): `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` (isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate)\n3.  **Lactonization:** The intermediate hydroxy ester cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy ester must have the (S) configuration.\n4.  **Analysis of CIP Priorities:** We need to determine if the R/S designation changes from the starting material B to the intermediate hydroxy ester.\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Starting Material B:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Intermediate Hydroxy Ester:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Second priority)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Conclusion on Priorities:** The group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains priority #1. The group that was priority #2 (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced but the resulting group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) is still priority #2 (since it's higher priority than the ethyl group). The priority order of the substituents (1 > 2 > 3) does not change.\n    *   Therefore: The R/S designation is preserved. (S)-Starting Material B → (S)-Intermediate → (S)-Lactone.\n5.  **Result for B:** To get the (S)-lactone as the final product, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products**\n\n*   **Reaction A Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction B Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBoth products are δ-lactones (six-membered cyclic esters). They are enantiomers of each other. The chiral center is at position 4 of the lactone ring.\n\n### **2. Determine the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nA δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\nThe structure of the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, indicates that its open-chain precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n*   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)OH\n\nThe chiral center in this precursor is at C3. Upon cyclization, the C3 of the acid becomes the C4 of the lactone. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the chiral center is conserved during the lactonization step.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will cyclize to (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will cyclize to (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Starting Materials and the Transformation**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's analyze its structure:\n\n*   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu\n\nThis molecule has two carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-iBu) at C5. The chiral center is at C3.\n\nTo get the required precursor (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) from this starting material, a reduction must occur. Comparing the structures, the ester group at C5 must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the carboxylic acid group at C1 must remain unchanged.\n\n**Transformation:**\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu  →  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n\n### **4. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\n**Reaction A:**\n*   **Starting Material A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization of the resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the precursor must be (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which in turn must come from the (R)-starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n*   **Starting Material B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that is well-known for its high chemoselectivity, typically reducing carboxylic acids much faster than esters. However, for the reaction to yield the given product (a 4-ethyl-lactone), the ester group must be reduced, not the carboxylic acid. Reduction of the carboxylic acid would lead to a different product (a 3-ethyl-lactone), which is not observed.\n*   **Mechanism:** We must infer from the product that under the conditions of this specific reaction, the BH₃ reagent reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) leads to the lactone. While this reactivity is atypical for BH₃, we must assume it occurs to yield the stated product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction A, the chiral center is not affected by the reduction or cyclization. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the precursor must be (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which must come from the (S)-starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester). The only difference is the stereochemistry at carbon 4, which is the chiral center bearing the ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material Structure:** The proposed starting materials are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-C(=O)O-iBu) at the other. The chiral center is at carbon 3, which corresponds to carbon 4 in the final lactone product.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acid).\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally *not* strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The ester group in the starting material is reduced to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu --(LiBH₄)--> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n        3.  Upon addition of acid (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. So, A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acid).\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH₃ is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group in the starting material is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu --(BH₃)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n        3.  Upon addition of acid (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to reaction 1, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. So, B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n5.  **Final Match:**\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the reagents and their selectivity.\n# LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces esters to alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n# BH3 (Borane) selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols but is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1.\n# A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n# The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid monoester: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu.\n# LiBH4 reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 intact.\n# The intermediate is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH.\n# Acid workup (H+) causes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n# The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the product).\n# Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n# Since the product is (R), the starting material A must also be (R).\n# A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2.\n# B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n# The starting material B has the same structure type.\n# BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester at C5 intact.\n# The intermediate is a 5-hydroxy ester: HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu.\n# Acid workup (H+) causes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, eliminating isobutanol.\n# This reaction also does not affect the chiral center at C3.\n# Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n# Since the product is (S), the starting material B must also be (S).\n# B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n# Step 4: Combine the results and select the correct option.\n# A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n# B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n# This combination matches option C.\n\nfinal_choice = 'C'\n\nprint(f\"Based on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry, the correct starting materials are:\")\nprint(f\"A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\")\nprint(f\"B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option: {final_choice}\")\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Based on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry, the correct starting materials are:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nThis corresponds to option: C\n<<<C>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\nThe product for both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand the structure.\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom in the ring is assigned position 1.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   This structure is a δ-lactone (delta-lactone), which is a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring.\n*   The molecule has a single stereocenter at carbon 4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThe structure of the lactone is as follows (with IUPAC numbering):\n```\n      O(1)\n     /   \\\nC(6)H2 -- C(2)=O\n|         |\nC(5)H2 -- C(3)H2\n   \\     /\n    C(4)H(Et)\n```\nThis lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The specific hydroxy acid required is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The ethyl group is on C3 of the acid, which becomes C4 of the lactone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that at C5, there is an ester group with an isobutyl alcohol component (-COO-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n*   The structure has a single stereocenter at C3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n    O                                O\n   //                               //\nHO--C(1)--CH2(2)--CH(3)--CH2(4)--C(5)--O--CH2--CH(CH3)2\n                  |\n                  CH2CH3\n```\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is selective for esters over carboxylic acids. It will reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Reduction of the ester at C5: `...-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl` is reduced to `...-CH₂(4)-C(5)H₂-OH`.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)-OH`\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) protonates intermediates and catalyzes the subsequent intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the stable six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 of the product). Thus, the spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is unchanged.\n    *   However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are: H, Ethyl, `-CH₂-COOH` (let's call this G_acid), and `-CH₂-COOiBu` (let's call this G_ester). Comparing G_acid and G_ester, the ester group has higher priority. So, the priority order is: G_ester > G_acid > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Product:** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are: H, Ethyl, `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from G_acid), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from G_ester). Comparing these, the group derived from the acid has higher priority. So, the priority order is: (from G_acid) > (from G_ester) > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the two main chain substituents have swapped. This means that if the starting material has an (S) configuration, the product will have an (R) configuration (and vice-versa).\n    *   Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A must be (S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that is selective for carboxylic acids over esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Reduction of the carboxylic acid at C1: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-...` is reduced to `HO-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-...`.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        `HO-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl`\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (from the reduced C1) attacks the ester carbonyl at C5, displacing isobutanol to form the same six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Again, the reactions do not occur at the chiral center. We must check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as before. Priority order: G_ester > G_acid > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Product:** Same lactone as in Reaction 1. The group derived from the original ester (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`) has higher priority than the group derived from the original acid (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`). So, the priority order is: (from G_ester) > (from G_acid) > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center is maintained throughout the reaction sequence. This means that the configuration is retained. An (S) starting material will give an (S) product.\n    *   Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B must be (S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same compound. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe problem involves two separate reactions starting from stereoisomers of the same compound, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, and producing stereoisomers of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the selectivity of the two reducing agents and how the stereochemistry is affected.\n\n**Starting Material Structure:**\nThe starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.

The chiral center is at carbon-3 (C3), marked with an asterisk in some representations.\n\n**Product Structure:**\nThe product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a lactone (a cyclic ester).

This C4 atom corresponds to the C3 atom of the starting material.\n\n**Reagent Selectivity:**\n1.  **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n2.  **BH₃ (Borane):** This is also a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does **not** typically reduce esters under these conditions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group of starting material A to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    ```\n          Et\n          |\n    HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu   --(1) LiBH₄-->   HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--CH2OH\n          (A)                                     (Intermediate hydroxy acid)\n    ```\n2.  **Lactonization Step:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the carboxylic acid group and the newly formed hydroxyl group to form the six-membered lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the carbonyl centers, which are two carbons away from the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is not altered (no inversion or racemization occurs). However, the R/S designation might change if the chemical transformation alters the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂COOiBu (higher priority than the acid group because isobutyl > H)\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂COOH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), the ring fragment -CH₂C(=O)O-, and the ring fragment -CH₂CH₂O-.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂C(=O)O-\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂CH₂O-\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Mapping Priorities:** In this reaction, the ester group (-CH₂COOiBu, Priority 1 in A) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- fragment (Priority 2 in the product). The acid group (-CH₂COOH, Priority 2 in A) becomes the -CH₂C(=O)O- fragment (Priority 1 in the product).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** Since the groups with priorities 1 and 2 in the starting material have their priorities swapped in the product, the R/S designation will be inverted.\n        *   (S)-A → (R)-Lactone\n        *   (R)-A → (S)-Lactone\n    *   The problem states that the product is the **(R)-lactone**. Therefore, the starting material **A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of starting material B to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n    ```\n          Et\n          |\n    HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu   --(1) BH₃-->   HOCH2--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu\n          (B)                                     (Intermediate hydroxy ester)\n    ```\n2.  **Lactonization Step:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, displacing isobutanol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction does not alter the configuration of the chiral center. We must check the CIP priorities.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as for A.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂COOiBu\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂COOH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** Same as before.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂C(=O)O-\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂CH₂O-\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Mapping Priorities:** In this reaction, the ester group (-CH₂COOiBu, Priority 1 in B) becomes the -CH₂C(=O)O- fragment (Priority 1 in the product). The acid group (-CH₂COOH, Priority 2 in B) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- fragment (Priority 2 in the product).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The group with priority 1 in the starting material becomes the group with priority 1 in the product. The group with priority 2 becomes the group with priority 2. The priority order of the substituents is preserved. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained.\n        *   (S)-B → (S)-Lactone\n        *   (R)-B → (R)-Lactone\n    *   The problem states that the product is the **(S)-lactone**. Therefore, the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, A and B, we must analyze the two reactions, paying close attention to the reagents and the stereochemistry of the products.\n\nThe starting material in the options is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which has two carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). It also has a chiral center at the 3-position. The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which forms from the cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The stereochemistry of the chiral center at the 4-position of the lactone is specified in each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄)\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at the C5 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched. This forms 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid to form the lactone.\n\nThe reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the stereocenter at C3 of the starting material, which becomes the C4 stereocenter of the lactone product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n*   **Starting Material A:** (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### Reaction B\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃)\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBorane is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group at the C1 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the isobutyl ester group at C5 intact. This forms isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry at the C3 position is retained throughout the reaction sequence. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Starting Material B:** (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products:\n*   Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of different reducing agents towards functional groups, specifically esters and carboxylic acids.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting materials are stereoisomers of a dicarboxylic acid monoester: `(R)-` or `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu). The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The formation of this six-membered ring lactone occurs through the reduction of one of the carbonyl-containing groups to an alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n**Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material (A) to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains largely unaffected. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxyl group and catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed hydroxyl group and the existing carboxylic acid group to form the delta-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at carbon 3 (C3) of the starting material is not involved in the reaction and becomes the stereocenter at carbon 4 (C4) of the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. Since the product is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **A** must have been **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃), often used as a complex with THF (BH₃-THF), is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material (B) to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group remains intact. The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl of the isobutyl ester, forming the delta-lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the stereocenter at C3 is unaffected and becomes C4 in the product. The stereochemistry is retained. Since the product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **B** must have been **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3), and how they react with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials. The starting material options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), which forms from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy acid.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu --(LiBH4)--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH + iBuOH`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chiral center is at the C3 position of the starting acid, which becomes the C4 position in the lactone product. Since the bonds to this chiral center are not broken or formed during the reduction or lactonization, its stereochemical configuration is retained. Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH3) is a strong reducing agent that is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, even in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu --(BH3)--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, leading to the formation of the lactone and the release of isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center is retained throughout the process. To produce the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe product in both cases is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group, which is known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\nLactones like this are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Specifically, a delta-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. The precursor to our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's verify the naming:\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\nWhen the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid on carbon 1, it forms a six-membered ring. The atoms in the ring are -O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-. According to IUPAC nomenclature for heterocycles, the oxygen is position 1, the carbonyl carbon is 2, and the carbon with the ethyl group is position 4. Thus, the name is **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. The chiral center in the starting acid (C3) becomes the chiral center in the lactone (C4).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule has two key functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH)\n2.  An **ester** (-CO-O-iBu)\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a relatively mild reducing agent. It selectively reduces aldehydes, ketones, and **esters**. It does **not** reduce carboxylic acids (or their conjugate bases, carboxylates).\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n### **3. Elucidate the Pathway for Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄\n*   **Product:** (R)-lactone\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group of compound A to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched (it will be deprotonated to a carboxylate salt).\n    `(A) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(1. LiBH₄)--> [⁻OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH] Li⁺`\n2.  **Workup and Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate and the alkoxide, forming the intermediate **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. This hydroxy acid then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> (lactone) + H₂O`\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Elucidate the Pathway for Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃\n*   **Product:** (S)-lactone\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group of compound B to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched.\n    `(B) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(1. BH₃; 2. workup)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu`\n2.  **Cyclization:** The product of this reduction is a hydroxy-ester (**isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**). During the acidic workup (H⁺), this molecule can undergo an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) and forming the stable six-membered lactone.\n    `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(H⁺)--> (lactone) + iBuOH`\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** As in reaction 1, the reaction steps do not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a delta-lactone. The structure is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (O1), a carbonyl group (C2=O), and an ethyl group at the C4 position. The reactions yield different stereoisomers, (R) and (S), at the chiral C4 center.\n*   **Lactone Precursor:** A delta-lactone like this is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Specifically, the precursor is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is C3, which corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product.\n*   **Starting Materials (from options):** The proposed starting materials are of the form \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. The structure is `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`. This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is at C3, the carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagent is LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH4 is a moderately strong reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n        2.  This reduction yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n            `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(LiBH4)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n        3.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to form the final lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Neither the reduction of the ester nor the subsequent lactonization affects the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is directly transferred to the product. To obtain **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n        *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagent is BH3 (Borane)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH3 is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. While it can reduce esters, it does so much more slowly than it reduces carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid in the presence of the ester.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) will remain unchanged.\n        2.  This reduction yields isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n            `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(BH3)--> `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        3.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the reduction of the carboxylic acid and the subsequent transesterification do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained. To obtain **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n        *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce aldehydes, ketones, and **esters** to alcohols. However, it is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. Therefore, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ will preferentially reduce the **ester**.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent exhibits the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, often faster than it reduces esters. Therefore, in a molecule containing both functional groups, BH₃ will preferentially reduce the **carboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material, A, has both a carboxylic acid and an ester group.\n    2.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate which is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the -OH group and the -COOH group to form the final six-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material (A) is the same as the stereochemistry of the product. Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A must be the (R)-enantiomer**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material, B, is the other enantiomer.\n    2.  BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate which is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and displacing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As before, the chiral center is not affected by the reaction sequence. Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce a substituted lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. A lactone is a cyclic ester. \"Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" indicates a 6-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (position 1) and a carbonyl group (position 2). This is a delta-lactone. The ethyl group is at position 4, which is the chiral center.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name and draw the structure. It is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n    *   Structure: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   This molecule has two different functional groups: an ester and a carboxylic acid.\n    *   It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), the one bearing the ethyl group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reducing Agents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 with Borane (BH₃):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids (`-COOH`) to primary alcohols (`-CH₂OH`) much faster than it reduces esters (`-COOR`).\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with BH₃. The `-COOH` group is reduced to `-CH₂OH`. The ester group is unaffected.\n        2.  The intermediate formed is `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n        3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) and forming the 6-membered lactone ring.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 with Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH₄ and can reduce esters. While it also reduces carboxylic acids, it is generally faster with esters. The problem's design implies a selective reduction. Given that BH₃ targets the acid, LiBH₄ must be intended to target the ester.\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with LiBH₄. The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n        2.  The intermediate formed is `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n        3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl to form the lactone.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product depends on how the groups attached to the chiral center in the starting material are transformed. We need to apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`):**\n    The chiral center is C3. The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` (Highest priority, let's call it **P1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Second priority, **P2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, Third priority, **P3**)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, **P4**)\n    *Reasoning for P1 > P2:* The chains are identical until the final part of the functional group: `-O-iBu` vs `-OH`. Comparing the atoms attached to the oxygen, Carbon (in isobutyl) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Product (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one):**\n    The chiral center is C4. The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (ring fragment towards the carbonyl, Highest priority, **P'1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (ring fragment towards the ring oxygen, Second priority, **P'2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, Third priority, **P'3**)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, **P'4**)\n    *Reasoning for P'1 > P'2:* Comparing the ring fragments atom by atom from the chiral center, the first point of difference is at the second carbon away: a carbonyl carbon (`=O`) in P'1 versus a methylene carbon (`-CH₂-`) in P'2. The carbonyl carbon is considered to be bonded to more oxygen atoms, giving it higher priority.\n\n### **4. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nNow, let's trace how the groups and their priorities change in each reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 (B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone):**\n    *   The `-COOH` group (**P2**) is reduced to `-CH₂OH`, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the lactone (**P'2**).\n    *   The `-COOiBu` group (**P1**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` part of the lactone (**P'1**).\n    *   So, **P1 → P'1** and **P2 → P'2**. The priority order of the groups is preserved.\n    *   This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of configuration.\n    *   Since the product is **(S)**, the starting material B must also be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 (A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone):**\n    *   The `-COOiBu` group (**P1**) is reduced to `-CH₂OH`, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the lactone (**P'2**).\n    *   The `-COOH` group (**P2**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` part of the lactone (**P'1**).\n    *   So, **P1 → P'2** and **P2 → P'1**. The priorities of the top two groups are swapped.\n    *   Swapping the priorities of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of configuration.\n    *   Since the product is **(R)**, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction 1, starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For Reaction 2, starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth A and B are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe problem requires identifying the correct stereoisomers of a starting material that lead to specific stereoisomers of a product after reduction with two different reagents.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. The options provide the name as (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to the structure HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu, where the chiral center is at carbon 3.\n\nThe product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone, which is formed from the cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center at C3 of the starting acid becomes C4 in the lactone, and its stereochemistry is retained throughout the reaction sequences described.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will reduce the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n1.  **Reduction:**\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    The product of this step is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Lactonization:**\n    Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the resulting hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n\nSince the reactions do not affect the chiral center, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\nThus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBorane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, it will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n1.  **Reduction:**\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    The product of this step is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n\n2.  **Lactonization:**\n    Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the resulting hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to Reaction A, the stereochemistry at the chiral center is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nThus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃, and how they react with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material in the options is a dicarboxylic acid monoester: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can be structurally represented as `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n\nThe product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This lactone is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (`HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`).\n\nTherefore, the overall transformation requires the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups of the starting material to a primary alcohol, followed by cyclization. The stereochemistry at the C3 position of the starting acid corresponds to the C4 position of the product lactone, and this stereocenter is not affected by the reduction reactions.\n\n### Reaction A\n*   **Reagents**: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH₄**: Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with LiBH₄. The ester is reduced, yielding the intermediate 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Since the reaction does not alter the chiral center, the stereochemistry of the starting material A must match the stereochemistry of the product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n*   **Reagents**: BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of BH₃**: Borane is a reducing agent that is highly selective for carboxylic acids, reducing them much faster than esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with BH₃. The carboxylic acid is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, yielding the intermediate isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As with the first reaction, the chiral center is preserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis of the two reactions relies on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃).\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The starting material, a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, possesses both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol. This creates a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate. Under acidic workup (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular esterification, known as lactonization, to form a stable six-membered ring lactone.\n\nThe stereocenter at the third carbon of the starting material becomes the stereocenter at the fourth carbon of the lactone product. Since the reduction and lactonization steps do not alter the configuration of this stereocenter, the configuration of starting material A must be the same as the product. Therefore, to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nBorane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, forming a 5-hydroxyester intermediate. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) facilitates an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the lactone and the release of isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the final lactone product. To yield (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n*   **Pyran:** A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro:** The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. The oxygen atom is at position 1, making this a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone:\n```\n      O-1\n     / \\\n H2C-6    C-2(=O)\n  |       |\n H2C-5   CH2-3\n   \\     /\n     CH-4\n      |\n     CH2CH3\n```\nThe chiral center is at C4, which has the ethyl group. The reactions produce the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this molecule.\n\n**2. Determine the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxy-carboxylic acids. A six-membered delta-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. To find the structure of the precursor acid, we can mentally break the ester bond (O1-C2) of the lactone and add water (H to O1 and OH to C2).\n\n```\nLactone (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one)   --->   Hydroxy Acid\n```\nOpening the ring gives a straight-chain acid with an alcohol group:\n`HO-C6-C5-C4(Et)-C3-C2-COOH`\n\nRenumbering this chain according to IUPAC rules for carboxylic acids (COOH is C1):\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`\n\nThe precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center in this acid is at C3. This C3 becomes the C4 in the lactone product. The stereochemistry at this center is not affected by the reduction or the subsequent cyclization.\n*   To form **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(R)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   To form **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(S)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials and the Transformation**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This name describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The `...pentanoic acid` suffix indicates a free carboxylic acid group at C1.\n\nStructure of the starting material:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-COO-isobutyl(5)`\n\nTo get from this starting material to the intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid), the following transformation must occur:\n`HOOC...-COO-isobutyl`  --> `HOOC...-CH2OH`\n\nThis means the **ester group** must be selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, while the **carboxylic acid group** remains unchanged. Since the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction, its configuration will be retained.\n\n**4. Correlate Starting Materials with Products**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-lactone\n    *   To get the (R)-lactone, we need the (R)-hydroxy acid intermediate.\n    *   To get the (R)-hydroxy acid, we must start with the (R)-acid-ester.\n    *   Therefore, **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   *Reagent Check*: LiBH4 is a reducing agent. When it reacts with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester, it first reacts with the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate (`-COO⁻`). This carboxylate is much less reactive towards reduction than the ester group. Thus, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester to a primary alcohol, which is consistent with the required transformation.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-lactone\n    *   To get the (S)-lactone, we need the (S)-hydroxy acid intermediate.\n    *   To get the (S)-hydroxy acid, we must start with the (S)-acid-ester.\n    *   Therefore, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   *Reagent Check*: BH3 is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. However, if that were the case here, it would lead to a different product (a 7-membered lactone). Given that the product is the 6-membered lactone, we must conclude that in this specific molecule, BH3 reduces the ester group. This unusual selectivity can be explained by an intramolecular reaction where the borane first coordinates to the carboxylic acid and then delivers a hydride to the ester carbonyl at the other end of the molecule. This leads to the required reduction of the ester group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the stereochemical outcome and the necessary chemical transformation:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe analysis of the chemical reactions and reagents leads to the following conclusions:\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are all derivatives of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid, specifically the mono-isobutyl ester. The full name is (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-isobutyl). The stereocenter is at carbon 3, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered cyclic ester (lactone). The stereocenter in the product is at carbon 4. This carbon corresponds to the stereocenter at carbon 3 of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly determines the stereochemistry of the product, as the reduction and cyclization reactions do not affect this chiral center.\n\n**Reaction A:**\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4). This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 reduces the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group remains largely unaffected.\n*   **Intermediate:** This reaction forms 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n*   **Final Step:** The intermediate hydroxy acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is **(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Since the reaction preserves the stereocenter, the starting material **A** must have the (R) configuration. Therefore, A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3). This reagent is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The isobutyl ester group remains intact.\n*   **Intermediate:** This reaction forms isobutyl 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n*   **Final Step:** This intermediate hydroxy ester undergoes an acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is **(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Since the reaction preserves the stereocenter, the starting material **B** must have the (S) configuration. Therefore, B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the known selectivity of the reducing agents and the conservation of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct starting materials:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures:** First, we need to understand the chemical structures of the product, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` (a delta-lactone), and the potential starting materials, which are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This starting material is a dicarboxylic acid derivative with both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group.\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Intermediate:** The formation of the lactone product requires a precursor molecule that has both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. We will determine the structure of this hydroxy acid intermediate.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (with LiBH4):** We will examine the selectivity of the reducing agent Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`). It selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. We'll see how this transforms the starting material **A** into the hydroxy acid intermediate and then the final (R)-lactone product, allowing us to deduce the stereochemistry of **A**.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (with BH3):** We will examine the selectivity of the reducing agent Borane (`BH3`). It selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. We'll see how this transforms the starting material **B** into a hydroxy-ester, which then cyclizes to the final (S)-lactone product.

Let's draw its structure.\n    *   The backbone is a pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) derivative.\n    *   It has an ethyl group at C3: HOOC¹-CH₂²-C³H(Et)-CH₂⁴-C⁵OOH.\n    *   One of the carboxylic acids is esterified with isobutanol. The name \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\" indicates that the carboxylic acid at C5 is the one esterified.\n    *   Structure: HOOC¹-CH₂²-C³H(Et)-CH₂⁴-C⁵(=O)O-iBu.\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3.\n\n*   **Product (P):** The product is either (R)- or (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n    *   This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n    *   The \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" indicates a 6-membered ring with one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group at position 2 (next to the ring oxygen).\n    *   An ethyl group is at position 4.\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C4.\n    *   The formation of this lactone requires a molecule of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which then undergoes intramolecular esterification.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities for the substituents at the chiral centers.**\n\n*   **At C3 of the Starting Material:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    a) -H\n    b) -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n    c) -CH₂COOH (carboxyl group side)\n    d) -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu (ester group side)\n\n    To determine the priorities of (c) and (d), we look at the atoms attached to the carbon of the -CH₂- group. Both are carbons. We then look at what those carbons are attached to.\n    *   For -CH₂-**C**OOH: This carbon is attached to an -OH group and a =O group. Using the phantom atom method, this is equivalent to being attached to three oxygen atoms: (O, O, O).\n    *   For -CH₂-**C**(=O)O-iBu: This carbon is attached to an -O-iBu group and a =O group. The ether oxygen is attached to a carbon. So this is equivalent to being attached to (O, O, C).\n    *   Comparing (O, O, O) and (O, O, C), the first point of difference is the third atom. Oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon. Therefore, the -CH₂COOH group has higher priority than the -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu group.\n    *   The priority order at C3 is:\n        1.  -CH₂COOH\n        2.  -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃\n        4.  -H\n\n*   **At C4 of the Product:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral C4 are:\n    a) -H\n    b) -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n    c) -CH₂-C(=O)O- (the part of the ring leading to the carbonyl)\n    d) -CH₂-CH₂-O- (the part of the ring leading to the ether oxygen)\n\n    To determine the priorities of (c) and (d), we look at the atoms along each path.\n    *   Path (c): C4 -> C3 -> C2. The C2 atom is a carbonyl carbon, attached to two oxygens.\n    *   Path (d): C4 -> C5 -> C6. The C6 atom is a methylene carbon, attached to one oxygen.\n    *   Comparing the atoms attached to the second carbon in each chain (C2 vs C6), C2 (bonded to O, O) takes priority over C6 (bonded to O, H, H).\n    *   The priority order at C4 is:\n        1.  -CH₂-C(=O)O-\n        2.  -CH₂-CH₂-O-\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃\n        4.  -H\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters to alcohols but reacts very slowly with carboxylic acids. Thus, it will selectively reduce the isobutoxycarbonyl group.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu is reduced at the ester group to give 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH.\n    2.  The resulting hydroxy acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the product. The hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH) attacks the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction does not occur at the chiral center (C3).\n    *   Let's see how the substituents' priorities change.\n        *   The -CH₂COOH group (Priority 1 in SM) becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- group in the product ring (Priority 1 in P).\n        *   The -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu group (Priority 2 in SM) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂-CH₂-O- group in the product ring (Priority 2 in P).\n    *   Since the priority order of the substituents around the chiral center is preserved (1→1, 2→2, 3→3), the stereochemical configuration is **retained**.\n    *   To obtain an (R)-product, the starting material A must have an (R)-configuration.\n    *   Therefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** BH₃ (Borane) is a selective reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols much faster than it reduces esters. Thus, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu is reduced at the acid group to give isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu.\n    2.  The resulting hydroxy ester undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification (lactonization). The new hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction does not occur at the chiral center (C3).\n    *   Let's see how the substituents' priorities change.\n        *   The -CH₂COOH group (Priority 1 in SM) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂-CH₂-O- group in the product ring (Priority 2 in P).\n        *   The -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu group (Priority 2 in SM) becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- group in the product ring (Priority 1 in P).\n    *   The priorities of the two highest-ranked substituents are **swapped** (SM Priority 1 → P Priority 2; SM Priority 2 → P Priority 1).\n    *   When the priorities of two groups are swapped while their spatial arrangement remains the same, the R/S designation is **inverted**.\n    *   To obtain an (S)-product, the starting material B must have an (R)-configuration.\n    *   Therefore, **B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials A and B must be the same compound: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A and B):** The chemical name provided is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's break this down to understand its structure.\n    *   \"Pentanoic acid\": A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1).\n    *   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the third carbon (C3).\n    *   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\": This indicates that at the fifth carbon (C5), there is an ester group. Specifically, it's an isobutyl ester (-COOCH₂(CH₃)₂).\n    *   The structure is therefore a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid: `HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)`.\n    *   This molecule has a chiral center at C3, which can have either an (R) or (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\": This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group next to it (a δ-lactone).\n    *   \"4-ethyl\": An ethyl group is on the fourth carbon of the ring (numbering starts from the ring oxygen as 1, carbonyl carbon as 2).\n    *   The chiral center in the product is at C4.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe transformation from the starting material to the lactone product requires the reduction of one carbonyl group to an alcohol, followed by an intramolecular cyclization (lactonization). The key to solving this problem lies in the different chemoselectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\nThe chiral center in the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4). The chemical reactions (reduction and cyclization) occur at the ends of the molecule (C1 and C5) and do not involve breaking or forming any bonds at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R or S) of the starting material is retained in the product.\n\n*   An (R)-starting material will produce an (R)-lactone.\n*   An (S)-starting material will produce an (S)-lactone.\n\n### **3. Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a nucleophilic reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols. However, it is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids because the acidic proton is first removed to form a carboxylate anion (-COO⁻), which is electron-rich and repels the incoming nucleophilic hydride (BH₄⁻).\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the C1 carboxylic acid untouched.\n        `A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) --LiBH₄--> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes the intramolecular esterification between the C5-hydroxyl group and the C1-carboxylic acid, forming the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** The product of this reaction is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is an electrophilic reducing agent. It is exceptionally effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. While it can also reduce esters, its reaction with carboxylic acids is much faster. Thus, it selectively reduces the carboxylic acid in the presence of an ester.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the C5 isobutyl ester untouched.\n        `B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) --BH₃--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed C1-hydroxyl group attacks the C5-ester carbonyl, forming the same six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** The product of this reaction is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nAn analysis of the two reactions is required to determine the correct starting materials, A and B. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the selectivity of the two different reducing agents and tracing the stereochemistry from the starting material to the product.\n\n### **Analysis of the Product**\n\nBoth reactions yield a lactone (a cyclic ester) named 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, differing only in their stereochemistry at the C4 position. A tetrahydropyran-2-one is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group at the C2 position (a delta-lactone). This structure is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. In this specific case, the precursor must be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The stereocenter at C3 of this precursor becomes the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone product. The stereochemistry is retained during this cyclization.\n\n*   To form the **(R)**-lactone, the precursor must be **(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   To form the **(S)**-lactone, the precursor must be **(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This is a derivative of a five-carbon dicarboxylic acid (3-ethylglutaric acid) where the C1 is a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the C5 is an isobutyl ester (-COO-isobutyl). The stereocenter is at C3, which corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product.\n\nThe goal of each reaction is to convert the starting material into the corresponding 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid precursor, which then cyclizes. This requires the selective reduction of the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Transformation:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the C1 carboxylic acid untouched. This correctly forms the necessary (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid precursor from starting material A.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reaction does not affect the stereocenter, starting material **A must have the (R) configuration** to produce the (R)-lactone.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols, typically leaving esters unaffected under the same conditions.\n*   **Transformation:** Based on standard textbook selectivity, BH₃ would reduce the carboxylic acid at C1, not the ester at C5. This would result in a hydroxy-ester intermediate that cannot form the specified lactone product. This indicates a likely flaw in the premise of the question for this specific reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** However, to arrive at the specified (S)-lactone product, the reaction would need to proceed by reducing the ester group, just as in Reaction 1. Assuming the question intends for this outcome despite the incorrect choice of reagent, the stereochemistry would be preserved. Therefore, to produce the (S)-lactone, starting material **B must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the chemically sound analysis of Reaction 1 and the logical inference for the intended (though chemically inaccurate) Reaction 2, the stereochemistry of the starting materials can be determined:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the two reactions, paying close attention to the reagents and their known selectivities.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\nThe general structure of the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-isobutyl). The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This lactone is formed by reducing one of the two carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol, which then cyclizes by reacting with the remaining carbonyl group. The stereochemistry at the chiral center (C4 of the product, which was C3 in the starting material) is a key detail.\n\n**Reaction A:**\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄)\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group first reacts with LiBH₄ in an acid-base reaction to form a lithium carboxylate salt. This salt is resonance-stabilized and much less reactive towards reduction than the ester group. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The isobutyl ester of compound **A** is reduced to a primary alcohol, forming an intermediate hydroxy acid.\n    2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at C3. Thus, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃)\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** Borane (often used as a complex, like BH₃·THF) is well-known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid of compound **B** is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, forming an intermediate hydroxy ester.\n    2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), this hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to yield the lactone and isobutanol as a byproduct.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, the stereochemistry is preserved. Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the chemo-selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** must have the (R) configuration.\n*   Starting material **B** must have the (S) configuration.\n\nThis corresponds to the following selection:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe analysis of the search results confirms the initial reasoning.\n\n*   **Selectivity of BH3:** Borane (BH3) selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. This is a well-established principle in organic chemistry. The reaction proceeds through an acyloxyborane intermediate which is then further reduced.\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH4:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. While less common than NaBH4 or LiAlH4, its specific niche is this selective reduction of esters.\n*   **Reaction Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the carbonyl groups by these hydride reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) and the subsequent intramolecular cyclization (lactonization or transesterification) do not affect the configuration of the existing chiral center at C3 of the starting material's carbon chain.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly dictates the stereochemistry of the lactone product in both reactions.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n**Reaction A:**\n1.  **Reagent:** LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)\n2.  **Starting Material A:** (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n3.  **Action of LiBH4:** Selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact.\n    `A --(LiBH4)--> (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid + isobutanol`\n4.  **Cyclization:** The resulting hydroxy-acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) upon workup (H+).\n    `(R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid --(H+)--> (R/S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The stereocenter is retained throughout the process. Since the product is **(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, the starting material A must have been **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n1.  **Reagent:** BH3 (Borane)\n2.  **Starting Material B:** (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n3.  **Action of BH3:** Selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n    `B --(BH3)--> Isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`\n4.  **Cyclization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification upon workup (H+).\n    `Isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate --(H+)--> (R/S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one + isobutanol`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The stereocenter is also retained in this reaction sequence. Since the product is **(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, the starting material B must have been **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nCombining these findings:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. Let's analyze its structure and how it's formed.\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** A saturated six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (position 1) and a carbonyl group (at position 2).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   **Stereocenter:** The carbon at position 4 is chiral because it's attached to four different groups (H, ethyl, -CH2C(=O)O-, and -CH2CH2O-).\n*   **Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. In this case, the precursor would be 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\nLet's trace the atoms from the open-chain precursor to the cyclic product:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\nThe hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the carboxylic acid group at C1 to form the six-membered ring.\n*   The stereocenter in the open-chain precursor is C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n*   During cyclization, C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone.\n*   Crucially, the reaction (cyclization) does not involve breaking any bonds at the stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R/S) of the starting material is retained in the product.\n    *   An (R)-precursor will form an (R)-lactone.\n    *   An (S)-precursor will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe proposed starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This name describes a molecule with a five-carbon chain, a carboxylic acid at one end (C1), and an isobutyl ester at the other end (C5). The ethyl group is at C3.\n*   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`\n*   This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has the same stereocenter at C3 as the lactone precursor.\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with known chemoselectivity:\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** A mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** A reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material A, which is an enantiomer of `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`, is treated with LiBH4.\n    2.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is left unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As established, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained throughout the process. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** `A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material B, the other enantiomer, is treated with BH3.\n    2.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-COO-iBu`) is left unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) to form the same lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** `B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product**\n\nBoth reactions yield a lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group (a delta-lactone). It has an oxygen atom at position 1 and a carbonyl group at position 2. The ring is saturated (\"tetrahydro\").\n*   **Substitution:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4.\n*   **Chirality:** Carbon 4 is a chiral center. The product of reaction 1 is the (R)-enantiomer, and the product of reaction 2 is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      O\n     //\n  C(2)---O(1)\n /       \\\nC(3)H2   C(6)H2\n|         |\nC(4)H----C(5)H2\n|\nCH2CH3\n```\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Transformation**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Structure:** This is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid). It has a free carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu) at the other end (C5). An ethyl group is at C3.\n*   **Chirality:** Carbon 3 is the chiral center in the starting material.\n\nThe overall transformation involves converting this dicarboxylic acid monoester into a lactone. A lactone is formed from a hydroxy-acid. Specifically, the product is a delta-lactone, which forms from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n\nThis means the starting material, `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`, must be converted into the intermediate `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid). This requires the selective reduction of the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) of the hydroxy-acid to form the final lactone product.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1: Reagent LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is strong enough to reduce the ester but generally does not react with the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Transformation:** LiBH₄ correctly performs the required transformation: it reduces the ester group at C5 to an alcohol, leading to the hydroxy-acid intermediate and then the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical reaction (reduction) occurs at C5, which is not the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration** at the chiral center. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules change for the substituents on the chiral center.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (C3):**\n        1.  `-CH₂-COO-iBu` (ester group has priority over acid group)\n        2.  `-CH₂-COOH`\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Priorities in Product (C4):** The chiral center C3 becomes C4. The groups transform as follows:\n        *   `-CH₂-COO-iBu` (Start Priority 1) → `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Product Priority 2)\n        *   `-CH₂-COOH` (Start Priority 2) → `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (Product Priority 1)\n        *   `-CH₂CH₃` (Start Priority 3) → `-CH₂CH₃` (Product Priority 3)\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereodescriptor:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. Due to this change in CIP priorities, the R/S descriptor will flip even though the spatial arrangement of the groups is retained. An (S) starting material will yield an (R) product, and an (R) starting material will yield an (S) product.\n\n*   **Final Deduction for A:** The product is the **(R)-lactone**. Since the reaction causes an S→R inversion of the name, the starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2: Reagent BH₃**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) typically reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters. However, in dicarboxylic acid monoesters like this one, a special mechanism called **anchimeric assistance** occurs. The BH₃ first reacts with the free carboxylic acid to form an acyloxyborane intermediate (`-COO-BH₂`). This borane group is then held close to the ester carbonyl, allowing it to deliver a hydride intramolecularly, reducing the ester. This intramolecular reaction is faster than the intermolecular reduction of a simple ester. Therefore, in this specific case, BH₃ also selectively reduces the ester group.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the same as with LiBH₄: the ester at C5 is reduced, leading to the lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction mechanism does not involve the chiral center C3, so it also proceeds with **retention of configuration**. The same change in CIP priorities occurs as in Reaction 1. Therefore, an (R) starting material will yield an (S) product.\n\n*   **Final Deduction for B:** The product is the **(S)-lactone**. Since the reaction causes an R→S inversion of the name, the starting material **B** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis problem requires understanding the specific reactivity of different reducing agents towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group, as well as tracking the stereochemistry of the reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures\n\n*   **Starting Material (A and B):** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this structure:\n    *   It's a five-carbon chain (pentanoic acid derivative).\n    *   It has a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at one end (C1).\n    *   It has an isobutyl ester group (`-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) at the other end (C5).\n    *   It has an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) at C3.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is a chiral center, meaning the starting material can exist as (R) or (S) enantiomers.\n\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n    *   This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone.\n    *   Lactones are formed by the intramolecular reaction of a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid (or ester) group. For a six-membered ring, this means a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid derivative must have cyclized.\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) is now C4 in the lactone product. Since the reactions do not involve breaking bonds at the chiral center, its configuration (R or S) will be retained.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1 and the Selectivity of LiBH₄\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 is left unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this intermediate to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at C5 and C1, not at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is retained. To produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2 and the Selectivity of BH₃\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a unique reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 is left unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center at C3 is not affected. The stereochemical configuration is retained. To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand the structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom is at position 1. This entire functional group, a cyclic ester, is called a **lactone**. Specifically, it's a delta-lactone because the oxygen is on the 5th carbon relative to the carbonyl carbon in the open-chain precursor.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   **(R)-** or **(S)-**: This refers to the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is a 6-membered lactone. This type of molecule is typically formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor must be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. Let's verify this:\nHOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)\nUpon acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification, the -OH group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1. The resulting lactone will have the ethyl group at position 4 (C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone), which matches the product name.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's decode this IUPAC name:\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This describes the substituent at C5. It means the C5 carbon is part of an isobutyl ester group (-C(=O)O-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n\nSo, the structure is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one carboxylic acid group is free (at C1) and the other (at C5) is esterified with isobutanol.\nStructure: **HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)**\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It also has a single chiral center at C3, the carbon with the ethyl group.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group at C5 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the final 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5, while the stereocenter is at C3. No bonds to the stereocenter are broken or formed, so its configuration is retained. To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must be the **(R)**-isomer.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, especially in the presence of less reactive esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to reaction A, the reactions occur at C1 and C5, and the stereocenter at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must be the **(S)**-isomer.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the two reactions and the selectivity of the reducing agents involved.\n\n**The Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The reactions produce (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester formed from a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an alcohol group. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of a dicarboxylic acid where one acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, which has the ethyl group.\n\n**Analyzing the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe formation of the lactone product requires one of the carbonyl groups in the starting material to be reduced to an alcohol, followed by cyclization (lactonization). The key to this problem lies in the different chemoselectivities of the two reducing agents, borane (BH₃) and lithium borohydride (LiBH₄).\n\n*   **Reaction with BH₃ (Borane):** Borane is well-known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids much more rapidly than esters. In the presence of both functional groups, BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Reaction with LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and is capable of reducing esters. Crucially, LiBH₄ is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Reaction 2 (Compound B + BH₃):**\n    *   Reagent: BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid.\n    *   Reaction: The -COOH group of compound B is reduced to a -CH₂OH group, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n    *   Intermediate: This forms a 5-hydroxy ester.\n    *   Cyclization: Under acidic workup (H⁺), the newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone.\n    *   Stereochemistry: This sequence of reactions (reduction and lactonization) does not affect the existing stereocenter at position 3 of the starting material, which becomes position 4 in the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material.\n    *   Conclusion: Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Reaction 1 (Compound A + LiBH₄):**\n    *   Reagent: LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester.\n    *   Reaction: The isobutyl ester group of compound A is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n    *   Intermediate: This forms a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    *   Cyclization: Under acidic workup (H⁺), the alcohol group attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl, eliminating water to form the lactone.\n    *   Stereochemistry: As in the first reaction, the stereocenter is not altered during this process. The stereochemistry of the starting material dictates the stereochemistry of the product.\n    *   Conclusion: Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nTo determine the proper starting materials, A and B, we must analyze the two reactions, paying close attention to the reagents and the stereochemistry of the products.\n\n### Analysis of the Starting Material and Products\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Its structure contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is at the C3 carbon, which has an ethyl group attached.\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a type of cyclic ester known as a lactone. The formation of this six-membered ring lactone occurs when a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes. The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone product. Crucially, the reduction and subsequent lactonization steps do not alter the configuration (R or S) of this chiral center. Therefore, an (R)-starting material will yield an (R)-product, and an (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The product is the (R)-enantiomer. This directly implies that the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent. While it can reduce both esters and carboxylic acids, it is known to be more selective for the reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. In this reaction, LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization (lactonization) of the resulting hydroxy acid to form the (R)-lactone.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The product is the (S)-enantiomer. This indicates that the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent well-known for its high chemoselectivity. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters. In this case, BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The resulting hydroxy-ester then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification (lactonization) to yield the (S)-lactone.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the stereochemistry of the products and the known selectivity of the reducing agents:\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)-enantiomer** to produce the (R)-lactone.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)-enantiomer** to produce the (S)-lactone.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze how each reducing agent reacts with the functional groups present and how this affects the stereochemistry of the final product.\n\nThe potential starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-CO-O-iBu). The molecule has a chiral center at carbon 3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\n### **Reaction A**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride), followed by H⁺ workup.\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (a lactone)\n\n**Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n\n**Reaction Pathway:**\n1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the resulting 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone product.\n\n**Stereochemical Analysis:**\n1.  **Assigning Priorities:** We must use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to assign priorities to the groups attached to the chiral center (carbon 3) in the starting material.\n    *   Groups on C3: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH (acid), and -CH₂COOiBu (ester).\n    *   Priorities: **1.** -CH₂COOiBu > **2.** -CH₂COOH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n2.  **Transformation Effect:** The reduction converts the ester group into a -CH₂CH₂OH group. The chiral center itself is not altered, but the priorities of its adjacent groups change.\n    *   In the intermediate hydroxy acid (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`), the priority order becomes: **1.** -CH₂COOH > **2.** -CH₂CH₂OH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n3.  **Configuration Change:** The group that was priority #1 in the starting material is now priority #2 in the intermediate, and the group that was #2 is now #1. This swap in the priority of two groups inverts the stereochemical designation (R/S). Therefore, an (S) starting material will become an (R) intermediate.\n4.  **Final Step:** The cyclization of the (R)-hydroxy acid to the (R)-lactone does not change the configuration at the chiral center.\n5.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the (R)-product, the starting material A must be the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\n### **Reaction B**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane), followed by H⁺ workup.\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n**Reaction Pathway:**\n1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the resulting 5-hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone product and isobutanol.\n\n**Stereochemical Analysis:**\n1.  **Assigning Priorities:** The priorities for the starting material B are the same as for A:\n    *   Priorities: **1.** -CH₂COOiBu > **2.** -CH₂COOH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n2.  **Transformation Effect:** The reduction converts the carboxylic acid group into a -CH₂CH₂OH group. Let's examine the priorities in the intermediate hydroxy ester (`HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`).\n    *   Priority order: **1.** -CH₂COOiBu > **2.** -CH₂CH₂OH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n3.  **Configuration Change:** The group that was priority #1 (-CH₂COOiBu) remains priority #1. The group that was priority #2 (-CH₂COOH) is reduced but the new group (-CH₂CH₂OH) is still priority #2 relative to the ethyl group. The priority order of the substituents does not change. Therefore, the stereochemical designation (R/S) is retained. An (S) starting material will give an (S) intermediate.\n4.  **Final Step:** The cyclization of the (S)-hydroxy ester to the (S)-lactone does not change the configuration.\n5.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the (S)-product, the starting material B must be the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Product\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's deconstruct this name:\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**: This is a six-membered saturated ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring) and a ketone/carbonyl group at position 2. This structure is a cyclic ester, also known as a lactone. Specifically, it's a δ-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon-4 of the ring.\n*   **(R)- or (S)-**: This refers to the stereochemistry at the chiral center. In this molecule, the only chiral center is carbon-4, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n\nA lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. A six-membered δ-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor for our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\n\nUpon acid-catalyzed cyclization (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1, forming the six-membered lactone. The carbon atoms of the acid map to the lactone ring as follows:\n*   C1 (acid) → C2 (lactone carbonyl)\n*   C3 (acid, with ethyl group) → C4 (lactone, with ethyl group)\n\nThe key point is that the stereocenter at C3 of the acid becomes the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone, and this cyclization reaction **does not change the R/S configuration**.\n*   An (R)-hydroxy acid will produce an (R)-lactone.\n*   An (S)-hydroxy acid will produce an (S)-lactone.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Starting Materials\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This name describes a molecule with a five-carbon chain that has:\n*   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1).\n*   An isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) at the other end (C5).\n*   An ethyl group at C3, which is the chiral center.\n\nThe structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOiBu(5)`\n\nThis molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one acid group is free and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions\n\nWe need to convert the starting material, which has a carboxylic acid and an ester, into the product, a lactone. This involves selectively reducing one of the two carbonyl functional groups to an alcohol, which can then cyclize.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It does not reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n### Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction**: LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group (-COOiBu at C5) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH at C1) remains unchanged.\n    `A [HOOC-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-COOiBu] --(LiBH₄)--> HOOC-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n2.  **Intermediate**: The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n3.  **Lactonization**: The H⁺ workup protonates the intermediate and catalyzes the cyclization to form the lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry**: This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C3. To obtain the **(R)-lactone** product, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n5.  **Conclusion for A**: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction**: BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH at C1) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group (-COOiBu at C5) remains largely unchanged.\n    `B [HOOC-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-COOiBu] --(BH₃)--> HOCH₂-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-COOiBu`\n2.  **Intermediate**: The intermediate formed is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Lactonization**: The H⁺ workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the six-membered lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry**: This reaction sequence also does not affect the stereocenter. To obtain the **(S)-lactone** product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n5.  **Conclusion for B**: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere's a breakdown of the chemical reactions to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe final product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a lactone (a cyclic ester). Lactones are typically formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy acid. The specific hydroxy acid needed to form the product is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\nThe provided starting materials are all derivatives of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-iBu) at the other (C5).\n\nTo get the necessary hydroxy acid intermediate, one of these functional groups must be selectively reduced to an alcohol while the other remains a carboxylic acid. The stereocenter at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone product) is not affected by the reduction reactions. Therefore, the stereochemistry (R or S) of the starting material will directly correspond to the stereochemistry of the product.\n\nLet's examine the selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n\n**Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is well-known for its ability to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** LiBH₄ will reduce the ester group at the C5 position of starting material A to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched.\n    *   A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH\n*   The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent addition of acid (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since LiBH₄ is used to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have been **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃ (Borane)**\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a highly selective reducing agent that rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while typically being much less reactive towards esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** This presents a seeming contradiction, as reducing the carboxylic acid would initially yield a hydroxy-ester (HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu), which cannot directly cyclize into the required lactone. However, the reaction is followed by an acid workup (H⁺). This acidic step can serve a dual purpose: it not only catalyzes the lactonization but can also hydrolyze the isobutyl ester to a carboxylic acid. The most established and highly selective role of BH₃ is the reduction of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu) + BH₃ → HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu\n*   During the acid workup (H⁺), two things happen: the ester is hydrolyzed, and the resulting hydroxy acid cyclizes.\n    *   HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu + H⁺/H₂O → HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH + iBuOH\n    *   This hydroxy acid is *not* the correct one for the target lactone.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the BH₃ reaction. Given the options, there must be a viable pathway. An alternative interpretation is that BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to an alcohol, and the subsequent workup first hydrolyzes the ester at C5 to a carboxylic acid and *then* the lactone is formed. This would result in 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, the same intermediate as in the LiBH₄ reaction.\n\n*   **Revised Reaction B Pathway:**\n    1.  Reduction of COOH with BH₃: (S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu → (S)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu\n    2.  Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and lactonization: The hydroxy-ester is worked up with acid, leading to the hydrolysis of the ester and subsequent cyclization. The intermediate would be the same 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\nSince this pathway forms the lactone, we look at the stereochemistry. The reaction produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. As the stereocenter is unaffected, the starting material B must have been **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Starting Material A:** Reacts with LiBH₄ to form the (R)-lactone. Since LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester and stereochemistry is retained, A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Starting Material B:** Reacts with BH₃ to form the (S)-lactone. Since BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid and stereochemistry is retained, B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nMy thinking process to solve this problem involves breaking down the chemical reactions step-by-step, focusing on the selectivity of the reagents and the stereochemical outcomes.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structures:** First, I identify the structures of the starting material and the product.\n    *   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOCH2CH(CH3)2`) at the other (C5). It has a chiral center at C3, where an ethyl group is attached.\n    *   **Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). It has a chiral center at C4, where the ethyl group is attached. This C4 in the product corresponds to the C3 in the starting material.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-product`\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a specific reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters to alcohols but does not react with carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        1.  `LiBH4` reduces the isobutyl ester group on starting material A to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is left untouched. This forms a hydroxy-acid intermediate: `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n        2.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the alcohol group attacks the carboxylic acid group to form the six-membered ring of the product lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this process, the chemical bonds to the chiral center (C3 in the starting material, which becomes C4 in the product) are not broken. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with *retention of configuration*. To get the **(R)-product**, the starting material **A must be the (R)-enantiomer**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-product`\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (`BH3`) is another specific reducing agent, but it has the opposite selectivity of `LiBH4`. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        1.  `BH3` reduces the carboxylic acid group on starting material B to a primary alcohol. The ester group is left untouched. This forms a hydroxy-ester intermediate: `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n        2.  The acidic workup (`H+`) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`HOCH2CH(CH3)2`) and forming the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, the bonds to the chiral center are not affected. This reaction also proceeds with *retention of configuration*. To get the **(S)-product**, the starting material **B must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   From Reaction 1, we determined: **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   From Reaction 2, we determined: **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n5.  **Final Choice:** This combination corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes two chemical reactions to determine the correct starting materials.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the reactions:\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analysis of Reaction 1 ---\n    print(\"--- Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one ---\")\n    print(\"1.

Let's break down this name:\n    *   \"pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n    *   \"tetrahydro\" means the ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n    *   \"2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring.\n    *   This structure is a δ-lactone (a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring).\n    *   \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 4.\n    *   The numbering for the pyranone ring starts with the ring oxygen as position 1, and the carbonyl carbon as position 2.\n    *   The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, an ethyl group, a -CH₂-C=O group (part of the ring), and a -CH₂-CH₂-O- group (part of the ring).\n*   **Lactone Formation:** A δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The specific precursor for 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one must be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)-OH\n    *   When this molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxyl group at C1. The C3 of the acid chain (which has the ethyl group) becomes the C4 of the lactone ring. The stereochemistry at this carbon is preserved during lactonization.\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options provide isomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's determine its structure.\n    *   This name describes a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid is free and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5). The chiral center is at C3.\n    *   The goal of both reactions is to transform this starting material into 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which then cyclizes to the product lactone. This requires the selective reduction of the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (-COO-iBu) at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The H⁺ workup quenches the reaction and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the δ-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence does not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral C3 center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. The (R/S) configuration of the starting material A at C3 will be the same as the (R/S) configuration of the product lactone at C4.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a strong reducing agent. It is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Careful Point - The \"Trick\" in the Question:** If BH₃ followed its standard selectivity, it would reduce the -COOH group at C1 to -CH₂OH, leaving the ester at C5 intact. The resulting molecule (an ester of a 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid derivative) would cyclize to form a 7-membered lactone (an ε-lactone), not the 6-membered lactone (δ-lactone) specified in the product.\n*   **Correct Mechanism for this Substrate:** For dicarboxylic acid monoesters like glutaric acid derivatives, borane exhibits an unusual selectivity. The carboxylic acid first reacts with BH₃ to form an acyloxyborane intermediate (R-COO-BH₂). This intermediate then forms a stable six-membered ring by chelating with the carbonyl oxygen of the nearby ester group. This chelation activates the *ester* carbonyl, directing a second molecule of BH₃ to reduce the ester group instead of the acyloxyborane.\n*   **Mechanism Summary:**\n    1.  Despite the usual selectivity of BH₃, in this specific case, an intramolecular chelate directs the reduction to the ester group.\n    2.  The net result is the same as with LiBH₄: the ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol, and the carboxylic acid at C1 is preserved (regenerated during H⁺ workup).\n    3.  The intermediate is again 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  Lactonization under acidic conditions yields the δ-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This mechanism also does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Based on the analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n*   This corresponds to the option where:\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nLet's match this to the given options.\nOption D matches our findings.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Starting Material Structure**\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   Reaction A yields `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   Reaction B yields `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   These products are enantiomers of a delta-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester). The stereocenter is at carbon 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\n*   **Starting Materials:**\n    *   The options for starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Let's draw this structure. The parent chain is \"pentanoic acid\", so there is a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1. At C5, there is an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`). An ethyl group is at C3.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-isobutyl`.\n    *   This molecule is a dicarboxylic acid derivative (specifically, a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid). It has two reducible functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. The stereocenter is at C3.\n\n**2. Analyze the Lactone Formation Pathway**\n\nThe product is a six-membered lactone. This is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a C5-hydroxy carboxylic acid or a C5-hydroxy ester.\n\n*   The crucial point is how the stereocenter in the starting material relates to the stereocenter in the product.\n    *   Starting Material Chiral Center: C3 (`...-CH(Et)-...`)\n    *   Lactone Product Chiral Center: C4 (`...-CH(Et)-...`)\n*   The reduction reactions at C1 (carboxylic acid) or C5 (ester) do not involve the chiral center at C3. The subsequent cyclization also does not affect this center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained throughout the reaction sequence.\n*   This means an `(R)`-configured starting material will produce an `(R)`-configured lactone, and an `(S)`-configured starting material will produce an `(S)`-configured lactone.\n    *   `(R)-...starting material` --> `(R)-...lactone`\n    *   `(S)-...starting material` --> `(S)-...lactone`\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nWe need to consider the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH₄` and `BH₃`, towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagent is LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   **Reactivity:** `LiBH₄` is a reducing agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols much more readily than it reduces carboxylic acids. It is often used for the selective reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction Path:**\n        1.  `LiBH₄` selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` --(LiBH₄)--> `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        2.  The resulting intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n        3.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** Since Reaction A produces the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material `A` must have the `(R)` configuration.\n    *   **Therefore, A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagent is BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   **Reactivity:** `BH₃` (usually used as `BH₃·THF`) is a reducing agent renowned for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while being unreactive towards esters under the same conditions.\n    *   **Reaction Path:**\n        1.  `BH₃` selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` --(BH₃)--> `HOH₂C-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n        2.  The resulting intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n        3.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification of this hydroxy ester. The terminal hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) to form the six-membered lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** Since Reaction B produces the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material `B` must have the `(S)` configuration.\n    *   **Therefore, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the reagents' selectivity and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material `A` is `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   Starting material `B` is `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nBased on the principles of organic chemistry and the confirmed selectivity of the reducing agents, the following analysis determines the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe goal is to produce two different stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. Lactones are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of hydroxy acids. In this case, the precursor to the product is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes to form the δ-lactone. The reactions start with a dicarboxylic acid monoester, specifically a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The key to solving this problem lies in the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n1.  **Reaction A with LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group first reacts as an acid, getting deprotonated by the hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Compound A, which is (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid), has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid will remain untouched (after being deprotonated and then reprotonated during the acidic workup).\n    *   **Intermediate:** The reduction of the ester group in Compound A yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (cyclization) of the 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to form the δ-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical transformations do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Reaction B with BH₃ (Borane):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Compound B, with the same functional groups, is treated with BH₃. The BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact. This initially forms a hydroxy ester. During the acidic workup (H⁺), the ester is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The reduction of the carboxylic acid group followed by hydrolysis of the ester in Compound B yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   **Lactonization:** As in the first reaction, this hydroxy acid then cyclizes under the acidic conditions to form the δ-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction sequence does not affect the chiral center. The configuration of the starting material is retained in the final product. To produce (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Summary**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** (R)-starting material + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone\n*   **Reaction B:** (S)-starting material + BH₃ → (S)-lactone\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, A and B, we must analyze the reactants and products of both reactions. Both reactions result in a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The key lies in the selectivity of the two different reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The proposed starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This name suggests a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one carboxylic acid has been converted to an isobutyl ester. This structure possesses two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu). It also has a single chiral center at the carbon with the ethyl group.\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is a six-membered lactone, which is formed from the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the functional groups (the acid and the ester), not at the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the ethyl-bearing carbon is retained throughout the reaction. An (R)-configured starting material will produce an (R)-configured product, and an (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is not reduced.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is unreacted (or exists as its lithium salt).\n    2.  Acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate to form 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  This hydroxy acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to form the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product has the (R) configuration and the stereocenter is not altered, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group is unaffected.\n    2.  The resulting molecule is a hydroxy-ester.\n    3.  This intermediate cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification (catalyzed by the acidic workup), eliminating isobutanol to form the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product has the (S) configuration and the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis, A is the (R)-isomer and B is the (S)-isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), and how they interact with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials.\n\nThe proposed starting materials are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-COO-isobutyl) at the other. The product in both reactions is a δ-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester), formed by the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups to an alcohol, followed by intramolecular cyclization. The stereocenter at the C4 position (bearing the ethyl group) of the lactone corresponds to the C3 position in the starting material. Crucially, this chiral center is not directly involved in the reduction or cyclization reactions, so its stereochemistry is expected to be retained from the starting material to the product.\n\n#### Reaction A: Starting Material A + LiBH₄ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. While it can reduce carboxylic acids, the reaction is much slower compared to the reduction of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** In this reaction, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group will remain largely unreacted. The resulting intermediate is (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** Following the reduction, an acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl at C1, forming the stable six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the stereocenter is retained, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n#### Reaction B: Starting Material B + BH₃ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH₃), typically used as a complex with THF or dimethyl sulfide, is a strong reducing agent that shows high selectivity for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, even in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will preferentially reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact. The intermediate formed is isobutyl (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Cyclization:** The acid workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol at one end of the molecule attacks the ester carbonyl at the other end, displacing isobutanol to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center is preserved during this process. Therefore, to form the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nBased on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product of both reactions is a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break this down:\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring), which is saturated (tetrahydro) and has a carbonyl group (ketone, C=O) at the C-2 position. This specific structure is a delta-lactone. The ring atoms are O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)-.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center. The problem specifies the product of reaction 1 is the (R)-enantiomer and the product of reaction 2 is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Identify the Lactone Precursor**\n\nLactones are cyclic esters formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. To form the six-membered ring of the product, a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid is needed. Let's deduce the structure of the linear precursor:\n*   Breaking the ester bond in the lactone (between O-1 and C-2) and adding H2O conceptually gives a linear molecule.\n*   The O-1 gets an H to become an alcohol (-OH). The C-2 gets an OH to become a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   The linear chain is HOOC(C2)-C3-C4(Et)-C5-C6-(OH).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature for the acid, the carboxylic acid carbon is C1. So the structure is:\n    HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH.\n*   The name of this precursor is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n*   The chiral center in this acid is C-3. Upon cyclization, C-3 of the acid becomes C-4 of the lactone. Since the bonds to the chiral center are not broken during lactonization, the stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n    *   (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe options provided list the starting material as \"(R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This name describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\nThe structure is: **HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu** (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2).\nThis molecule has two functional groups that can be reduced:\n*   A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   An ester (-COOiBu)\nIt also has a chiral center at C-3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe two reducing agents have different selectivities:\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** A mild reducing agent that reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters, but it does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** A strong reducing agent that readily reduces carboxylic acids. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids much faster than esters, allowing for selective reduction.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material A (HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu) is treated with LiBH4.\n    2.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is left unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid).\n    4.  Under acidic workup (H+), this hydroxy-acid undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form the lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction converts the ester group to an alcohol, but it does not affect the chiral center at C-3. The stereochemistry is retained throughout the process.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the final product is the (R)-lactone, the intermediate must be the (R)-hydroxy-acid, which means the starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material B (HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu) is treated with BH3.\n    2.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group (-COOiBu) is initially unaffected due to the much faster reduction of the acid.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    4.  During the acidic workup (H+), the alcohol group on one end of the molecule attacks the ester carbonyl on the other end. This intramolecular transesterification reaction forms the stable six-membered lactone ring and displaces isobutanol (iBuOH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction pathway also does not involve breaking any bonds at the C-3 chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the final product is the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-ester must have the (S) configuration, which means the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B is the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nA) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure and Stereochemistry**\n\nThe product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of lactone (a cyclic ester). Let's break down its structure:\n*   **-pyran-**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom in the ring is position 1.\n*   **4-ethyl-**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n(6)C----C(5)\n |      |\n |    C(4)-CH2CH3\n |      |\n(2)C=O--C(3)\n```\n\nThis six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed by the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The linear precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**:\n\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n\nDuring cyclization, the -OH group from C5 attacks the carboxylic acid carbon (C1). The carbon that was C3 in the acid chain (the one with the ethyl group and the chiral center) becomes C4 in the lactone. The reaction (lactonization) does not affect the stereochemistry of this chiral center.\n\nTherefore:\n*   To produce **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(R)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   To produce **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(S)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe starting materials given in the options are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's draw its structure. This is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one carboxylic acid group is a free acid and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\n(where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2)\n\nThe molecule has two carbonyl-containing functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOR). The chiral center is at C3, the same carbon that becomes the chiral center in the product.\n\n**3. Determine the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe key to this problem is understanding how the two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, react with a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) while leaving the carboxylic acid (-COOH) intact.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) while leaving the ester (-COOiBu) intact.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1 (Starting material A with LiBH4)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 will reduce the ester end of the starting material.\n    `A [HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu] ---(1) LiBH4---> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n*   The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The acidic workup (H+) causes this intermediate to cyclize to the lactone product.\n*   Since the final product is the **(R)**-lactone, the intermediate must be the **(R)**-hydroxy acid. As the reaction doesn't change the stereocenter, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5.

As the reaction doesn't change the stereocenter, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of two different reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group.

Let's break down this structure:\n        *   It is a derivative of pentanoic acid, which is a 5-carbon carboxylic acid.\n        *   At C3, there is an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`). This carbon is a chiral center.\n        *   At C5, there is an isobutyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂`).\n        *   The full structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group.\n    *   **Product:** The product in both reactions is \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\", a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center is at C4, which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material. Since the chemical reactions do not occur at the chiral center itself, the stereochemistry (R/S configuration) of this center will be retained from the starting material to the product.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagent Selectivity:**\n    *   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This is a moderately strong, nucleophilic reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It reacts with the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻`), which is resistant to further reduction by the nucleophilic hydride (BH₄⁻).\n    *   **Borane (BH₃):** This is a strong, electrophilic reducing agent. It has a very high preference for reducing carboxylic acids, reacting with them much faster than with esters.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  Since LiBH₄ is used, the **ester group** is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is not reduced.\n            `A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate and catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry at the chiral center is retained throughout the reaction. Therefore, to produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  Since BH₃ is used, the **carboxylic acid group** is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester group is not reduced under these selective conditions.\n            `B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu) + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n        2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry at the chiral center is also retained in this reaction. Therefore, to produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Final Determination:**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions yield a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**: This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring system). It is saturated (\"tetrahydro\") and has a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2, making it a lactone (specifically, a delta-lactone).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon-4 of the ring.\n*   **Chiral Center**: The carbon at position 4, which is bonded to the ethyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon atoms within the ring, is a chiral center.\n*   **(R) and (S)**: The prefixes indicate the stereochemical configuration at this C4 chiral center.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  H2C(6) C=O (2)\n   |    |\n  H2C(5) CH2(3)\n   \\   /\n    CH (4)\n    |\n    CH2CH3\n```\n*   **Reaction 1 Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2 Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options for the starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Pentanoic acid**: A 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group on carbon-3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that the carboxylic acid at the C5 position has been converted into an isobutyl ester (-COO-CH2CH(CH3)2).\n*   This molecule is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one acid group is free and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n  HOOC(1) — CH2(2) — CH(3) — CH2(4) — C(=O)(5) — O-isobutyl\n                       |\n                       CH2CH3\n```\n*   **Functional Groups**: It contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an ester (-COOR') at C5.\n*   **Chiral Center**: The carbon at position 3, bonded to the ethyl group, is the chiral center.\n*   The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) isomer of this molecule.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the selective reactivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)**: A relatively mild reducing agent. It readily reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. **It does not reduce carboxylic acids under normal conditions.**\n*   **BH3 (Borane)**: A powerful reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. While it can also reduce esters, the reaction with carboxylic acids is significantly faster. Therefore, it can be used to selectively reduce a carboxylic acid in the presence of an ester.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: In both reaction pathways, the chemical transformations (reduction and cyclization) occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and not at the chiral center (C3). This means the original stereochemistry of the C3 carbon is retained throughout the reaction. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product. Therefore:\n*   An (R)-starting material will yield an (R)-product.\n*   An (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n\n### **4. Applying the Logic to Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reduction**: `LiBH4` selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO(isobutyl)`  ---`LiBH4`--->  `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n2.  **Lactonization**: The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The product is the **(R)-lactone**. Since the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material **A** must have been the **(R)-isomer**.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reduction**: `BH3` selectively reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester at C5 untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO(isobutyl)`  ---`BH3`--->  `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO(isobutyl)`\n2.  **Lactonization**: The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutyl alcohol to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The product is the **(S)-lactone**. Since the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material **B** must have been the **(S)-isomer**.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), and understand the subsequent cyclization reactions.\n\nThe potential starting materials are all isomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂). The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group remains largely unreacted.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of compound A to a primary alcohol. This creates a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The subsequent addition of acid (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification, known as lactonization, to form the stable six-membered ring lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The series of reactions (reduction and lactonization) does not affect the stereocenter at the carbon bearing the ethyl group. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A must be the same as the product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B: Reduction with BH₃\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that exhibits the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group of compound B to a primary alcohol, resulting in a 5-hydroxyester. The acidic workup (H⁺) then promotes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence also preserves the original stereocenter.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nCombining these findings, reactant A is the (R)-isomer and reactant B is the (S)-isomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of two different reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and Borane (BH₃), and how they affect the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n1.  **Starting Material Structure:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other has been converted to an isobutyl ester. The chiral center is at carbon 3, which has an ethyl group attached. The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n2.  **Reaction A:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:** In starting material A, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) untouched.\n    *   **Lactonization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) causes the molecule to undergo intramolecular esterification. The newly formed alcohol group attacks the carboxylic acid group, forming a stable six-membered cyclic ester, which is called a lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and lactonization reactions do not affect the chiral center at carbon 3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material. Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, starting material A must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n3.  **Reaction B:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:** In starting material B, BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the isobutyl ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) untouched.\n    *   **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol attacks the ester, displacing isobutanol and forming the same six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chemical transformations do not alter the existing stereocenter. The configuration of the product will match the configuration of the starting material. Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   To produce (R)-lactone with LiBH₄, the starting material **A** must be **(R)**.\n*   To produce (S)-lactone with BH₃, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe initial analysis was correct. Let's formalize the answer based on the confirmed selectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reagents:**\n    *   **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄):** The search results confirm that LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. While it is stronger than sodium borohydride, it is milder than lithium aluminum hydride and will not reduce a carboxylic acid functional group. The reaction of LiBH₄ with a dicarboxylic acid monoester results in the reduction of the ester group to an alcohol, which then allows for the formation of a lactone.\n    *   **Borane (BH₃):** The search results clearly state that borane (often as a THF or dimethyl sulfide complex) is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids over esters.\n\n*   **Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    1.  The starting material A is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid: (S)- or (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    2.  The reagent, LiBH₄, selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    3.  This creates a hydroxy acid intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylic acid, which then undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) with the newly formed hydroxyl group to yield the δ-lactone product.\n    5.  The chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material becomes the chiral center at the 4-position of the lactone. This center is not involved in the reduction or cyclization reactions, so its stereochemistry is retained.\n    6.  Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have been **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    1.  The starting material B is also a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid: (S)- or (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    2.  The reagent, BH₃, selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    3.  This creates a hydroxy ester intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) likely catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction, where the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone ring and displacing isobutanol.\n    5.  As in the first reaction, the stereocenter at the 3-position is unaffected and retains its configuration.\n    6.  Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have been **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine the proper starting materials, A and B, a step-by-step analysis of each reaction is required, focusing on two key aspects: the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the effect of the chemical transformation on the stereochemical designation (R/S) of the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Structures and Chemical Principles**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at the C3 position.\n2.  **Product:** The product is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The chiral center in the product is at the C4 position.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions do not break or form bonds at the chiral center itself, meaning the absolute three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents, which can change as the functional groups are modified. This is a crucial point of analysis.\n4.  **Reagent Selectivity:**\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **Step 2: Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Analysis**\n\nTo track the stereochemistry, we must assign priorities to the groups attached to the chiral center in both the starting material and the product.\n\n*   **At the chiral C3 of the Starting Material:** The attached groups are H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH (acid side), and -CH₂COOiBu (ester side).\n    *   Comparing the acid and ester sides, the ester group has a higher priority because the oxygen of its `-OR` group is attached to a carbon (from isobutyl), while the oxygen of the acid's `-OH` group is attached to hydrogen. Since Carbon > Hydrogen, the priorities are:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH`\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n        4.  `-H`\n*   **At the chiral C4 of the Product (Lactone):** The attached groups are H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), `-CH₂C(=O)O-` (ring fragment toward carbonyl), and `-CH₂CH₂O-` (ring fragment toward ring oxygen).\n    *   Comparing the two ring fragments, the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` fragment has higher priority because its second carbon is a carbonyl carbon (higher oxidation state) compared to the methylene carbon in the `-CH₂CH₂O-` fragment. The priorities are:\n        1.  `-CH₂C(=O)O-`\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂O-`\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n        4.  `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester group** (`-CH₂COOiBu`), which was **priority #1** in the starting material. This group is transformed into the `-CH₂CH₂O-` fragment, which is **priority #2** in the product. The **acid group** (`-CH₂COOH`), which was **priority #2**, becomes the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` fragment, which is **priority #1** in the product.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped (1→2 and 2→1). This causes an **inversion of the R/S designation**.\n*   **Conclusion:** To obtain the **(R)-product**, the reaction must start from the opposite stereoisomer. Therefore, starting material **A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the **acid group** (`-CH₂COOH`), which was **priority #2** in the starting material. This group is transformed into the `-CH₂CH₂O-` fragment, which is **priority #2** in the product. The **ester group** (`-CH₂COOiBu`), which was **priority #1**, becomes the `-CH₂C(=O)O-` fragment, which is **priority #1** in the product.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is preserved (1→1 and 2→2). This causes a **retention of the R/S designation**.\n*   **Conclusion:** To obtain the **(S)-product**, the reaction must start from the same stereoisomer. Therefore, starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions must start with the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>"

This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one carboxylic acid has been converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\n**Structure of the Starting Material:**\n```\n      O-iBu\n     //\nHO-C-CH2-CH-CH2-C\n  ||      |    ||\n  O       Et   O\n  C1 C2  C3 C4 C5\n```\nThis is the general structure for starting materials A and B. The chiral center is at carbon C3. The reactions involve reducing either the carboxylic acid group (at C1) or the ester group (at C5) to a primary alcohol, followed by intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Structure of the Product:**\nThe product is a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  C(2)=O  C(6)\n  |       |\n C(3)----C(4)--Et\n         |\n        C(5)\n```\nSince the reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3), the absolute three-dimensional configuration of the stereocenter is preserved throughout the reaction sequence. However, the R/S designation might change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents on the chiral center change.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate, which is unreactive towards the nucleophilic hydride.\n2.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material A: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    *   Intermediate (Hydroxy Acid): `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid)\n3.  **Lactonization:** The intermediate hydroxy acid cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved during this step. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy acid must have the (R) configuration.\n4.  **Analysis of CIP Priorities:** We need to determine if the R/S designation changes from the starting material A to the intermediate hydroxy acid.\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Starting Material A:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority: C→C→O(C))\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority: C→C→O(H))\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Intermediate Hydroxy Acid:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (Highest priority: C→C→O,O,O)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Second priority: C→C→O,H,H)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Conclusion on Priorities:** The group that was priority #2 in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes priority #1 in the intermediate. The group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced and becomes part of the new priority #2 group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). Because the relative priorities of the top two groups have swapped, the R/S designation is inverted, even though the absolute configuration is unchanged.\n    *   Therefore: (S)-Starting Material A → (R)-Intermediate → (R)-Lactone.\n5.  **Result for A:** To get the (R)-lactone as the final product, the starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n2.  **Reduction Step:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material B: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    *   Intermediate (Hydroxy Ester): `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` (isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate)\n3.  **Lactonization:** The intermediate hydroxy ester cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy ester must have the (S) configuration.\n4.  **Analysis of CIP Priorities:** We need to determine if the R/S designation changes from the starting material B to the intermediate hydroxy ester.\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Starting Material B:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Groups on chiral C3 of Intermediate Hydroxy Ester:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (Second priority)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Conclusion on Priorities:** The group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains priority #1. The group that was priority #2 (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced but the resulting group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) is still priority #2 (since it's higher priority than the ethyl group). The priority order of the substituents (1 > 2 > 3) does not change.\n    *   Therefore: The R/S designation is preserved. (S)-Starting Material B → (S)-Intermediate → (S)-Lactone.\n5.  **Result for B:** To get the (S)-lactone as the final product, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products**\n\n*   **Reaction A Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction B Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBoth products are δ-lactones (six-membered cyclic esters). They are enantiomers of each other. The chiral center is at position 4 of the lactone ring.\n\n### **2. Determine the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nA δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\nThe structure of the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, indicates that its open-chain precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n*   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)OH\n\nThe chiral center in this precursor is at C3. Upon cyclization, the C3 of the acid becomes the C4 of the lactone. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the chiral center is conserved during the lactonization step.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will cyclize to (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will cyclize to (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Starting Materials and the Transformation**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's analyze its structure:\n\n*   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu\n\nThis molecule has two carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-iBu) at C5. The chiral center is at C3.\n\nTo get the required precursor (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) from this starting material, a reduction must occur. Comparing the structures, the ester group at C5 must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the carboxylic acid group at C1 must remain unchanged.\n\n**Transformation:**\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu  →  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n\n### **4. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\n**Reaction A:**\n*   **Starting Material A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization of the resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the precursor must be (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which in turn must come from the (R)-starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n*   **Starting Material B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that is well-known for its high chemoselectivity, typically reducing carboxylic acids much faster than esters. However, for the reaction to yield the given product (a 4-ethyl-lactone), the ester group must be reduced, not the carboxylic acid. Reduction of the carboxylic acid would lead to a different product (a 3-ethyl-lactone), which is not observed.\n*   **Mechanism:** We must infer from the product that under the conditions of this specific reaction, the BH₃ reagent reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) leads to the lactone. While this reactivity is atypical for BH₃, we must assume it occurs to yield the stated product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction A, the chiral center is not affected by the reduction or cyclization. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the precursor must be (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which must come from the (S)-starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester). The only difference is the stereochemistry at carbon 4, which is the chiral center bearing the ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material Structure:** The proposed starting materials are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-C(=O)O-iBu) at the other. The chiral center is at carbon 3, which corresponds to carbon 4 in the final lactone product.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acid).\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally *not* strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The ester group in the starting material is reduced to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu --(LiBH₄)--> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n        3.  Upon addition of acid (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. So, A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acid).\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH₃ is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group in the starting material is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu --(BH₃)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n        3.  Upon addition of acid (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to reaction 1, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. So, B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n5.  **Final Match:**\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the reagents and their selectivity.\n# LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) selectively reduces esters to alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n# BH3 (Borane) selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols but is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1.\n# A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n# The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid monoester: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu.\n# LiBH4 reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 intact.\n# The intermediate is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH.\n# Acid workup (H+) causes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n# The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the product).\n# Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n# Since the product is (R), the starting material A must also be (R).\n# A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2.\n# B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n# The starting material B has the same structure type.\n# BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester at C5 intact.\n# The intermediate is a 5-hydroxy ester: HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu.\n# Acid workup (H+) causes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, eliminating isobutanol.\n# This reaction also does not affect the chiral center at C3.\n# Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n# Since the product is (S), the starting material B must also be (S).\n# B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n# Step 4: Combine the results and select the correct option.\n# A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n# B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n# This combination matches option C.\n\nfinal_choice = 'C'\n\nprint(f\"Based on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry, the correct starting materials are:\")\nprint(f\"A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\")\nprint(f\"B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option: {final_choice}\")\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Based on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry, the correct starting materials are:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nThis corresponds to option: C\n<<<C>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\nThe product for both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand the structure.\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom in the ring is assigned position 1.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   This structure is a δ-lactone (delta-lactone), which is a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring.\n*   The molecule has a single stereocenter at carbon 4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThe structure of the lactone is as follows (with IUPAC numbering):\n```\n      O(1)\n     /   \\\nC(6)H2 -- C(2)=O\n|         |\nC(5)H2 -- C(3)H2\n   \\     /\n    C(4)H(Et)\n```\nThis lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The specific hydroxy acid required is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The ethyl group is on C3 of the acid, which becomes C4 of the lactone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that at C5, there is an ester group with an isobutyl alcohol component (-COO-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n*   The structure has a single stereocenter at C3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n    O                                O\n   //                               //\nHO--C(1)--CH2(2)--CH(3)--CH2(4)--C(5)--O--CH2--CH(CH3)2\n                  |\n                  CH2CH3\n```\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is selective for esters over carboxylic acids. It will reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Reduction of the ester at C5: `...-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl` is reduced to `...-CH₂(4)-C(5)H₂-OH`.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)-OH`\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) protonates intermediates and catalyzes the subsequent intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the stable six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 of the product). Thus, the spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is unchanged.\n    *   However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are: H, Ethyl, `-CH₂-COOH` (let's call this G_acid), and `-CH₂-COOiBu` (let's call this G_ester). Comparing G_acid and G_ester, the ester group has higher priority. So, the priority order is: G_ester > G_acid > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Product:** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are: H, Ethyl, `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from G_acid), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from G_ester). Comparing these, the group derived from the acid has higher priority. So, the priority order is: (from G_acid) > (from G_ester) > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the two main chain substituents have swapped. This means that if the starting material has an (S) configuration, the product will have an (R) configuration (and vice-versa).\n    *   Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A must be (S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that is selective for carboxylic acids over esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Reduction of the carboxylic acid at C1: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-...` is reduced to `HO-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-...`.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        `HO-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl`\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (from the reduced C1) attacks the ester carbonyl at C5, displacing isobutanol to form the same six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Again, the reactions do not occur at the chiral center. We must check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as before. Priority order: G_ester > G_acid > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Product:** Same lactone as in Reaction 1. The group derived from the original ester (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`) has higher priority than the group derived from the original acid (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`). So, the priority order is: (from G_ester) > (from G_acid) > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center is maintained throughout the reaction sequence. This means that the configuration is retained. An (S) starting material will give an (S) product.\n    *   Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B must be (S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same compound. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe problem involves two separate reactions starting from stereoisomers of the same compound, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, and producing stereoisomers of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the selectivity of the two reducing agents and how the stereochemistry is affected.\n\n**Starting Material Structure:**\nThe starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is:\n```\n      Et\n      |\nHOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu\n  1    2    3    4      5\n```\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is at carbon-3 (C3), marked with an asterisk in some representations.\n\n**Product Structure:**\nThe product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a lactone (a cyclic ester). Its structure is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  C(2)=O   C(6)H2\n /         \\\nC(3)H2       C(5)H2\n \\         /\n  C(4)H-Et\n```\nThe chiral center in the product is at carbon-4 (C4). This C4 atom corresponds to the C3 atom of the starting material.\n\n**Reagent Selectivity:**\n1.  **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n2.  **BH₃ (Borane):** This is also a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does **not** typically reduce esters under these conditions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group of starting material A to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    ```\n          Et\n          |\n    HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu   --(1) LiBH₄-->   HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--CH2OH\n          (A)                                     (Intermediate hydroxy acid)\n    ```\n2.  **Lactonization Step:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the carboxylic acid group and the newly formed hydroxyl group to form the six-membered lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the carbonyl centers, which are two carbons away from the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is not altered (no inversion or racemization occurs). However, the R/S designation might change if the chemical transformation alters the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂COOiBu (higher priority than the acid group because isobutyl > H)\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂COOH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), the ring fragment -CH₂C(=O)O-, and the ring fragment -CH₂CH₂O-.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂C(=O)O-\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂CH₂O-\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Mapping Priorities:** In this reaction, the ester group (-CH₂COOiBu, Priority 1 in A) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- fragment (Priority 2 in the product). The acid group (-CH₂COOH, Priority 2 in A) becomes the -CH₂C(=O)O- fragment (Priority 1 in the product).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** Since the groups with priorities 1 and 2 in the starting material have their priorities swapped in the product, the R/S designation will be inverted.\n        *   (S)-A → (R)-Lactone\n        *   (R)-A → (S)-Lactone\n    *   The problem states that the product is the **(R)-lactone**.

It also has a chiral center at the 3-position. The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which forms from the cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The stereochemistry of the chiral center at the 4-position of the lactone is specified in each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄)\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at the C5 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched. This forms 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid to form the lactone.\n\nThe reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the stereocenter at C3 of the starting material, which becomes the C4 stereocenter of the lactone product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n*   **Starting Material A:** (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### Reaction B\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃)\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBorane is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group at the C1 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the isobutyl ester group at C5 intact. This forms isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry at the C3 position is retained throughout the reaction sequence. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Starting Material B:** (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products:\n*   Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of different reducing agents towards functional groups, specifically esters and carboxylic acids.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting materials are stereoisomers of a dicarboxylic acid monoester: `(R)-` or `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu). The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The formation of this six-membered ring lactone occurs through the reduction of one of the carbonyl-containing groups to an alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n**Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material (A) to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains largely unaffected. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxyl group and catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed hydroxyl group and the existing carboxylic acid group to form the delta-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at carbon 3 (C3) of the starting material is not involved in the reaction and becomes the stereocenter at carbon 4 (C4) of the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. Since the product is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **A** must have been **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃), often used as a complex with THF (BH₃-THF), is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material (B) to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group remains intact. The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl of the isobutyl ester, forming the delta-lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the stereocenter at C3 is unaffected and becomes C4 in the product. The stereochemistry is retained. Since the product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **B** must have been **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3), and how they react with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials. The starting material options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), which forms from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy acid.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu --(LiBH4)--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH + iBuOH`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chiral center is at the C3 position of the starting acid, which becomes the C4 position in the lactone product. Since the bonds to this chiral center are not broken or formed during the reduction or lactonization, its stereochemical configuration is retained. Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH3) is a strong reducing agent that is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, even in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu --(BH3)--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, leading to the formation of the lactone and the release of isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center is retained throughout the process. To produce the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe product in both cases is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group, which is known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\nLactones like this are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Specifically, a delta-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. The precursor to our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's verify the naming:\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\nWhen the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid on carbon 1, it forms a six-membered ring. The atoms in the ring are -O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-. According to IUPAC nomenclature for heterocycles, the oxygen is position 1, the carbonyl carbon is 2, and the carbon with the ethyl group is position 4. Thus, the name is **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. The chiral center in the starting acid (C3) becomes the chiral center in the lactone (C4).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule has two key functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH)\n2.  An **ester** (-CO-O-iBu)\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a relatively mild reducing agent. It selectively reduces aldehydes, ketones, and **esters**. It does **not** reduce carboxylic acids (or their conjugate bases, carboxylates).\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It is much slower at reducing esters.\n\n### **3. Elucidate the Pathway for Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄\n*   **Product:** (R)-lactone\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group of compound A to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched (it will be deprotonated to a carboxylate salt).\n    `(A) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(1. LiBH₄)--> [⁻OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH] Li⁺`\n2.  **Workup and Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate and the alkoxide, forming the intermediate **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. This hydroxy acid then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> (lactone) + H₂O`\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Elucidate the Pathway for Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃\n*   **Product:** (S)-lactone\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group of compound B to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched.\n    `(B) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(1. BH₃; 2. workup)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu`\n2.  **Cyclization:** The product of this reduction is a hydroxy-ester (**isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**). During the acidic workup (H⁺), this molecule can undergo an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) and forming the stable six-membered lactone.\n    `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(H⁺)--> (lactone) + iBuOH`\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** As in reaction 1, the reaction steps do not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a delta-lactone. The structure is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (O1), a carbonyl group (C2=O), and an ethyl group at the C4 position. The reactions yield different stereoisomers, (R) and (S), at the chiral C4 center.\n*   **Lactone Precursor:** A delta-lactone like this is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Specifically, the precursor is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is C3, which corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product.\n*   **Starting Materials (from options):** The proposed starting materials are of the form \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. The structure is `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`. This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is at C3, the carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagent is LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH4 is a moderately strong reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n        2.  This reduction yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n            `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(LiBH4)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n        3.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to form the final lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Neither the reduction of the ester nor the subsequent lactonization affects the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is directly transferred to the product. To obtain **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n        *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagent is BH3 (Borane)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH3 is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. While it can reduce esters, it does so much more slowly than it reduces carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid in the presence of the ester.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) will remain unchanged.\n        2.  This reduction yields isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n            `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(BH3)--> `(isobutyl)-O-CO-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        3.  The acidic workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the reduction of the carboxylic acid and the subsequent transesterification do not affect the chiral center at C3.

Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce aldehydes, ketones, and **esters** to alcohols. However, it is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. Therefore, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ will preferentially reduce the **ester**.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent exhibits the opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, often faster than it reduces esters. Therefore, in a molecule containing both functional groups, BH₃ will preferentially reduce the **carboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material, A, has both a carboxylic acid and an ester group.\n    2.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate which is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the -OH group and the -COOH group to form the final six-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material (A) is the same as the stereochemistry of the product. Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A must be the (R)-enantiomer**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material, B, is the other enantiomer.\n    2.  BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate which is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and displacing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As before, the chiral center is not affected by the reaction sequence. Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce a substituted lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. A lactone is a cyclic ester. \"Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" indicates a 6-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (position 1) and a carbonyl group (position 2). This is a delta-lactone. The ethyl group is at position 4, which is the chiral center.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name and draw the structure. It is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n    *   Structure: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   This molecule has two different functional groups: an ester and a carboxylic acid.\n    *   It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), the one bearing the ethyl group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reducing Agents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 with Borane (BH₃):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids (`-COOH`) to primary alcohols (`-CH₂OH`) much faster than it reduces esters (`-COOR`).\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with BH₃. The `-COOH` group is reduced to `-CH₂OH`. The ester group is unaffected.\n        2.  The intermediate formed is `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n        3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) and forming the 6-membered lactone ring.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 with Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH₄ and can reduce esters. While it also reduces carboxylic acids, it is generally faster with esters. The problem's design implies a selective reduction. Given that BH₃ targets the acid, LiBH₄ must be intended to target the ester.\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with LiBH₄. The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n        2.  The intermediate formed is `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n        3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl to form the lactone.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product depends on how the groups attached to the chiral center in the starting material are transformed. We need to apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`):**\n    The chiral center is C3. The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` (Highest priority, let's call it **P1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Second priority, **P2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, Third priority, **P3**)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, **P4**)\n    *Reasoning for P1 > P2:* The chains are identical until the final part of the functional group: `-O-iBu` vs `-OH`. Comparing the atoms attached to the oxygen, Carbon (in isobutyl) has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in the Product (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one):**\n    The chiral center is C4. The four attached groups are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (ring fragment towards the carbonyl, Highest priority, **P'1**)\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (ring fragment towards the ring oxygen, Second priority, **P'2**)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group, Third priority, **P'3**)\n    4.  `-H` (Lowest priority, **P'4**)\n    *Reasoning for P'1 > P'2:* Comparing the ring fragments atom by atom from the chiral center, the first point of difference is at the second carbon away: a carbonyl carbon (`=O`) in P'1 versus a methylene carbon (`-CH₂-`) in P'2. The carbonyl carbon is considered to be bonded to more oxygen atoms, giving it higher priority.\n\n### **4. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nNow, let's trace how the groups and their priorities change in each reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 (B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone):**\n    *   The `-COOH` group (**P2**) is reduced to `-CH₂OH`, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the lactone (**P'2**).\n    *   The `-COOiBu` group (**P1**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` part of the lactone (**P'1**).\n    *   So, **P1 → P'1** and **P2 → P'2**. The priority order of the groups is preserved.\n    *   This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of configuration.\n    *   Since the product is **(S)**, the starting material B must also be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 (A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone):**\n    *   The `-COOiBu` group (**P1**) is reduced to `-CH₂OH`, which becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` part of the lactone (**P'2**).\n    *   The `-COOH` group (**P2**) is not reduced and becomes the `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` part of the lactone (**P'1**).\n    *   So, **P1 → P'2** and **P2 → P'1**. The priorities of the top two groups are swapped.\n    *   Swapping the priorities of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of configuration.\n    *   Since the product is **(R)**, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction 1, starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For Reaction 2, starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth A and B are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe problem requires identifying the correct stereoisomers of a starting material that lead to specific stereoisomers of a product after reduction with two different reagents.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. The options provide the name as (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to the structure HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu, where the chiral center is at carbon 3.\n\nThe product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone, which is formed from the cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center at C3 of the starting acid becomes C4 in the lactone, and its stereochemistry is retained throughout the reaction sequences described.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will reduce the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n1.  **Reduction:**\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    The product of this step is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Lactonization:**\n    Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the resulting hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n\nSince the reactions do not affect the chiral center, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\nThus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBorane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, it will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n1.  **Reduction:**\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    The product of this step is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n\n2.  **Lactonization:**\n    Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the resulting hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to Reaction A, the stereochemistry at the chiral center is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nThus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃, and how they react with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material in the options is a dicarboxylic acid monoester: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can be structurally represented as `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n\nThe product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This lactone is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (`HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`).\n\nTherefore, the overall transformation requires the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups of the starting material to a primary alcohol, followed by cyclization. The stereochemistry at the C3 position of the starting acid corresponds to the C4 position of the product lactone, and this stereocenter is not affected by the reduction reactions.\n\n### Reaction A\n*   **Reagents**: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH₄**: Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with LiBH₄. The ester is reduced, yielding the intermediate 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Since the reaction does not alter the chiral center, the stereochemistry of the starting material A must match the stereochemistry of the product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n*   **Reagents**: BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of BH₃**: Borane is a reducing agent that is highly selective for carboxylic acids, reducing them much faster than esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with BH₃. The carboxylic acid is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, yielding the intermediate isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As with the first reaction, the chiral center is preserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis of the two reactions relies on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃).\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The starting material, a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, possesses both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol. This creates a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate. Under acidic workup (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular esterification, known as lactonization, to form a stable six-membered ring lactone.\n\nThe stereocenter at the third carbon of the starting material becomes the stereocenter at the fourth carbon of the lactone product. Since the reduction and lactonization steps do not alter the configuration of this stereocenter, the configuration of starting material A must be the same as the product. Therefore, to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nBorane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, forming a 5-hydroxyester intermediate. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) facilitates an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the lactone and the release of isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the final lactone product. To yield (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n*   **Pyran:** A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro:** The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. The oxygen atom is at position 1, making this a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone:\n```\n      O-1\n     / \\\n H2C-6    C-2(=O)\n  |       |\n H2C-5   CH2-3\n   \\     /\n     CH-4\n      |\n     CH2CH3\n```\nThe chiral center is at C4, which has the ethyl group. The reactions produce the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this molecule.\n\n**2. Determine the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxy-carboxylic acids. A six-membered delta-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. To find the structure of the precursor acid, we can mentally break the ester bond (O1-C2) of the lactone and add water (H to O1 and OH to C2).\n\n```\nLactone (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one)   --->   Hydroxy Acid\n```\nOpening the ring gives a straight-chain acid with an alcohol group:\n`HO-C6-C5-C4(Et)-C3-C2-COOH`\n\nRenumbering this chain according to IUPAC rules for carboxylic acids (COOH is C1):\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`\n\nThe precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center in this acid is at C3. This C3 becomes the C4 in the lactone product. The stereochemistry at this center is not affected by the reduction or the subsequent cyclization.\n*   To form **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(R)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   To form **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(S)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials and the Transformation**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This name describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The `...pentanoic acid` suffix indicates a free carboxylic acid group at C1.\n\nStructure of the starting material:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-COO-isobutyl(5)`\n\nTo get from this starting material to the intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid), the following transformation must occur:\n`HOOC...-COO-isobutyl`  --> `HOOC...-CH2OH`\n\nThis means the **ester group** must be selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, while the **carboxylic acid group** remains unchanged. Since the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction, its configuration will be retained.\n\n**4. Correlate Starting Materials with Products**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-lactone\n    *   To get the (R)-lactone, we need the (R)-hydroxy acid intermediate.\n    *   To get the (R)-hydroxy acid, we must start with the (R)-acid-ester.\n    *   Therefore, **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   *Reagent Check*: LiBH4 is a reducing agent. When it reacts with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester, it first reacts with the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate (`-COO⁻`). This carboxylate is much less reactive towards reduction than the ester group. Thus, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the ester to a primary alcohol, which is consistent with the required transformation.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-lactone\n    *   To get the (S)-lactone, we need the (S)-hydroxy acid intermediate.\n    *   To get the (S)-hydroxy acid, we must start with the (S)-acid-ester.\n    *   Therefore, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   *Reagent Check*: BH3 is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. However, if that were the case here, it would lead to a different product (a 7-membered lactone). Given that the product is the 6-membered lactone, we must conclude that in this specific molecule, BH3 reduces the ester group. This unusual selectivity can be explained by an intramolecular reaction where the borane first coordinates to the carboxylic acid and then delivers a hydride to the ester carbonyl at the other end of the molecule. This leads to the required reduction of the ester group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the stereochemical outcome and the necessary chemical transformation:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe analysis of the chemical reactions and reagents leads to the following conclusions:\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are all derivatives of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid, specifically the mono-isobutyl ester. The full name is (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-isobutyl). The stereocenter is at carbon 3, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered cyclic ester (lactone). The stereocenter in the product is at carbon 4. This carbon corresponds to the stereocenter at carbon 3 of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly determines the stereochemistry of the product, as the reduction and cyclization reactions do not affect this chiral center.\n\n**Reaction A:**\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4). This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 reduces the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group remains largely unaffected.\n*   **Intermediate:** This reaction forms 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n*   **Final Step:** The intermediate hydroxy acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is **(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Since the reaction preserves the stereocenter, the starting material **A** must have the (R) configuration. Therefore, A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3). This reagent is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The isobutyl ester group remains intact.\n*   **Intermediate:** This reaction forms isobutyl 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n*   **Final Step:** This intermediate hydroxy ester undergoes an acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is **(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Since the reaction preserves the stereocenter, the starting material **B** must have the (S) configuration. Therefore, B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the known selectivity of the reducing agents and the conservation of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct starting materials:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures:** First, we need to understand the chemical structures of the product, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` (a delta-lactone), and the potential starting materials, which are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This starting material is a dicarboxylic acid derivative with both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group.\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Intermediate:** The formation of the lactone product requires a precursor molecule that has both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. We will determine the structure of this hydroxy acid intermediate.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (with LiBH4):** We will examine the selectivity of the reducing agent Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`). It selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. We'll see how this transforms the starting material **A** into the hydroxy acid intermediate and then the final (R)-lactone product, allowing us to deduce the stereochemistry of **A**.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (with BH3):** We will examine the selectivity of the reducing agent Borane (`BH3`). It selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. We'll see how this transforms the starting material **B** into a hydroxy-ester, which then cyclizes to the final (S)-lactone product. This will allow us to deduce the stereochemistry of **B**.\n5.  **Conclusion:** By combining the results from both reactions, we can identify the correct pair of starting materials from the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step solution to the stereochemistry problem\n    and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-Step Analysis:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze structures\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Product: (R/S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Let's draw its structure.\n    *   The backbone is a pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) derivative.\n    *   It has an ethyl group at C3: HOOC¹-CH₂²-C³H(Et)-CH₂⁴-C⁵OOH.\n    *   One of the carboxylic acids is esterified with isobutanol. The name \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\" indicates that the carboxylic acid at C5 is the one esterified.\n    *   Structure: HOOC¹-CH₂²-C³H(Et)-CH₂⁴-C⁵(=O)O-iBu.\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3.\n\n*   **Product (P):** The product is either (R)- or (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n    *   This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n    *   The \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" indicates a 6-membered ring with one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group at position 2 (next to the ring oxygen).\n    *   An ethyl group is at position 4.\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C4.\n    *   The formation of this lactone requires a molecule of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which then undergoes intramolecular esterification.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities for the substituents at the chiral centers.**\n\n*   **At C3 of the Starting Material:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    a) -H\n    b) -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n    c) -CH₂COOH (carboxyl group side)\n    d) -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu (ester group side)\n\n    To determine the priorities of (c) and (d), we look at the atoms attached to the carbon of the -CH₂- group. Both are carbons. We then look at what those carbons are attached to.\n    *   For -CH₂-**C**OOH: This carbon is attached to an -OH group and a =O group. Using the phantom atom method, this is equivalent to being attached to three oxygen atoms: (O, O, O).\n    *   For -CH₂-**C**(=O)O-iBu: This carbon is attached to an -O-iBu group and a =O group. The ether oxygen is attached to a carbon. So this is equivalent to being attached to (O, O, C).\n    *   Comparing (O, O, O) and (O, O, C), the first point of difference is the third atom. Oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon. Therefore, the -CH₂COOH group has higher priority than the -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu group.\n    *   The priority order at C3 is:\n        1.  -CH₂COOH\n        2.  -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃\n        4.  -H\n\n*   **At C4 of the Product:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral C4 are:\n    a) -H\n    b) -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n    c) -CH₂-C(=O)O- (the part of the ring leading to the carbonyl)\n    d) -CH₂-CH₂-O- (the part of the ring leading to the ether oxygen)\n\n    To determine the priorities of (c) and (d), we look at the atoms along each path.\n    *   Path (c): C4 -> C3 -> C2. The C2 atom is a carbonyl carbon, attached to two oxygens.\n    *   Path (d): C4 -> C5 -> C6. The C6 atom is a methylene carbon, attached to one oxygen.\n    *   Comparing the atoms attached to the second carbon in each chain (C2 vs C6), C2 (bonded to O, O) takes priority over C6 (bonded to O, H, H).\n    *   The priority order at C4 is:\n        1.  -CH₂-C(=O)O-\n        2.  -CH₂-CH₂-O-\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃\n        4.  -H\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters to alcohols but reacts very slowly with carboxylic acids. Thus, it will selectively reduce the isobutoxycarbonyl group.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu is reduced at the ester group to give 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH.\n    2.  The resulting hydroxy acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the product. The hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH) attacks the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction does not occur at the chiral center (C3).\n    *   Let's see how the substituents' priorities change.\n        *   The -CH₂COOH group (Priority 1 in SM) becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- group in the product ring (Priority 1 in P).\n        *   The -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu group (Priority 2 in SM) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂-CH₂-O- group in the product ring (Priority 2 in P).\n    *   Since the priority order of the substituents around the chiral center is preserved (1→1, 2→2, 3→3), the stereochemical configuration is **retained**.\n    *   To obtain an (R)-product, the starting material A must have an (R)-configuration.\n    *   Therefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** BH₃ (Borane) is a selective reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols much faster than it reduces esters. Thus, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu is reduced at the acid group to give isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu.\n    2.  The resulting hydroxy ester undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification (lactonization). The new hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction does not occur at the chiral center (C3).\n    *   Let's see how the substituents' priorities change.\n        *   The -CH₂COOH group (Priority 1 in SM) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂-CH₂-O- group in the product ring (Priority 2 in P).\n        *   The -CH₂C(=O)O-iBu group (Priority 2 in SM) becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- group in the product ring (Priority 1 in P).\n    *   The priorities of the two highest-ranked substituents are **swapped** (SM Priority 1 → P Priority 2; SM Priority 2 → P Priority 1).\n    *   When the priorities of two groups are swapped while their spatial arrangement remains the same, the R/S designation is **inverted**.\n    *   To obtain an (S)-product, the starting material B must have an (R)-configuration.\n    *   Therefore, **B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials A and B must be the same compound: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A and B):** The chemical name provided is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's break this down to understand its structure.\n    *   \"Pentanoic acid\": A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1).\n    *   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the third carbon (C3).\n    *   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\": This indicates that at the fifth carbon (C5), there is an ester group. Specifically, it's an isobutyl ester (-COOCH₂(CH₃)₂).\n    *   The structure is therefore a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid: `HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)`.\n    *   This molecule has a chiral center at C3, which can have either an (R) or (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\": This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group next to it (a δ-lactone).\n    *   \"4-ethyl\": An ethyl group is on the fourth carbon of the ring (numbering starts from the ring oxygen as 1, carbonyl carbon as 2).\n    *   The chiral center in the product is at C4.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe transformation from the starting material to the lactone product requires the reduction of one carbonyl group to an alcohol, followed by an intramolecular cyclization (lactonization). The key to solving this problem lies in the different chemoselectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\nThe chiral center in the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4). The chemical reactions (reduction and cyclization) occur at the ends of the molecule (C1 and C5) and do not involve breaking or forming any bonds at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R or S) of the starting material is retained in the product.\n\n*   An (R)-starting material will produce an (R)-lactone.\n*   An (S)-starting material will produce an (S)-lactone.\n\n### **3. Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a nucleophilic reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols. However, it is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids because the acidic proton is first removed to form a carboxylate anion (-COO⁻), which is electron-rich and repels the incoming nucleophilic hydride (BH₄⁻).\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the C1 carboxylic acid untouched.\n        `A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) --LiBH₄--> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes the intramolecular esterification between the C5-hydroxyl group and the C1-carboxylic acid, forming the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** The product of this reaction is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is an electrophilic reducing agent. It is exceptionally effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. While it can also reduce esters, its reaction with carboxylic acids is much faster. Thus, it selectively reduces the carboxylic acid in the presence of an ester.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the C5 isobutyl ester untouched.\n        `B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) --BH₃--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed C1-hydroxyl group attacks the C5-ester carbonyl, forming the same six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** The product of this reaction is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nAn analysis of the two reactions is required to determine the correct starting materials, A and B. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the selectivity of the two different reducing agents and tracing the stereochemistry from the starting material to the product.\n\n### **Analysis of the Product**\n\nBoth reactions yield a lactone (a cyclic ester) named 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, differing only in their stereochemistry at the C4 position. A tetrahydropyran-2-one is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group at the C2 position (a delta-lactone). This structure is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. In this specific case, the precursor must be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The stereocenter at C3 of this precursor becomes the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone product. The stereochemistry is retained during this cyclization.\n\n*   To form the **(R)**-lactone, the precursor must be **(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   To form the **(S)**-lactone, the precursor must be **(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This is a derivative of a five-carbon dicarboxylic acid (3-ethylglutaric acid) where the C1 is a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the C5 is an isobutyl ester (-COO-isobutyl). The stereocenter is at C3, which corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product.\n\nThe goal of each reaction is to convert the starting material into the corresponding 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid precursor, which then cyclizes. This requires the selective reduction of the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Transformation:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the C1 carboxylic acid untouched. This correctly forms the necessary (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid precursor from starting material A.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reaction does not affect the stereocenter, starting material **A must have the (R) configuration** to produce the (R)-lactone.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols, typically leaving esters unaffected under the same conditions.\n*   **Transformation:** Based on standard textbook selectivity, BH₃ would reduce the carboxylic acid at C1, not the ester at C5. This would result in a hydroxy-ester intermediate that cannot form the specified lactone product. This indicates a likely flaw in the premise of the question for this specific reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** However, to arrive at the specified (S)-lactone product, the reaction would need to proceed by reducing the ester group, just as in Reaction 1. Assuming the question intends for this outcome despite the incorrect choice of reagent, the stereochemistry would be preserved. Therefore, to produce the (S)-lactone, starting material **B must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the chemically sound analysis of Reaction 1 and the logical inference for the intended (though chemically inaccurate) Reaction 2, the stereochemistry of the starting materials can be determined:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the two reactions, paying close attention to the reagents and their known selectivities.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\nThe general structure of the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-isobutyl). The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This lactone is formed by reducing one of the two carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol, which then cyclizes by reacting with the remaining carbonyl group. The stereochemistry at the chiral center (C4 of the product, which was C3 in the starting material) is a key detail.\n\n**Reaction A:**\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄)\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group first reacts with LiBH₄ in an acid-base reaction to form a lithium carboxylate salt. This salt is resonance-stabilized and much less reactive towards reduction than the ester group. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The isobutyl ester of compound **A** is reduced to a primary alcohol, forming an intermediate hydroxy acid.\n    2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at C3. Thus, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃)\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** Borane (often used as a complex, like BH₃·THF) is well-known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid of compound **B** is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, forming an intermediate hydroxy ester.\n    2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), this hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to yield the lactone and isobutanol as a byproduct.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, the stereochemistry is preserved. Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the chemo-selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** must have the (R) configuration.\n*   Starting material **B** must have the (S) configuration.\n\nThis corresponds to the following selection:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe analysis of the search results confirms the initial reasoning.\n\n*   **Selectivity of BH3:** Borane (BH3) selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. This is a well-established principle in organic chemistry. The reaction proceeds through an acyloxyborane intermediate which is then further reduced.\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH4:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. While less common than NaBH4 or LiAlH4, its specific niche is this selective reduction of esters.\n*   **Reaction Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the carbonyl groups by these hydride reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) and the subsequent intramolecular cyclization (lactonization or transesterification) do not affect the configuration of the existing chiral center at C3 of the starting material's carbon chain.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly dictates the stereochemistry of the lactone product in both reactions.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n**Reaction A:**\n1.  **Reagent:** LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)\n2.  **Starting Material A:** (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n3.  **Action of LiBH4:** Selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact.\n    `A --(LiBH4)--> (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid + isobutanol`\n4.  **Cyclization:** The resulting hydroxy-acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) upon workup (H+).\n    `(R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid --(H+)--> (R/S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The stereocenter is retained throughout the process. Since the product is **(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, the starting material A must have been **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n1.  **Reagent:** BH3 (Borane)\n2.  **Starting Material B:** (R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n3.  **Action of BH3:** Selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n    `B --(BH3)--> Isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`\n4.  **Cyclization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification upon workup (H+).\n    `Isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate --(H+)--> (R/S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one + isobutanol`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The stereocenter is also retained in this reaction sequence. Since the product is **(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, the starting material B must have been **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nCombining these findings:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. Let's analyze its structure and how it's formed.\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** A saturated six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (position 1) and a carbonyl group (at position 2).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   **Stereocenter:** The carbon at position 4 is chiral because it's attached to four different groups (H, ethyl, -CH2C(=O)O-, and -CH2CH2O-).\n*   **Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. In this case, the precursor would be 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\nLet's trace the atoms from the open-chain precursor to the cyclic product:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\nThe hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the carboxylic acid group at C1 to form the six-membered ring.\n*   The stereocenter in the open-chain precursor is C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n*   During cyclization, C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone.\n*   Crucially, the reaction (cyclization) does not involve breaking any bonds at the stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R/S) of the starting material is retained in the product.\n    *   An (R)-precursor will form an (R)-lactone.\n    *   An (S)-precursor will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe proposed starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This name describes a molecule with a five-carbon chain, a carboxylic acid at one end (C1), and an isobutyl ester at the other end (C5). The ethyl group is at C3.\n*   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`\n*   This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has the same stereocenter at C3 as the lactone precursor.\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with known chemoselectivity:\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** A mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** A reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material A, which is an enantiomer of `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`, is treated with LiBH4.\n    2.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is left unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As established, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained throughout the process. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** `A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material B, the other enantiomer, is treated with BH3.\n    2.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-COO-iBu`) is left unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) to form the same lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** `B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product**\n\nBoth reactions yield a lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group (a delta-lactone). It has an oxygen atom at position 1 and a carbonyl group at position 2. The ring is saturated (\"tetrahydro\").\n*   **Substitution:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4.\n*   **Chirality:** Carbon 4 is a chiral center. The product of reaction 1 is the (R)-enantiomer, and the product of reaction 2 is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      O\n     //\n  C(2)---O(1)\n /       \\\nC(3)H2   C(6)H2\n|         |\nC(4)H----C(5)H2\n|\nCH2CH3\n```\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Transformation**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Structure:** This is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid). It has a free carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu) at the other end (C5). An ethyl group is at C3.\n*   **Chirality:** Carbon 3 is the chiral center in the starting material.\n\nThe overall transformation involves converting this dicarboxylic acid monoester into a lactone. A lactone is formed from a hydroxy-acid. Specifically, the product is a delta-lactone, which forms from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n\nThis means the starting material, `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`, must be converted into the intermediate `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid). This requires the selective reduction of the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) of the hydroxy-acid to form the final lactone product.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1: Reagent LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is strong enough to reduce the ester but generally does not react with the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Transformation:** LiBH₄ correctly performs the required transformation: it reduces the ester group at C5 to an alcohol, leading to the hydroxy-acid intermediate and then the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical reaction (reduction) occurs at C5, which is not the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration** at the chiral center. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules change for the substituents on the chiral center.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (C3):**\n        1.  `-CH₂-COO-iBu` (ester group has priority over acid group)\n        2.  `-CH₂-COOH`\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Priorities in Product (C4):** The chiral center C3 becomes C4. The groups transform as follows:\n        *   `-CH₂-COO-iBu` (Start Priority 1) → `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Product Priority 2)\n        *   `-CH₂-COOH` (Start Priority 2) → `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (Product Priority 1)\n        *   `-CH₂CH₃` (Start Priority 3) → `-CH₂CH₃` (Product Priority 3)\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereodescriptor:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. Due to this change in CIP priorities, the R/S descriptor will flip even though the spatial arrangement of the groups is retained. An (S) starting material will yield an (R) product, and an (R) starting material will yield an (S) product.\n\n*   **Final Deduction for A:** The product is the **(R)-lactone**. Since the reaction causes an S→R inversion of the name, the starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2: Reagent BH₃**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) typically reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters. However, in dicarboxylic acid monoesters like this one, a special mechanism called **anchimeric assistance** occurs. The BH₃ first reacts with the free carboxylic acid to form an acyloxyborane intermediate (`-COO-BH₂`). This borane group is then held close to the ester carbonyl, allowing it to deliver a hydride intramolecularly, reducing the ester. This intramolecular reaction is faster than the intermolecular reduction of a simple ester. Therefore, in this specific case, BH₃ also selectively reduces the ester group.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the same as with LiBH₄: the ester at C5 is reduced, leading to the lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction mechanism does not involve the chiral center C3, so it also proceeds with **retention of configuration**. The same change in CIP priorities occurs as in Reaction 1. Therefore, an (R) starting material will yield an (S) product.\n\n*   **Final Deduction for B:** The product is the **(S)-lactone**. Since the reaction causes an R→S inversion of the name, the starting material **B** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis problem requires understanding the specific reactivity of different reducing agents towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group, as well as tracking the stereochemistry of the reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures\n\n*   **Starting Material (A and B):** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this structure:\n    *   It's a five-carbon chain (pentanoic acid derivative).\n    *   It has a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at one end (C1).\n    *   It has an isobutyl ester group (`-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) at the other end (C5).\n    *   It has an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) at C3.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is a chiral center, meaning the starting material can exist as (R) or (S) enantiomers.\n\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n    *   This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone.\n    *   Lactones are formed by the intramolecular reaction of a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid (or ester) group. For a six-membered ring, this means a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid derivative must have cyclized.\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) is now C4 in the lactone product. Since the reactions do not involve breaking bonds at the chiral center, its configuration (R or S) will be retained.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1 and the Selectivity of LiBH₄\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 is left unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this intermediate to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at C5 and C1, not at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is retained. To produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2 and the Selectivity of BH₃\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a unique reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 is left unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center at C3 is not affected. The stereochemical configuration is retained. To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand the structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom is at position 1. This entire functional group, a cyclic ester, is called a **lactone**. Specifically, it's a delta-lactone because the oxygen is on the 5th carbon relative to the carbonyl carbon in the open-chain precursor.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   **(R)-** or **(S)-**: This refers to the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is a 6-membered lactone. This type of molecule is typically formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor must be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. Let's verify this:\nHOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)\nUpon acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification, the -OH group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1. The resulting lactone will have the ethyl group at position 4 (C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone), which matches the product name.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's decode this IUPAC name:\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This describes the substituent at C5. It means the C5 carbon is part of an isobutyl ester group (-C(=O)O-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n\nSo, the structure is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one carboxylic acid group is free (at C1) and the other (at C5) is esterified with isobutanol.\nStructure: **HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)**\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It also has a single chiral center at C3, the carbon with the ethyl group.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group at C5 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the final 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5, while the stereocenter is at C3. No bonds to the stereocenter are broken or formed, so its configuration is retained. To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must be the **(R)**-isomer.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, especially in the presence of less reactive esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to reaction A, the reactions occur at C1 and C5, and the stereocenter at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must be the **(S)**-isomer.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the two reactions and the selectivity of the reducing agents involved.\n\n**The Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The reactions produce (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester formed from a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an alcohol group. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of a dicarboxylic acid where one acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, which has the ethyl group.\n\n**Analyzing the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe formation of the lactone product requires one of the carbonyl groups in the starting material to be reduced to an alcohol, followed by cyclization (lactonization). The key to this problem lies in the different chemoselectivities of the two reducing agents, borane (BH₃) and lithium borohydride (LiBH₄).\n\n*   **Reaction with BH₃ (Borane):** Borane is well-known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids much more rapidly than esters. In the presence of both functional groups, BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Reaction with LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and is capable of reducing esters. Crucially, LiBH₄ is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Reaction 2 (Compound B + BH₃):**\n    *   Reagent: BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid.\n    *   Reaction: The -COOH group of compound B is reduced to a -CH₂OH group, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n    *   Intermediate: This forms a 5-hydroxy ester.\n    *   Cyclization: Under acidic workup (H⁺), the newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone.\n    *   Stereochemistry: This sequence of reactions (reduction and lactonization) does not affect the existing stereocenter at position 3 of the starting material, which becomes position 4 in the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material.\n    *   Conclusion: Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Reaction 1 (Compound A + LiBH₄):**\n    *   Reagent: LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester.\n    *   Reaction: The isobutyl ester group of compound A is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n    *   Intermediate: This forms a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    *   Cyclization: Under acidic workup (H⁺), the alcohol group attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl, eliminating water to form the lactone.\n    *   Stereochemistry: As in the first reaction, the stereocenter is not altered during this process. The stereochemistry of the starting material dictates the stereochemistry of the product.\n    *   Conclusion: Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nTo determine the proper starting materials, A and B, we must analyze the two reactions, paying close attention to the reagents and the stereochemistry of the products.\n\n### Analysis of the Starting Material and Products\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Its structure contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is at the C3 carbon, which has an ethyl group attached.\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a type of cyclic ester known as a lactone. The formation of this six-membered ring lactone occurs when a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes. The chiral center at C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone product. Crucially, the reduction and subsequent lactonization steps do not alter the configuration (R or S) of this chiral center. Therefore, an (R)-starting material will yield an (R)-product, and an (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The product is the (R)-enantiomer. This directly implies that the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent. While it can reduce both esters and carboxylic acids, it is known to be more selective for the reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. In this reaction, LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization (lactonization) of the resulting hydroxy acid to form the (R)-lactone.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The product is the (S)-enantiomer. This indicates that the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent well-known for its high chemoselectivity. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters. In this case, BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The resulting hydroxy-ester then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification (lactonization) to yield the (S)-lactone.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the stereochemistry of the products and the known selectivity of the reducing agents:\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)-enantiomer** to produce the (R)-lactone.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)-enantiomer** to produce the (S)-lactone.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze how each reducing agent reacts with the functional groups present and how this affects the stereochemistry of the final product.\n\nThe potential starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-CO-O-iBu). The molecule has a chiral center at carbon 3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\n### **Reaction A**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagents:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride), followed by H⁺ workup.\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (a lactone)\n\n**Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n\n**Reaction Pathway:**\n1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the resulting 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone product.\n\n**Stereochemical Analysis:**\n1.  **Assigning Priorities:** We must use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to assign priorities to the groups attached to the chiral center (carbon 3) in the starting material.\n    *   Groups on C3: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH (acid), and -CH₂COOiBu (ester).\n    *   Priorities: **1.** -CH₂COOiBu > **2.** -CH₂COOH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n2.  **Transformation Effect:** The reduction converts the ester group into a -CH₂CH₂OH group. The chiral center itself is not altered, but the priorities of its adjacent groups change.\n    *   In the intermediate hydroxy acid (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`), the priority order becomes: **1.** -CH₂COOH > **2.** -CH₂CH₂OH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n3.  **Configuration Change:** The group that was priority #1 in the starting material is now priority #2 in the intermediate, and the group that was #2 is now #1. This swap in the priority of two groups inverts the stereochemical designation (R/S). Therefore, an (S) starting material will become an (R) intermediate.\n4.  **Final Step:** The cyclization of the (R)-hydroxy acid to the (R)-lactone does not change the configuration at the chiral center.\n5.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the (R)-product, the starting material A must be the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\n### **Reaction B**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagents:** BH₃ (Borane), followed by H⁺ workup.\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n**Reaction Pathway:**\n1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the resulting 5-hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone product and isobutanol.\n\n**Stereochemical Analysis:**\n1.  **Assigning Priorities:** The priorities for the starting material B are the same as for A:\n    *   Priorities: **1.** -CH₂COOiBu > **2.** -CH₂COOH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n2.  **Transformation Effect:** The reduction converts the carboxylic acid group into a -CH₂CH₂OH group. Let's examine the priorities in the intermediate hydroxy ester (`HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`).\n    *   Priority order: **1.** -CH₂COOiBu > **2.** -CH₂CH₂OH > **3.** -CH₂CH₃ > **4.** -H.\n3.  **Configuration Change:** The group that was priority #1 (-CH₂COOiBu) remains priority #1. The group that was priority #2 (-CH₂COOH) is reduced but the new group (-CH₂CH₂OH) is still priority #2 relative to the ethyl group. The priority order of the substituents does not change. Therefore, the stereochemical designation (R/S) is retained. An (S) starting material will give an (S) intermediate.\n4.  **Final Step:** The cyclization of the (S)-hydroxy ester to the (S)-lactone does not change the configuration.\n5.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the (S)-product, the starting material B must be the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Product\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's deconstruct this name:\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**: This is a six-membered saturated ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring) and a ketone/carbonyl group at position 2. This structure is a cyclic ester, also known as a lactone. Specifically, it's a δ-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon-4 of the ring.\n*   **(R)- or (S)-**: This refers to the stereochemistry at the chiral center. In this molecule, the only chiral center is carbon-4, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n\nA lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. A six-membered δ-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor for our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\n\nUpon acid-catalyzed cyclization (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1, forming the six-membered lactone. The carbon atoms of the acid map to the lactone ring as follows:\n*   C1 (acid) → C2 (lactone carbonyl)\n*   C3 (acid, with ethyl group) → C4 (lactone, with ethyl group)\n\nThe key point is that the stereocenter at C3 of the acid becomes the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone, and this cyclization reaction **does not change the R/S configuration**.\n*   An (R)-hydroxy acid will produce an (R)-lactone.\n*   An (S)-hydroxy acid will produce an (S)-lactone.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Starting Materials\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This name describes a molecule with a five-carbon chain that has:\n*   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1).\n*   An isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) at the other end (C5).\n*   An ethyl group at C3, which is the chiral center.\n\nThe structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOiBu(5)`\n\nThis molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one acid group is free and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions\n\nWe need to convert the starting material, which has a carboxylic acid and an ester, into the product, a lactone. This involves selectively reducing one of the two carbonyl functional groups to an alcohol, which can then cyclize.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It does not reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n### Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction**: LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group (-COOiBu at C5) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH at C1) remains unchanged.\n    `A [HOOC-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-COOiBu] --(LiBH₄)--> HOOC-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n2.  **Intermediate**: The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n3.  **Lactonization**: The H⁺ workup protonates the intermediate and catalyzes the cyclization to form the lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry**: This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C3. To obtain the **(R)-lactone** product, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n5.  **Conclusion for A**: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction**: BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH at C1) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group (-COOiBu at C5) remains largely unchanged.\n    `B [HOOC-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-COOiBu] --(BH₃)--> HOCH₂-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-COOiBu`\n2.  **Intermediate**: The intermediate formed is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Lactonization**: The H⁺ workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the six-membered lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry**: This reaction sequence also does not affect the stereocenter. To obtain the **(S)-lactone** product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n5.  **Conclusion for B**: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere's a breakdown of the chemical reactions to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe final product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a lactone (a cyclic ester). Lactones are typically formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy acid. The specific hydroxy acid needed to form the product is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\nThe provided starting materials are all derivatives of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-iBu) at the other (C5).\n\nTo get the necessary hydroxy acid intermediate, one of these functional groups must be selectively reduced to an alcohol while the other remains a carboxylic acid. The stereocenter at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone product) is not affected by the reduction reactions. Therefore, the stereochemistry (R or S) of the starting material will directly correspond to the stereochemistry of the product.\n\nLet's examine the selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n\n**Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is well-known for its ability to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** LiBH₄ will reduce the ester group at the C5 position of starting material A to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched.\n    *   A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH\n*   The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent addition of acid (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since LiBH₄ is used to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have been **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃ (Borane)**\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a highly selective reducing agent that rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while typically being much less reactive towards esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** This presents a seeming contradiction, as reducing the carboxylic acid would initially yield a hydroxy-ester (HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu), which cannot directly cyclize into the required lactone. However, the reaction is followed by an acid workup (H⁺). This acidic step can serve a dual purpose: it not only catalyzes the lactonization but can also hydrolyze the isobutyl ester to a carboxylic acid. The most established and highly selective role of BH₃ is the reduction of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu) + BH₃ → HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu\n*   During the acid workup (H⁺), two things happen: the ester is hydrolyzed, and the resulting hydroxy acid cyclizes.\n    *   HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu + H⁺/H₂O → HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH + iBuOH\n    *   This hydroxy acid is *not* the correct one for the target lactone.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the BH₃ reaction. Given the options, there must be a viable pathway. An alternative interpretation is that BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to an alcohol, and the subsequent workup first hydrolyzes the ester at C5 to a carboxylic acid and *then* the lactone is formed. This would result in 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, the same intermediate as in the LiBH₄ reaction.\n\n*   **Revised Reaction B Pathway:**\n    1.  Reduction of COOH with BH₃: (S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu → (S)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu\n    2.  Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and lactonization: The hydroxy-ester is worked up with acid, leading to the hydrolysis of the ester and subsequent cyclization. The intermediate would be the same 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\nSince this pathway forms the lactone, we look at the stereochemistry. The reaction produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. As the stereocenter is unaffected, the starting material B must have been **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Starting Material A:** Reacts with LiBH₄ to form the (R)-lactone. Since LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester and stereochemistry is retained, A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Starting Material B:** Reacts with BH₃ to form the (S)-lactone. Since BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid and stereochemistry is retained, B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nMy thinking process to solve this problem involves breaking down the chemical reactions step-by-step, focusing on the selectivity of the reagents and the stereochemical outcomes.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structures:** First, I identify the structures of the starting material and the product.\n    *   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOCH2CH(CH3)2`) at the other (C5). It has a chiral center at C3, where an ethyl group is attached.\n    *   **Product:** `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). It has a chiral center at C4, where the ethyl group is attached. This C4 in the product corresponds to the C3 in the starting material.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-product`\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a specific reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters to alcohols but does not react with carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        1.  `LiBH4` reduces the isobutyl ester group on starting material A to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is left untouched. This forms a hydroxy-acid intermediate: `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n        2.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the alcohol group attacks the carboxylic acid group to form the six-membered ring of the product lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this process, the chemical bonds to the chiral center (C3 in the starting material, which becomes C4 in the product) are not broken. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with *retention of configuration*. To get the **(R)-product**, the starting material **A must be the (R)-enantiomer**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-product`\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (`BH3`) is another specific reducing agent, but it has the opposite selectivity of `LiBH4`. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        1.  `BH3` reduces the carboxylic acid group on starting material B to a primary alcohol. The ester group is left untouched. This forms a hydroxy-ester intermediate: `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n        2.  The acidic workup (`H+`) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`HOCH2CH(CH3)2`) and forming the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, the bonds to the chiral center are not affected. This reaction also proceeds with *retention of configuration*. To get the **(S)-product**, the starting material **B must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   From Reaction 1, we determined: **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   From Reaction 2, we determined: **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n5.  **Final Choice:** This combination corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes two chemical reactions to determine the correct starting materials.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the reactions:\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analysis of Reaction 1 ---\n    print(\"--- Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one ---\")\n    print(\"1.

Let's break down this name:\n    *   \"pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n    *   \"tetrahydro\" means the ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n    *   \"2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring.\n    *   This structure is a δ-lactone (a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring).\n    *   \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 4.\n    *   The numbering for the pyranone ring starts with the ring oxygen as position 1, and the carbonyl carbon as position 2.\n    *   The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, an ethyl group, a -CH₂-C=O group (part of the ring), and a -CH₂-CH₂-O- group (part of the ring).\n*   **Lactone Formation:** A δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The specific precursor for 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one must be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)-OH\n    *   When this molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxyl group at C1. The C3 of the acid chain (which has the ethyl group) becomes the C4 of the lactone ring. The stereochemistry at this carbon is preserved during lactonization.\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options provide isomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's determine its structure.\n    *   This name describes a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid is free and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5). The chiral center is at C3.\n    *   The goal of both reactions is to transform this starting material into 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which then cyclizes to the product lactone. This requires the selective reduction of the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (-COO-iBu) at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The H⁺ workup quenches the reaction and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the δ-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence does not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral C3 center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. The (R/S) configuration of the starting material A at C3 will be the same as the (R/S) configuration of the product lactone at C4.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a strong reducing agent. It is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Careful Point - The \"Trick\" in the Question:** If BH₃ followed its standard selectivity, it would reduce the -COOH group at C1 to -CH₂OH, leaving the ester at C5 intact. The resulting molecule (an ester of a 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid derivative) would cyclize to form a 7-membered lactone (an ε-lactone), not the 6-membered lactone (δ-lactone) specified in the product.\n*   **Correct Mechanism for this Substrate:** For dicarboxylic acid monoesters like glutaric acid derivatives, borane exhibits an unusual selectivity. The carboxylic acid first reacts with BH₃ to form an acyloxyborane intermediate (R-COO-BH₂). This intermediate then forms a stable six-membered ring by chelating with the carbonyl oxygen of the nearby ester group. This chelation activates the *ester* carbonyl, directing a second molecule of BH₃ to reduce the ester group instead of the acyloxyborane.\n*   **Mechanism Summary:**\n    1.  Despite the usual selectivity of BH₃, in this specific case, an intramolecular chelate directs the reduction to the ester group.\n    2.  The net result is the same as with LiBH₄: the ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol, and the carboxylic acid at C1 is preserved (regenerated during H⁺ workup).\n    3.  The intermediate is again 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  Lactonization under acidic conditions yields the δ-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This mechanism also does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Based on the analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n*   This corresponds to the option where:\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nLet's match this to the given options.\nOption D matches our findings.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Starting Material Structure**\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   Reaction A yields `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   Reaction B yields `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   These products are enantiomers of a delta-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester). The stereocenter is at carbon 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\n*   **Starting Materials:**\n    *   The options for starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Let's draw this structure. The parent chain is \"pentanoic acid\", so there is a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1. At C5, there is an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`). An ethyl group is at C3.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-isobutyl`.\n    *   This molecule is a dicarboxylic acid derivative (specifically, a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid). It has two reducible functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. The stereocenter is at C3.\n\n**2. Analyze the Lactone Formation Pathway**\n\nThe product is a six-membered lactone. This is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a C5-hydroxy carboxylic acid or a C5-hydroxy ester.\n\n*   The crucial point is how the stereocenter in the starting material relates to the stereocenter in the product.\n    *   Starting Material Chiral Center: C3 (`...-CH(Et)-...`)\n    *   Lactone Product Chiral Center: C4 (`...-CH(Et)-...`)\n*   The reduction reactions at C1 (carboxylic acid) or C5 (ester) do not involve the chiral center at C3. The subsequent cyclization also does not affect this center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained throughout the reaction sequence.\n*   This means an `(R)`-configured starting material will produce an `(R)`-configured lactone, and an `(S)`-configured starting material will produce an `(S)`-configured lactone.\n    *   `(R)-...starting material` --> `(R)-...lactone`\n    *   `(S)-...starting material` --> `(S)-...lactone`\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nWe need to consider the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH₄` and `BH₃`, towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagent is LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   **Reactivity:** `LiBH₄` is a reducing agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols much more readily than it reduces carboxylic acids. It is often used for the selective reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reaction Path:**\n        1.  `LiBH₄` selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` --(LiBH₄)--> `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        2.  The resulting intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n        3.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** Since Reaction A produces the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material `A` must have the `(R)` configuration.\n    *   **Therefore, A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagent is BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   **Reactivity:** `BH₃` (usually used as `BH₃·THF`) is a reducing agent renowned for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while being unreactive towards esters under the same conditions.\n    *   **Reaction Path:**\n        1.  `BH₃` selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` --(BH₃)--> `HOH₂C-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n        2.  The resulting intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n        3.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification of this hydroxy ester. The terminal hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) to form the six-membered lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** Since Reaction B produces the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material `B` must have the `(S)` configuration.\n    *   **Therefore, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the reagents' selectivity and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material `A` is `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   Starting material `B` is `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nBased on the principles of organic chemistry and the confirmed selectivity of the reducing agents, the following analysis determines the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe goal is to produce two different stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. Lactones are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of hydroxy acids. In this case, the precursor to the product is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes to form the δ-lactone. The reactions start with a dicarboxylic acid monoester, specifically a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The key to solving this problem lies in the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n1.  **Reaction A with LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group first reacts as an acid, getting deprotonated by the hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Compound A, which is (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid), has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid will remain untouched (after being deprotonated and then reprotonated during the acidic workup).\n    *   **Intermediate:** The reduction of the ester group in Compound A yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (cyclization) of the 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to form the δ-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical transformations do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Reaction B with BH₃ (Borane):**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Compound B, with the same functional groups, is treated with BH₃. The BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact. This initially forms a hydroxy ester. During the acidic workup (H⁺), the ester is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The reduction of the carboxylic acid group followed by hydrolysis of the ester in Compound B yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   **Lactonization:** As in the first reaction, this hydroxy acid then cyclizes under the acidic conditions to form the δ-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction sequence does not affect the chiral center. The configuration of the starting material is retained in the final product. To produce (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Summary**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** (R)-starting material + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone\n*   **Reaction B:** (S)-starting material + BH₃ → (S)-lactone\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, A and B, we must analyze the reactants and products of both reactions. Both reactions result in a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The key lies in the selectivity of the two different reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The proposed starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This name suggests a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one carboxylic acid has been converted to an isobutyl ester. This structure possesses two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu). It also has a single chiral center at the carbon with the ethyl group.\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is a six-membered lactone, which is formed from the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the functional groups (the acid and the ester), not at the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the ethyl-bearing carbon is retained throughout the reaction. An (R)-configured starting material will produce an (R)-configured product, and an (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is not reduced.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is unreacted (or exists as its lithium salt).\n    2.  Acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate to form 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  This hydroxy acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to form the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product has the (R) configuration and the stereocenter is not altered, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group is unaffected.\n    2.  The resulting molecule is a hydroxy-ester.\n    3.  This intermediate cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification (catalyzed by the acidic workup), eliminating isobutanol to form the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product has the (S) configuration and the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis, A is the (R)-isomer and B is the (S)-isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), and how they interact with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials.\n\nThe proposed starting materials are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-COO-isobutyl) at the other. The product in both reactions is a δ-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester), formed by the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups to an alcohol, followed by intramolecular cyclization. The stereocenter at the C4 position (bearing the ethyl group) of the lactone corresponds to the C3 position in the starting material. Crucially, this chiral center is not directly involved in the reduction or cyclization reactions, so its stereochemistry is expected to be retained from the starting material to the product.\n\n#### Reaction A: Starting Material A + LiBH₄ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. While it can reduce carboxylic acids, the reaction is much slower compared to the reduction of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** In this reaction, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group will remain largely unreacted. The resulting intermediate is (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** Following the reduction, an acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl at C1, forming the stable six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the stereocenter is retained, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n#### Reaction B: Starting Material B + BH₃ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH₃), typically used as a complex with THF or dimethyl sulfide, is a strong reducing agent that shows high selectivity for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, even in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will preferentially reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact. The intermediate formed is isobutyl (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Cyclization:** The acid workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol at one end of the molecule attacks the ester carbonyl at the other end, displacing isobutanol to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry at the C3 chiral center is preserved during this process. Therefore, to form the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nBased on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product of both reactions is a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break this down:\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring), which is saturated (tetrahydro) and has a carbonyl group (ketone, C=O) at the C-2 position. This specific structure is a delta-lactone. The ring atoms are O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)-.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center. The problem specifies the product of reaction 1 is the (R)-enantiomer and the product of reaction 2 is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Identify the Lactone Precursor**\n\nLactones are cyclic esters formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. To form the six-membered ring of the product, a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid is needed. Let's deduce the structure of the linear precursor:\n*   Breaking the ester bond in the lactone (between O-1 and C-2) and adding H2O conceptually gives a linear molecule.\n*   The O-1 gets an H to become an alcohol (-OH). The C-2 gets an OH to become a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   The linear chain is HOOC(C2)-C3-C4(Et)-C5-C6-(OH).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature for the acid, the carboxylic acid carbon is C1. So the structure is:\n    HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH.\n*   The name of this precursor is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n*   The chiral center in this acid is C-3. Upon cyclization, C-3 of the acid becomes C-4 of the lactone. Since the bonds to the chiral center are not broken during lactonization, the stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n    *   (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe options provided list the starting material as \"(R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This name describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\nThe structure is: **HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu** (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2).\nThis molecule has two functional groups that can be reduced:\n*   A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   An ester (-COOiBu)\nIt also has a chiral center at C-3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe two reducing agents have different selectivities:\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** A mild reducing agent that reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters, but it does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** A strong reducing agent that readily reduces carboxylic acids. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids much faster than esters, allowing for selective reduction.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material A (HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu) is treated with LiBH4.\n    2.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is left unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid).\n    4.  Under acidic workup (H+), this hydroxy-acid undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form the lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction converts the ester group to an alcohol, but it does not affect the chiral center at C-3. The stereochemistry is retained throughout the process.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the final product is the (R)-lactone, the intermediate must be the (R)-hydroxy-acid, which means the starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material B (HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu) is treated with BH3.\n    2.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group (-COOiBu) is initially unaffected due to the much faster reduction of the acid.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    4.  During the acidic workup (H+), the alcohol group on one end of the molecule attacks the ester carbonyl on the other end. This intramolecular transesterification reaction forms the stable six-membered lactone ring and displaces isobutanol (iBuOH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction pathway also does not involve breaking any bonds at the C-3 chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the final product is the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-ester must have the (S) configuration, which means the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B is the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nA) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure and Stereochemistry**\n\nThe product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of lactone (a cyclic ester). Let's break down its structure:\n*   **-pyran-**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom in the ring is position 1.\n*   **4-ethyl-**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n(6)C----C(5)\n |      |\n |    C(4)-CH2CH3\n |      |\n(2)C=O--C(3)\n```\n\nThis six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed by the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The linear precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**:\n\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n\nDuring cyclization, the -OH group from C5 attacks the carboxylic acid carbon (C1). The carbon that was C3 in the acid chain (the one with the ethyl group and the chiral center) becomes C4 in the lactone. The reaction (lactonization) does not affect the stereochemistry of this chiral center.\n\nTherefore:\n*   To produce **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(R)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   To produce **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the precursor must be **(S)**-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe starting materials given in the options are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's draw its structure. This is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one carboxylic acid group is a free acid and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\n(where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2)\n\nThe molecule has two carbonyl-containing functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOR). The chiral center is at C3, the same carbon that becomes the chiral center in the product.\n\n**3. Determine the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe key to this problem is understanding how the two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, react with a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) while leaving the carboxylic acid (-COOH) intact.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) while leaving the ester (-COOiBu) intact.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1 (Starting material A with LiBH4)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 will reduce the ester end of the starting material.\n    `A [HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu] ---(1) LiBH4---> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n*   The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The acidic workup (H+) causes this intermediate to cyclize to the lactone product.\n*   Since the final product is the **(R)**-lactone, the intermediate must be the **(R)**-hydroxy acid. As the reaction doesn't change the stereocenter, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2 (Starting material B with BH3)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid end of the starting material.\n    `B [HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu] ---(1) BH3---> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`\n*   The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   The acidic workup (H+) then causes an intramolecular transesterification (the -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl), displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the lactone product.\n*   Since the final product is the **(S)**-lactone, the intermediate must have the **(S)** configuration. As the reaction doesn't change the stereocenter, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of two different reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. The stereochemistry of the starting material and product must also be considered.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   **Starting Materials (A and B):** The options are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's break down this structure:\n        *   It is a derivative of pentanoic acid, which is a 5-carbon carboxylic acid.\n        *   At C3, there is an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`). This carbon is a chiral center.\n        *   At C5, there is an isobutyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂`).\n        *   The full structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group.\n    *   **Product:** The product in both reactions is \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\", a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center is at C4, which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material. Since the chemical reactions do not occur at the chiral center itself, the stereochemistry (R/S configuration) of this center will be retained from the starting material to the product.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagent Selectivity:**\n    *   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This is a moderately strong, nucleophilic reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It reacts with the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻`), which is resistant to further reduction by the nucleophilic hydride (BH₄⁻).\n    *   **Borane (BH₃):** This is a strong, electrophilic reducing agent. It has a very high preference for reducing carboxylic acids, reacting with them much faster than with esters.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  Since LiBH₄ is used, the **ester group** is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is not reduced.\n            `A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n        2.

The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry at the chiral center is also retained in this reaction. Therefore, to produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Final Determination:**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions yield a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**: This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring system). It is saturated (\"tetrahydro\") and has a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2, making it a lactone (specifically, a delta-lactone).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon-4 of the ring.\n*   **Chiral Center**: The carbon at position 4, which is bonded to the ethyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon atoms within the ring, is a chiral center.\n*   **(R) and (S)**: The prefixes indicate the stereochemical configuration at this C4 chiral center.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  H2C(6) C=O (2)\n   |    |\n  H2C(5) CH2(3)\n   \\   /\n    CH (4)\n    |\n    CH2CH3\n```\n*   **Reaction 1 Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2 Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options for the starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Pentanoic acid**: A 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group on carbon-3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that the carboxylic acid at the C5 position has been converted into an isobutyl ester (-COO-CH2CH(CH3)2).\n*   This molecule is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one acid group is free and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n  HOOC(1) — CH2(2) — CH(3) — CH2(4) — C(=O)(5) — O-isobutyl\n                       |\n                       CH2CH3\n```\n*   **Functional Groups**: It contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an ester (-COOR') at C5.\n*   **Chiral Center**: The carbon at position 3, bonded to the ethyl group, is the chiral center.\n*   The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) isomer of this molecule.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the selective reactivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)**: A relatively mild reducing agent. It readily reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. **It does not reduce carboxylic acids under normal conditions.**\n*   **BH3 (Borane)**: A powerful reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. While it can also reduce esters, the reaction with carboxylic acids is significantly faster. Therefore, it can be used to selectively reduce a carboxylic acid in the presence of an ester.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: In both reaction pathways, the chemical transformations (reduction and cyclization) occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and not at the chiral center (C3). This means the original stereochemistry of the C3 carbon is retained throughout the reaction. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product. Therefore:\n*   An (R)-starting material will yield an (R)-product.\n*   An (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n\n### **4. Applying the Logic to Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reduction**: `LiBH4` selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO(isobutyl)`  ---`LiBH4`--->  `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n2.  **Lactonization**: The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The product is the **(R)-lactone**. Since the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material **A** must have been the **(R)-isomer**.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Reduction**: `BH3` selectively reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester at C5 untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO(isobutyl)`  ---`BH3`--->  `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO(isobutyl)`\n2.  **Lactonization**: The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutyl alcohol to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The product is the **(S)-lactone**. Since the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material **B** must have been the **(S)-isomer**.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), and understand the subsequent cyclization reactions.\n\nThe potential starting materials are all isomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂). The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group remains largely unreacted.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of compound A to a primary alcohol. This creates a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The subsequent addition of acid (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification, known as lactonization, to form the stable six-membered ring lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The series of reactions (reduction and lactonization) does not affect the stereocenter at the carbon bearing the ethyl group. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A must be the same as the product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B: Reduction with BH₃\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that exhibits the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group of compound B to a primary alcohol, resulting in a 5-hydroxyester. The acidic workup (H⁺) then promotes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence also preserves the original stereocenter.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nCombining these findings, reactant A is the (R)-isomer and reactant B is the (S)-isomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of two different reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and Borane (BH₃), and how they affect the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n1.  **Starting Material Structure:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other has been converted to an isobutyl ester. The chiral center is at carbon 3, which has an ethyl group attached. The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n2.  **Reaction A:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:** In starting material A, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) untouched.\n    *   **Lactonization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) causes the molecule to undergo intramolecular esterification. The newly formed alcohol group attacks the carboxylic acid group, forming a stable six-membered cyclic ester, which is called a lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and lactonization reactions do not affect the chiral center at carbon 3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material. Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, starting material A must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n3.  **Reaction B:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:** In starting material B, BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the isobutyl ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) untouched.\n    *   **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol attacks the ester, displacing isobutanol and forming the same six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chemical transformations do not alter the existing stereocenter. The configuration of the product will match the configuration of the starting material. Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   To produce (R)-lactone with LiBH₄, the starting material **A** must be **(R)**.\n*   To produce (S)-lactone with BH₃, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe initial analysis was correct. Let's formalize the answer based on the confirmed selectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reagents:**\n    *   **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄):** The search results confirm that LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. While it is stronger than sodium borohydride, it is milder than lithium aluminum hydride and will not reduce a carboxylic acid functional group. The reaction of LiBH₄ with a dicarboxylic acid monoester results in the reduction of the ester group to an alcohol, which then allows for the formation of a lactone.\n    *   **Borane (BH₃):** The search results clearly state that borane (often as a THF or dimethyl sulfide complex) is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids over esters.\n\n*   **Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    1.  The starting material A is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid: (S)- or (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    2.  The reagent, LiBH₄, selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    3.  This creates a hydroxy acid intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylic acid, which then undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) with the newly formed hydroxyl group to yield the δ-lactone product.\n    5.  The chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material becomes the chiral center at the 4-position of the lactone. This center is not involved in the reduction or cyclization reactions, so its stereochemistry is retained.\n    6.  Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have been **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    1.  The starting material B is also a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid: (S)- or (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    2.  The reagent, BH₃, selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    3.  This creates a hydroxy ester intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) likely catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction, where the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone ring and displacing isobutanol.\n    5.  As in the first reaction, the stereocenter at the 3-position is unaffected and retains its configuration.\n    6.  Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have been **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
