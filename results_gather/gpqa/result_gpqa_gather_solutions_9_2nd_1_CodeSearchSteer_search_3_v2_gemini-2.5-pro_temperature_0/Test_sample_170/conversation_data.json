Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\nThe first step is to classify the substituents on the benzene ring based on their directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a relatively high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene): Activating\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): Activating\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho, para-directing\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid): Deactivating\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating\n\n**3. Initial Grouping**\nBased on this classification, the substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-isomer yields and must come first in the sequence, followed by the substances with ortho, para-directing groups.\nThe order will be: `{4, 6, 2}` < `{1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, leading to an even lower yield of the ortho and para products.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is generally accepted as: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest deactivators.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The `-COOC2H5` group is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` due to the weak electron-donating effect of the ethyl group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both have activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. This results in a higher para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating overall. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Literature data confirms that the para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene (typically ~87-90%) is higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Final Combined Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer, a step-by-step analysis of the substituent effects in electrophilic bromination is required.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This initial classification separates the substances into two groups: those that will produce a high yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a very low yield.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis grouping establishes that the final sequence must place substances 4, 6, and 2 before substances 1, 5, and 3.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more selectively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  **-NO₂ (4):** The nitro group is one of the most powerful deactivating groups due to strong inductive and resonance electron withdrawal. It will produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n2.  **-COOH (6) vs. -COOC₂H₅ (2):** Both are strongly deactivating. However, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is generally considered a stronger deactivator than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅). The electron-donating nature of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n3.  Therefore, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n4.  The order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n2.  **-Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating but directs ortho, para. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n3.  Combining these facts, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the ordered subgroups, we obtain the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\nComparing this result with the provided options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Substituents**: I will classify each of the six substituents on the benzene ring based on their directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. They will be categorized as either *meta-directors* or *ortho, para-directors*.\n2.  **Group the Substances**: Based on the classification, I will separate the substances into two groups: those that produce a very low yield of the para-isomer (meta-directors) and those that produce a high yield (ortho, para-directors). This establishes the broad structure of the final ordered list.\n3.  **Order the Meta-Directors**: Within the low-yield group, I will order the substances based on the strength of their deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer. The order of para-yield will be the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors**: Within the high-yield group, I will order the substances based on factors that influence the para-to-ortho product ratio, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects. Bulkier groups and certain electronic effects increase the proportion of the para-isomer.\n5.  **Combine and Finalize**: I will combine the two ordered groups to get the final sequence, from the lowest para-yield to the highest.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that assigns approximate para-yield percentages based on these chemical principles, sorts the substances accordingly, and prints the final ordered sequence to confirm the result.\n\n```python\ndef determine_para_isomer_yield_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the order of substances based on increasing yield of the para-isomer\n    in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define substances and classify them.\n    # We assign an approximate para-yield percentage based on chemical principles.\n    # The exact values can vary, but their relative order is what matters.\n    #\n    # Meta-directors (low para-yield):\n    # -NO2 is the strongest deactivator, so it has the lowest para-yield.\n    # -COOH is a stronger deactivator than -COOC2H5.\n    # So, para-yield order: -NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5\n    #\n    # Ortho, para-directors (high para-yield):\n    # -C2H5 is bulkier than -CH3, so it has a higher para-yield due to steric hindrance.\n    # -Cl is highly para-directing due to electronic effects, yielding more para-isomer than alkylbenzenes.\n    # So, para-yield order: -CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl\n\n    substances = {\n        1: {'name': 'Toluene', 'group': '-CH3', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 67},\n        2: {'name': 'Ethyl benzoate', 'group': '-COOC2H5', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 3},\n        3: {'name': 'Chlorobenzene', 'group': '-Cl', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 87},\n        4: {'name': 'Nitrobenzene', 'group': '-NO2', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 1},\n        5: {'name': 'Ethylbenzene', 'group': '-C2H5', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 75},\n        6: {'name': 'Benzoic acid', 'group': '-COOH', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 2}\n    }\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Sort the substances based on their para-isomer yield in increasing order.\n    sorted_substances = sorted(substances.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]['para_yield'])\n\n    # Step 5: Extract the numbers from the sorted list to get the final order.\n    final_order_numbers = [item[0] for item in sorted_substances]\n    final_order_string = '<'.join(map(str, final_order_numbers))\n\n    # The provided options\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"4<2<6<3<1<5\",\n        \"B\": \"4<6<2<1<5<3\",\n        \"C\": \"6<2<4<5<1<3\",\n        \"D\": \"3<5<1<6<2<4\"\n    }\n\n    # Find the correct option letter\n    correct_option_letter = \"Not Found\"\n    for letter, value in options.items():\n        if value == final_order_string:\n            correct_option_letter = letter\n            break\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of para-isomer yield:\")\n    print(\"1.

Since the molar mass of the monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same for any given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe substituent on the benzene ring determines where the incoming bromine atom will attach. We can classify the substituents into two main groups:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-director.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final sequence will have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest para yield) and the ortho,para-directors (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest para yield).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, thus producing an even smaller percentage of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The -NO₂ group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The -COOH group is slightly more deactivating than the -COOC₂H₅ group because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A bulkier substituent will block the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but highly para-directing. Its strong inductive effect (-I) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87-90%) is generally higher than for simple alkylbenzenes like toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these factors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n    *   **1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nWe now combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para yields, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n*   The complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 6: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\nThe derived order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\nLet's compare this with the options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe derived order matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This will determine whether the incoming bromine atom is directed to the meta position (low para-yield) or the ortho and para positions (high para-yield).\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Deactivating):** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene) - Activating\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene) - Activating\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene) - Deactivating, but o,p-directing\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order will have substances 4, 6, and 2 at the beginning (lowest yields) and substances 1, 5, and 3 at the end (highest yields).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group slightly counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is a special case. While it is deactivating, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with resonance, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene (typically ~87-90%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the orders from the two groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in electrophilic bromination, a step-by-step analysis based on chemical principles is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct, resulting in a very low yield.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nFrom this initial classification, we can conclude that the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-yields and will come first in the sequence, followed by the substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3).\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  The order of deactivating strength for these groups is well-established: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n2.  The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n3.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n4.  Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n\nThe correct order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n1.  **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n2.  **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. This is due to its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I), which deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor results in a very high para-to-ortho ratio, often making halobenzenes more para-selective than simple alkylbenzenes.\n\nCombining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the ordered subgroups, we place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, a careful step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This determines where the incoming bromine electrophile will preferentially add.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. As a result, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They produce a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but directs ortho, para.\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence will have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning, followed by the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3).\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is minimal. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n1.  The deactivating strength of these groups follows the order: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n2.  The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n3.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is slightly more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing effect.\n4.  Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n\nThe resulting order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n2.  **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric effects, results in a very high yield of the para-isomer, which is typically greater than that for alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\nThe resulting order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, with the meta-directors preceding the ortho, para-directors, we arrive at the final sequence.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, a careful step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director. This initial classification separates the substances into two distinct groups based on their expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, meaning the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitro group)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ester group)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer will be a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Methyl group)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chloro group)\n\nThis establishes that the final sequence must begin with substances 4, 6, and 2 (in some order) and end with substances 1, 5, and 3 (in some order).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer yield is inversely proportional to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n*   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The primary factor here is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor results in a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data confirms that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy concatenating the two ordered groups, we obtain the final sequence. The meta-directors have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match with the Given Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the provided choices:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe correct sequence, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho, para.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Broad Order**\nBased on this classification, the substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer and will appear first in the ordered list. The ortho, para-directors will have the highest yields and will appear last.\nThe overall order will be: `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor substances 4, 6, and 2, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (`-COOC2H5`) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating alkyl group (`-C2H5`) slightly mitigates the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of this deactivating strength.\n*   The correct order of increasing para-yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor substances 1, 5, and 3, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the ortho positions more effectively, making the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Therefore, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is an ortho, para-director that gives a very high yield of the para-isomer. This is due to a combination of its size and a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. Experimental data confirms that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a higher percentage of the para-isomer (typically ~87%) than both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the correct order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups to get the final sequence from lowest to highest para-isomer yield.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents on the benzene ring based on their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the substances into two main groups: those that will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a high yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position.

The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) slightly mitigates the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n*   The correct order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric effects, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the correct order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Chemical Principles**\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) to specific positions. Our goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the *para*-isomer. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the isomer, as all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material have the same molar mass.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nWe can divide the substituents into two main categories based on where they direct the incoming electrophile:\n1.  **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. They are deactivating and will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n2.  **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.

The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n    *   The `-NO₂` group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is a stronger deactivator than the `-COOC₂H₅` (ester) group because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing ability.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is the size (steric bulk) of the alkyl group. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is larger than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased bulk hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene will give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is highly para-directing. This is due to a combination of its size and its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I), which deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene (around 87%) is higher than for both toluene (around 67%) and ethylbenzene (which is higher than toluene but generally lower than chlorobenzene).\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n    *   **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the orders from Step 3 and Step 4, we get the final arrangement from lowest to highest para-isomer yield.\n*   (Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n*   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete, final order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Principles**\n\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe key factors determining the yield of the para-isomer are:\n*   **Directing Effect:** Substituents are either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*. Meta-directors will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho, para-directors will produce a high yield.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** For ortho, para-directors, a bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** For some groups (like halogens), electronic effects can also influence the ortho/para ratio.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent and group the substances accordingly.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low para-yield)**\n    These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position.

The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C6H5-**CH3** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C6H5-**C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C6H5-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial grouping tells us that the final order will be `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directors (Group 1)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is slightly less deactivating than -COOH due to the weak electron-donating nature of the ethyl group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance, results in a very high para-yield (typically ~87-90%), which is generally higher than that for alkylbenzenes like toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the complete order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**5. Combine the Orders for the Final Sequence**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most crucial step is to classify each substituent as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director. This separates the compounds into two distinct groups in terms of para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, meaning the para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning, followed by the ortho,para-directors (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group—a stronger deactivating group directs more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n*   The `-NO₂` group is one of the strongest deactivators, leading to the lowest para yield.\n*   The `-COOH` group is more deactivating than the `-COOC₂H₅` group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`) in substance 1. This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) in substance 3 is strongly ortho,para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~87-90%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing our derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield, a step-by-step analysis of the substituent effects in electrophilic bromination is required.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to categorize the substituents on the benzene ring as either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*. This initial classification separates the substances into two groups: those that will produce a high yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a very low yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, meaning the para-isomer is only a minor byproduct.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nFrom this classification, we know the final sequence must place substances 4, 6, and 2 before substances 1, 5, and 3.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor the meta-directors (4, 6, 2), the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The accepted order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   The -NO₂ group is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n*   The -COOH group is strongly deactivating.\n*   The -COOC₂H₅ (ester) group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) slightly mitigates the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n*   The correct order of increasing para-yield is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3), the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho products. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 and 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃) in substance 1. This increased size creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with Halogen (3):** The chlorine atom in substance 3 is deactivating but ortho, para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I effect) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~87-89%) is typically higher than for toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   The correct order of increasing para-yield is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we establish the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n*   The complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the substances into two main groups: those that will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a high yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will appear first in the ordered sequence.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. These substances will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substances 1, 5, and 3 will have the highest para-isomer yields and will appear last in the ordered sequence.\n\nThe final order will be of the form: `{4, 6, 2 in order} < {1, 5, 3 in order}`.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the small amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially offsets the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n*   **Order of increasing para-yield:** Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    *   This gives the sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the less-crowded para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. This is due to a combination of its size and a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (e.g., ~87% in bromination) is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) and also higher than for ethylbenzene.\n    *   This gives the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the ordered subgroups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine the final answer, a systematic analysis of the chemical principles governing electrophilic aromatic substitution is required. The task is to arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material is identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most important step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This determines whether the incoming bromine atom is directed primarily to the meta position (resulting in a low para-yield) or to the ortho and para positions (resulting in a high para-yield).\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with substances 4, 6, and 2, and end with substances 1, 5, and 3.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group directs more selectively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups due to strong inductive and resonance electron withdrawal.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is slightly more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃) in substance 1. This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) in substance 3 is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, with the low-yield meta-directors preceding the high-yield ortho,para-directors, we arrive at the final sequence.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\nThe first step is to classify the substituents on the benzene ring based on their directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a relatively high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Toluene): Activating\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): Activating\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho, para-directing\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid): Deactivating\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating\n\n**3. Initial Grouping**\nBased on this classification, the substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-isomer yields and must come first in the sequence, followed by the substances with ortho, para-directing groups.\nThe order will be: `{4, 6, 2}` < `{1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, leading to an even lower yield of the ortho and para products.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is generally accepted as: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest deactivators.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The `-COOC2H5` group is slightly less deactivating than `-COOH` due to the weak electron-donating effect of the ethyl group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both have activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. This results in a higher para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom is an ortho, para-director but is deactivating overall. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Literature data confirms that the para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene (typically ~87-90%) is higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Final Combined Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer, a step-by-step analysis of the substituent effects in electrophilic bromination is required.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This initial classification separates the substances into two groups: those that will produce a high yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a very low yield.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Isomer Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis grouping establishes that the final sequence must place substances 4, 6, and 2 before substances 1, 5, and 3.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more selectively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  **-NO₂ (4):** The nitro group is one of the most powerful deactivating groups due to strong inductive and resonance electron withdrawal. It will produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n2.  **-COOH (6) vs. -COOC₂H₅ (2):** Both are strongly deactivating. However, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is generally considered a stronger deactivator than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅). The electron-donating nature of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n3.  Therefore, the order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n4.  The order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n2.  **-Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating but directs ortho, para. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n3.  Combining these facts, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the ordered subgroups, we obtain the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\nComparing this result with the provided options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Substituents**: I will classify each of the six substituents on the benzene ring based on their directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. They will be categorized as either *meta-directors* or *ortho, para-directors*.\n2.  **Group the Substances**: Based on the classification, I will separate the substances into two groups: those that produce a very low yield of the para-isomer (meta-directors) and those that produce a high yield (ortho, para-directors). This establishes the broad structure of the final ordered list.\n3.  **Order the Meta-Directors**: Within the low-yield group, I will order the substances based on the strength of their deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer. The order of para-yield will be the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors**: Within the high-yield group, I will order the substances based on factors that influence the para-to-ortho product ratio, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects. Bulkier groups and certain electronic effects increase the proportion of the para-isomer.\n5.  **Combine and Finalize**: I will combine the two ordered groups to get the final sequence, from the lowest para-yield to the highest.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that assigns approximate para-yield percentages based on these chemical principles, sorts the substances accordingly, and prints the final ordered sequence to confirm the result.\n\n```python\ndef determine_para_isomer_yield_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the order of substances based on increasing yield of the para-isomer\n    in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define substances and classify them.\n    # We assign an approximate para-yield percentage based on chemical principles.\n    # The exact values can vary, but their relative order is what matters.\n    #\n    # Meta-directors (low para-yield):\n    # -NO2 is the strongest deactivator, so it has the lowest para-yield.\n    # -COOH is a stronger deactivator than -COOC2H5.\n    # So, para-yield order: -NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5\n    #\n    # Ortho, para-directors (high para-yield):\n    # -C2H5 is bulkier than -CH3, so it has a higher para-yield due to steric hindrance.\n    # -Cl is highly para-directing due to electronic effects, yielding more para-isomer than alkylbenzenes.\n    # So, para-yield order: -CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl\n\n    substances = {\n        1: {'name': 'Toluene', 'group': '-CH3', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 67},\n        2: {'name': 'Ethyl benzoate', 'group': '-COOC2H5', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 3},\n        3: {'name': 'Chlorobenzene', 'group': '-Cl', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 87},\n        4: {'name': 'Nitrobenzene', 'group': '-NO2', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 1},\n        5: {'name': 'Ethylbenzene', 'group': '-C2H5', 'type': 'o,p-director', 'para_yield': 75},\n        6: {'name': 'Benzoic acid', 'group': '-COOH', 'type': 'm-director', 'para_yield': 2}\n    }\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Sort the substances based on their para-isomer yield in increasing order.\n    sorted_substances = sorted(substances.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]['para_yield'])\n\n    # Step 5: Extract the numbers from the sorted list to get the final order.\n    final_order_numbers = [item[0] for item in sorted_substances]\n    final_order_string = '<'.join(map(str, final_order_numbers))\n\n    # The provided options\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"4<2<6<3<1<5\",\n        \"B\": \"4<6<2<1<5<3\",\n        \"C\": \"6<2<4<5<1<3\",\n        \"D\": \"3<5<1<6<2<4\"\n    }\n\n    # Find the correct option letter\n    correct_option_letter = \"Not Found\"\n    for letter, value in options.items():\n        if value == final_order_string:\n            correct_option_letter = letter\n            break\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of para-isomer yield:\")\n    print(\"1.

Since the molar mass of the monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same for any given starting material, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe substituent on the benzene ring determines where the incoming bromine atom will attach. We can classify the substituents into two main groups:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-director.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final sequence will have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest para yield) and the ortho,para-directors (1, 5, 3) at the end (highest para yield).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, thus producing an even smaller percentage of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The -NO₂ group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The -COOH group is slightly more deactivating than the -COOC₂H₅ group because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A bulkier substituent will block the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is deactivating but highly para-directing. Its strong inductive effect (-I) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87-90%) is generally higher than for simple alkylbenzenes like toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these factors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n    *   **1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nWe now combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para yields, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n*   The complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 6: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\nThe derived order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\nLet's compare this with the options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe derived order matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This will determine whether the incoming bromine atom is directed to the meta position (low para-yield) or the ortho and para positions (high para-yield).\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (Deactivating):** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene) - Activating\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene) - Activating\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene) - Deactivating, but o,p-directing\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order will have substances 4, 6, and 2 at the beginning (lowest yields) and substances 1, 5, and 3 at the end (highest yields).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group slightly counteracts the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is a special case. While it is deactivating, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with resonance, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene (typically ~87-90%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the orders from the two groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in electrophilic bromination, a step-by-step analysis based on chemical principles is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor byproduct, resulting in a very low yield.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nFrom this initial classification, we can conclude that the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-yields and will come first in the sequence, followed by the substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3).\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, leading to an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  The order of deactivating strength for these groups is well-established: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n2.  The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n3.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n4.  Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n\nThe correct order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n1.  **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n2.  **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. This is due to its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I), which deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor results in a very high para-to-ortho ratio, often making halobenzenes more para-selective than simple alkylbenzenes.\n\nCombining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the ordered subgroups, we place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, a careful step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This determines where the incoming bromine electrophile will preferentially add.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. As a result, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They produce a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but directs ortho, para.\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence will have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning, followed by the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3).\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer yield is minimal. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; a stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n\n1.  The deactivating strength of these groups follows the order: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n2.  The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n3.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is slightly more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing effect.\n4.  Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n\nThe resulting order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n2.  **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric effects, results in a very high yield of the para-isomer, which is typically greater than that for alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\nThe resulting order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, with the meta-directors preceding the ortho, para-directors, we arrive at the final sequence.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, a careful step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director. This initial classification separates the substances into two distinct groups based on their expected para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, meaning the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitro group)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ester group)\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer will be a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Methyl group)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chloro group)\n\nThis establishes that the final sequence must begin with substances 4, 6, and 2 (in some order) and end with substances 1, 5, and 3 (in some order).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer yield is inversely proportional to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n*   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The primary factor here is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more likely site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor results in a very high preference for para substitution. Experimental data confirms that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy concatenating the two ordered groups, we obtain the final sequence. The meta-directors have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match with the Given Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the provided choices:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe correct sequence, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.

The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the ortho positions more effectively, making the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Therefore, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is an ortho, para-director that gives a very high yield of the para-isomer. This is due to a combination of its size and a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. Experimental data confirms that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a higher percentage of the para-isomer (typically ~87%) than both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the correct order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups to get the final sequence from lowest to highest para-isomer yield.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nCombining them gives the final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents on the benzene ring based on their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution.

This electronic factor, combined with steric effects, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (typically ~87%) is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the correct order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Chemical Principles**\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) to specific positions. Our goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the *para*-isomer. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the isomer, as all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material have the same molar mass.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nWe can divide the substituents into two main categories based on where they direct the incoming electrophile:\n1.  **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. They are deactivating and will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n2.  **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a much higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final sequence must have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) first, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n    *   The `-NO₂` group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The `-COOH` group is a stronger deactivator than the `-COOC₂H₅` (ester) group because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing ability.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The primary difference is the size (steric bulk) of the alkyl group. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is larger than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased bulk hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene will give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (`-Cl`) is highly para-directing. This is due to a combination of its size and its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I), which deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene (around 87%) is higher than for both toluene (around 67%) and ethylbenzene (which is higher than toluene but generally lower than chlorobenzene).\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n    *   **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the orders from Step 3 and Step 4, we get the final arrangement from lowest to highest para-isomer yield.\n*   (Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n*   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete, final order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Principles**\n\nThe question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the molar percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe key factors determining the yield of the para-isomer are:\n*   **Directing Effect:** Substituents are either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*. Meta-directors will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho, para-directors will produce a high yield.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** For ortho, para-directors, a bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** For some groups (like halogens), electronic effects can also influence the ortho/para ratio.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent and group the substances accordingly.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low para-yield)**\n    These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C6H5-**NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C6H5-**COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C6H5-**COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C6H5-**CH3** (Toluene)\n    *   5) C6H5-**C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C6H5-**Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial grouping tells us that the final order will be `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directors (Group 1)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is slightly less deactivating than -COOH due to the weak electron-donating nature of the ethyl group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group 2)**\n\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene has a higher para-yield than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance, results in a very high para-yield (typically ~87-90%), which is generally higher than that for alkylbenzenes like toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the complete order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**5. Combine the Orders for the Final Sequence**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molar mass of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first and most crucial step is to classify each substituent as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director. This separates the compounds into two distinct groups in terms of para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, meaning the para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning, followed by the ortho,para-directors (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer yield is very low. The yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group—a stronger deactivating group directs more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower para yield.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n*   The `-NO₂` group is one of the strongest deactivators, leading to the lowest para yield.\n*   The `-COOH` group is more deactivating than the `-COOC₂H₅` group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield Group)**\nFor these compounds, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`) in substance 1. This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming bromine. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) will have a higher para-isomer yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) in substance 3 is strongly ortho,para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~87-90%) is typically higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho,para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Provided Options**\nComparing our derived sequence with the given choices:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield, a step-by-step analysis of the substituent effects in electrophilic bromination is required.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to categorize the substituents on the benzene ring as either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*. This initial classification separates the substances into two groups: those that will produce a high yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a very low yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, meaning the para-isomer is only a minor byproduct.\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nFrom this classification, we know the final sequence must place substances 4, 6, and 2 before substances 1, 5, and 3.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nFor the meta-directors (4, 6, 2), the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The accepted order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   The -NO₂ group is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n*   The -COOH group is strongly deactivating.\n*   The -COOC₂H₅ (ester) group is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) slightly mitigates the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n*   The correct order of increasing para-yield is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\nFor the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3), the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho products. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 and 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) in substance 5 is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃) in substance 1. This increased size creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with Halogen (3):** The chlorine atom in substance 3 is deactivating but ortho, para-directing. Its strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I effect) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric considerations, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (~87-89%) is typically higher than for toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n*   The correct order of increasing para-yield is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we establish the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n*   The complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nThe first step is to classify each substituent on the benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This allows us to separate the substances into two main groups: those that will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a high yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will appear first in the ordered sequence.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. These substances will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substances 1, 5, and 3 will have the highest para-isomer yields and will appear last in the ordered sequence.\n\nThe final order will be of the form: `{4, 6, 2 in order} < {1, 5, 3 in order}`.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the small amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group partially offsets the electron withdrawal.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n*   **Order of increasing para-yield:** Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    *   This gives the sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the less-crowded para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. This is due to a combination of its size and a strong, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) that deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. Experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene (e.g., ~87% in bromination) is significantly higher than for toluene (~67%) and also higher than for ethylbenzene.\n    *   This gives the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the ordered subgroups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
