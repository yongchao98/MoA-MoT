The most important piece of information here for this specific question is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:** A core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding angular momenta. This is expressed by the selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This means that a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can only be composed of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency (The Careful Point):** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Comparing the two values, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.

The desired final state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the same operator but with a different eigenvalue, $-2\\hbar$. Since eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are orthogonal, the projection of the initial state onto the final state is zero.

The most crucial piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Principle:** In the addition of angular momentum, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    For a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual measured quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal the total quantum number ($m$) of the system's initial state.\n\n4.  **Verify the Condition:** We must check if the selection rule is satisfied for the desired outcome.\n    *   From the initial state, we have: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired measurement outcome, we have: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing the two values, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The desired measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is a superposition of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ for which the sum $m_1 + m_2$ is always equal to -1. The state corresponding to the desired measurement, $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$, is not a component of this superposition. Therefore, the two states are orthogonal, and the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is set up to test the understanding of the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l, m>$) and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2>$).\n*   **The Selection Rule:** The core of the problem lies in recognizing and applying the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. This is a direct consequence of the operator identity $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n*   **Probability and Orthogonality:** A zero probability implies that the initial state and the final state (corresponding to the measurement outcome) are orthogonal. This occurs here because they are eigenstates of the same operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively).\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified the physical reasoning leading to a probability of 0. The discrepancies were only in mapping this result to the correct letter option. The correct option for a probability of 0 is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties:**\n    The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The most important quantum number for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, `m = -1`. This value represents the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the system. The state is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Final State:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired measurement outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    For a transition or measurement to have a non-zero probability, this condition must be met. The initial state $|l, m\\rangle$ is a superposition of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, but it only contains components for which the sum $m_1 + m_2$ equals the total $m$.\n\n4.  **Check the Condition and Conclude:**\n    Let's check if the selection rule is satisfied for this problem.\n    *   From the initial state: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the selection rule is violated. This means the initial state and the desired final state are orthogonal. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these two states is zero.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is the square of the magnitude of the inner product (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) between the initial and final states. Since this coefficient is zero, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_angular_momentum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the joint probability based on the conservation of angular momentum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers from the problem statement.\n    # The initial coupled state is |l, m> = |2, -1>.\n    # The total magnetic quantum number of the system is m.\n    m_initial = -1\n\n    # The measurement is for the eigenvalues of L_1z and L_2z to both be -ħ.\n    # This corresponds to measuring m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.\n    m1_measured = -1\n    m2_measured = -1\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the selection rule for the addition of angular momentum.\n    # The probability is non-zero only if m_initial = m1_measured + m2_measured.\n    m_sum_measured = m1_measured + m2_measured\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the probability based on the selection rule.\n    # If the rule is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and so is the probability.\n    if m_initial == m_sum_measured:\n        # This case would require calculating the actual Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n        # It does not apply to this specific problem.\n        probability = \"Non-zero, requires further calculation\"\n    else:\n        probability = 0\n\n    # Step 4: Match the result to the given options.\n    options = {'A': 2/3, 'B': 1/2, 'C': 0, 'D': 1}\n    final_choice = None\n    for choice, value in options.items():\n        # Use a small tolerance for floating point comparison if needed,\n        # but it's not necessary for an integer result like 0.\n        if probability == value:\n            final_choice = choice\n            break\n\n    # Step 5: Print the reasoning and the final answer.\n    print(f\"Initial state's total magnetic quantum number: m = {m_initial}\")\n    print(f\"Desired measurement outcome: m1 = {m1_measured}, m2 = {m2_measured}\")\n    print(f\"Sum of measured magnetic quantum numbers: m1 + m2 = {m_sum_measured}\")\n    print(\"\\nSelection Rule: The probability is non-zero only if m = m1 + m2.\")\n    print(f\"Checking the rule: Is {m_initial} == {m_sum_measured}? {m_initial == m_sum_measured}.\")\n    print(\"Since the rule is violated, the probability of this measurement is 0.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated probability is {probability}, which corresponds to option {final_choice}.\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: {final_choice}\")\n\nsolve_angular_momentum_problem()\n```\n\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Initial state's total magnetic quantum number: m = -1\nDesired measurement outcome: m1 = -1, m2 = -1\nSum of measured magnetic quantum numbers: m1 + m2 = -2\n\nSelection Rule: The probability is non-zero only if m = m1 + m2.\nChecking the rule: Is -1 == -2?

The system is in a *coupled* angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    The crucial information from this state is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ implies the magnetic quantum number for the first electron is **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ implies the magnetic quantum number for the second electron is **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This corresponds to finding the system in the *uncoupled* state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Careful Point):**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    For a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual measured magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the system's initial state.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    Let's check if the selection rule is satisfied for this problem.\n    *   From the initial state: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    Comparing the two values, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:**\n    Because the selection rule is violated, the transition from the initial state to the desired final state is forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum. Formally, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these two states, $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$, is zero.

The most important quantum numbers for this problem are the total magnetic quantum number, `m = -1`, and the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Final State:** A measurement is made of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`. The question asks for the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of `L₁z` is `-ħ`, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of `L₂z` is `-ħ`, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\n    This desired final state is an uncoupled state characterized by `(m₁, m₂) = (-1, -1)`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:** The core principle governing the relationship between the coupled and uncoupled bases is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The operator for the total z-component, `L_z`, is the sum of the individual components: `L_z = L₁z + L₂z`. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency (The Careful Point):** We must check if the desired final state is consistent with the initial state according to this selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, we have `m = -1`.\n    *   From the desired final state `(m₁, m₂) = (-1, -1)`, the sum is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We compare the total `m` from the initial state with the sum from the desired final state:\n    `m = -1`\n    `m₁ + m₂ = -2`\n    Since `m ≠ m₁ + m₂`, the selection rule is violated.

The probability of a measurement is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient. Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is `|0|² = 0`.\n\nThe event is physically impossible because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Initial State and its Properties\nThe system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state given by `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\nThe most critical pieces of information from this state are:\n*   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 2`.\n*   The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum is `m = -1`.\n\nThis means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, `Lz = L₁z + L₂z`, with a definite eigenvalue of `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Measurement and the Desired Final State\nA measurement is made of the individual z-components of angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`. We want to find the joint probability of a specific outcome:\n*   The eigenvalue of `L₁z` is `-ħ`. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n*   The eigenvalue of `L₂z` is `-ħ`. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\n\nThe final state we are testing for is the uncoupled state described by `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Conservation Principle\nA core principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nFor a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual measured quantum numbers (`m₁` and `m₂`) must equal the total quantum number (`m`) of the system's initial state.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Consistency\nLet's check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n*   From the initial state, we have `m = -1`.\n*   From the desired final state, we have `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n*   The sum for the final state is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\nNow, we compare the required sum with the system's actual value:\nIs `m = m₁ + m₂`?\nIs `-1 = -2`?\n\nThe condition is not met. The value `-1` is not equal to `-2`.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\nBecause the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a forbidden transition. The initial state `|l=2, m=-1>` is orthogonal to the final state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>`. The probability of measuring an outcome that is impossible is exactly zero.\n\nThe probability is formally given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `|<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|²`.

A coupled state $|l, m>$ can only be formed by a superposition of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number. The probability of finding the system in an uncoupled state that violates this rule is zero.\n\n4.  **Check the Condition for the Given Problem:**\n    We must check if the selection rule is satisfied.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have the total magnetic quantum number **$m = -1$**.\n    *   From the desired final state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers **$m_1 = -1$** and **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    *   The sum for the final state is: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Now, we compare the initial state's total $m$ with the sum from the final state:\n    Is $m = m_1 + m_2$?\n    Is $-1 = -2$?\n    The condition is **not** satisfied.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, the transition from the initial state to the desired final state is forbidden.

The initial state is given in the *coupled basis* as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    The most important piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    A measurement is made on the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.

The probability of measuring this outcome is exactly 0.\n    Formally, the probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$. This coefficient is zero because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met. Therefore, the probability is $|0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is set up with the initial state in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement outcome in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The key is understanding the relationship between them.\n*   **Conservation of $L_z$ is a Strict Rule:** The initial state has a definite value for the total z-component of angular momentum ($m=-1$). This is not an average value; it's a precise quantum number. Any measurement of the individual components *must* yield values ($m_1, m_2$) that sum to this total.\n*   **Correctly Identifying Quantum Numbers:** It is crucial to correctly extract $m=-1$ from the initial state ket $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ and to correctly calculate the sum $m_1+m_2 = -2$ from the desired measurement outcome.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated probability is 0.

The system is in the *coupled* angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The crucial information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Final State:** A measurement is made of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the joint probability of getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for both measurements.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the desired final state after the measurement is the *uncoupled* state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired final state is consistent with the initial state according to this conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) is not equal to the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state ($m_1+m_2=-2$). Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, the transition from the initial state to this specific final state is forbidden. The probability of such an event is zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) where the total angular momentum is well-defined, and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$) where the individual components are well-defined. The connection between these bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The Selection Rule:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a strict selection rule. If it is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial and final states is exactly zero.\n*   **Probability:** The probability of a measurement outcome is the square of the magnitude of the probability amplitude (in this case, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient). Since the coefficient is zero, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** The conservation of the z-component of angular momentum means that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is a superposition of only those uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ for which $m_1+m_2 = -1$. The state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is not part of this superposition, so it cannot be found upon measurement.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly identified this core reasoning.

The correct probability is 0, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the key concepts and careful points.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\n*   **System:** Two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. So, we have $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in a *coupled* angular momentum state, given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The total magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the angular momentum is $m=-1$. This is a crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n*   **Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe central principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the **conservation of the z-component of angular momentum**. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis operator relationship leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThis rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be formed by a superposition of uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) equals $m$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Principle to the Specifics of the Problem\n\n1.  **From the initial state** $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number of the system is precisely **$m = -1$**.\n2.  **For the desired measurement outcome**, we need $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n3.  **Check for consistency** by calculating the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the desired outcome:\n    $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n### Step 4: Draw the Conclusion\n\nWe compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the desired final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$).\n\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nIn the language of quantum mechanics, the probability of this measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is exactly zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is $P = |0|^2 = 0$. The event is impossible.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem\nThe core of the problem is to find the probability of a specific measurement outcome on a quantum system that is in a known initial state.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system of two electrons is in a *coupled* angular momentum state, given by `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l₁ = 1`, `l₂ = 1`: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers (p-orbitals).\n    *   `l = 2`: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   `m = -1`: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n*   **Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L₁z` as `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L₂z` as `-ħ`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of `L_z` is `m_l * ħ`. Therefore, an eigenvalue of `-ħ` corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of `-1`.\n    *   This means the desired final state has `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Governing Physical Principle\nIn the addition of angular momentum, there is a fundamental conservation law for the z-component. The z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed in terms of their quantum numbers as a strict selection rule:\n\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis rule means that a coupled state `|l, m>` is a superposition of only those uncoupled states `|m₁, m₂>` for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number. If this condition is not met, the probability of finding the system in that uncoupled state is zero.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Principle to the Problem\nLet's check if the selection rule is satisfied for the given initial state and the desired final state.\n\n1.  From the initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, the total magnetic quantum number is **`m = -1`**.\n2.  For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. Their sum is **`m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`**.\n3.  Compare the two values: `m = -1` and `m₁ + m₂ = -2`.\n\nSince `m ≠ m₁ + m₂` (`-1 ≠ -2`), the selection rule is violated.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Probability\nBecause the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a forbidden transition. The initial state `|l=2, m=-1>` is orthogonal to the final state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>`. The probability of measuring an outcome that is orthogonal to the initial state is exactly zero.\n\nThe probability is formally given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `|<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|²`. This coefficient is zero because the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is not met. Therefore, the probability is `0² = 0`.\n\n### Step 5: Match with the Given Options\nThe calculated probability is 0. The options are:\nA) 0\nB) 1/2\nC) 2/3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified that the probability is 0 based on the conservation of angular momentum. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to errors in mapping the numerical result of 0 to the correct option letter. The physical reasoning is sound and universally points to a probability of 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering all the careful points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Initial State of the System\nThe system consists of two electrons and is described by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n*   **Individual Angular Momenta**: The quantum numbers for the individual electrons are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$, as they are in p orbitals.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum**: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n*   **Z-Component of Total Angular Momentum**: The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum is $m=-1$. This is a critical piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$) with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\nTherefore, the measurement is asking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state described by $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nFor a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual measured quantum numbers ($m_1, m_2$) must equal the total quantum number ($m$) of the system's initial state.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Consistency\nLet's check if the desired outcome is consistent with the initial state using the selection rule.\n*   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n*   From the desired measurement outcome, we have the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nComparing the two values, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\nThe fact that the selection rule is violated means that the desired final state is not a possible component of the initial state. The initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is a superposition of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ for which the condition $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ holds (specifically, the states $|m_1=0, m_2=-1>$ and $|m_1=-1, m_2=0>$). The state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is not part of this superposition.\n\nIn the language of quantum mechanics, the initial state and the desired final state are orthogonal. The probability of measuring an outcome is the square of the magnitude of the inner product (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) between the initial and final states. Since the states are orthogonal, this inner product is zero.\n\n$P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and the underlying principles of quantum mechanics, here is a step-by-step derivation of the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The two-electron system is in the coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ (as expected for p-orbitals).\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**.

This is expressed by the operator equation $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Verify the Selection Rule**: We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing these values, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The selection rule is violated. This means that the uncoupled state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is not a component of the coupled state $|2, -1\\rangle$. The two states are orthogonal. The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|2, -1\\rangle$, and finding it in the state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is given by the square of the inner product of the two states (which is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient). Since the selection rule is violated, this coefficient is zero. Therefore, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: The problem is set up with an initial state in the coupled basis (where total angular momentum $l$ and its z-component $m$ are well-defined) and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis (where individual z-components $m_1$ and $m_2$ are well-defined). The connection between these bases is governed by strict rules.\n*   **The $m = m_1 + m_2$ Selection Rule**: This is a direct consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.

Therefore, the two states are orthogonal, and the probability of measuring this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is set up with the initial state in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement outcome in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The key to solving the problem is understanding the strict relationship between them.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a direct consequence of the operator identity $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. It is not an approximation. If the rule is violated, the probability of that outcome is exactly zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to view the problem is to recognize that the initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. In quantum mechanics, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The probability of a system in one eigenstate being measured in another, orthogonal eigenstate is zero.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The physical reasoning unanimously leads to a probability of 0.

The most important piece of information here for this specific question is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**.

The most important quantum number for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, `m = -1`. This value represents the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the system. The state is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Final State:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired measurement outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    For a transition or measurement to have a non-zero probability, this condition must be met.

An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ implies the magnetic quantum number for the first electron is **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ implies the magnetic quantum number for the second electron is **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This corresponds to finding the system in the *uncoupled* state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Careful Point):**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    For a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual measured magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the system's initial state.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    Let's check if the selection rule is satisfied for this problem.\n    *   From the initial state: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    Comparing the two values, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:**\n    Because the selection rule is violated, the transition from the initial state to the desired final state is forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum. Formally, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these two states, $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$, is zero.

The system is in a *coupled* angular momentum state, given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The state is given in the coupled basis, where the total angular momentum is well-defined. The crucial quantum number for this problem is $m = -1$, which is the magnetic quantum number for the *total* orbital angular momentum. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Final State:**\n    A measurement is made of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The basis for this measurement is the *uncoupled* basis, $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$.\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    Therefore, the desired final state is the uncoupled state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:**\n    The core principle connecting the coupled and uncoupled bases is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** This selection rule is absolute. A coupled state $|l, m>$ can only be formed by a superposition of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number. The probability of finding the system in an uncoupled state that violates this rule is zero.\n\n4.  **Check the Condition for the Given Problem:**\n    We must check if the selection rule is satisfied.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have the total magnetic quantum number **$m = -1$**.\n    *   From the desired final state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers **$m_1 = -1$** and **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    *   The sum for the final state is: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Now, we compare the initial state's total $m$ with the sum from the final state:\n    Is $m = m_1 + m_2$?\n    Is $-1 = -2$?\n    The condition is **not** satisfied.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, the transition from the initial state to the desired final state is forbidden. The probability of this measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$.

The initial state is given in the *coupled basis* as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    The most important piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    A measurement is made on the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to the system being found in the *uncoupled basis* state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    For the probability of measuring a specific combination of ($m_1, m_2$) to be non-zero, this condition must be met.\n\n4.  **Check if the Condition is Satisfied:**\n    We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state with the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state.\n    *   Initial state's total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   Desired final state's sum of magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (specifically, $-1 \\neq -2$), the selection rule is violated.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:**\n    Because the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is an impossible event. The probability of measuring this outcome is exactly 0.\n    Formally, the probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$. This coefficient is zero because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met. Therefore, the probability is $|0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is set up with the initial state in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement outcome in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The key is understanding the relationship between them.\n*   **Conservation of $L_z$ is a Strict Rule:** The initial state has a definite value for the total z-component of angular momentum ($m=-1$). This is not an average value; it's a precise quantum number. Any measurement of the individual components *must* yield values ($m_1, m_2$) that sum to this total.\n*   **Correctly Identifying Quantum Numbers:** It is crucial to correctly extract $m=-1$ from the initial state ket $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ and to correctly calculate the sum $m_1+m_2 = -2$ from the desired measurement outcome.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated probability is 0. According to the provided options (A) 0, B) 1/2, C) 2/3, D) 1), this corresponds to option A. A review of the candidate answers shows that while almost all of them correctly deduced the probability is 0, many failed to select the correct corresponding letter.\n\nBased on the unanimous physical reasoning across the provided answers and a correct mapping to the given options, the joint probability is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons in a p-orbital, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$. The system is in the *coupled* angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The crucial information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Final State:** A measurement is made of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the joint probability of getting an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for both measurements.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the desired final state after the measurement is the *uncoupled* state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired final state is consistent with the initial state according to this conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) is not equal to the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state ($m_1+m_2=-2$). Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, the transition from the initial state to this specific final state is forbidden. The probability of such an event is zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) where the total angular momentum is well-defined, and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$) where the individual components are well-defined. The connection between these bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The Selection Rule:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a strict selection rule. If it is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial and final states is exactly zero.\n*   **Probability:** The probability of a measurement outcome is the square of the magnitude of the probability amplitude (in this case, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient). Since the coefficient is zero, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** The conservation of the z-component of angular momentum means that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is a superposition of only those uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ for which $m_1+m_2 = -1$. The state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is not part of this superposition, so it cannot be found upon measurement.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly identified this core reasoning.

The correct probability is 0, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the key concepts and careful points.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\n*   **System:** Two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. So, we have $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in a *coupled* angular momentum state, given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The total magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the angular momentum is $m=-1$. This is a crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n*   **Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe central principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the **conservation of the z-component of angular momentum**. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThis operator relationship leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThis rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be formed by a superposition of uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) equals $m$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Principle to the Specifics of the Problem\n\n1.  **From the initial state** $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number of the system is precisely **$m = -1$**.\n2.  **For the desired measurement outcome**, we need $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n3.  **Check for consistency** by calculating the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the desired outcome:\n    $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n### Step 4: Draw the Conclusion\n\nWe compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the desired final state ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$).\n\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nIn the language of quantum mechanics, the probability of this measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is exactly zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is $P = |0|^2 = 0$. The event is impossible.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem\nThe core of the problem is to find the probability of a specific measurement outcome on a quantum system that is in a known initial state.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system of two electrons is in a *coupled* angular momentum state, given by `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l₁ = 1`, `l₂ = 1`: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers (p-orbitals).\n    *   `l = 2`: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   `m = -1`: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n*   **Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L₁z` as `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L₂z` as `-ħ`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of `L_z` is `m_l * ħ`. Therefore, an eigenvalue of `-ħ` corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of `-1`.\n    *   This means the desired final state has `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Governing Physical Principle\nIn the addition of angular momentum, there is a fundamental conservation law for the z-component. The z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed in terms of their quantum numbers as a strict selection rule:\n\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis rule means that a coupled state `|l, m>` is a superposition of only those uncoupled states `|m₁, m₂>` for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number. If this condition is not met, the probability of finding the system in that uncoupled state is zero.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Principle to the Problem\nLet's check if the selection rule is satisfied for the given initial state and the desired final state.\n\n1.  From the initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, the total magnetic quantum number is **`m = -1`**.\n2.  For the desired measurement outcome, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. Their sum is **`m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`**.\n3.  Compare the two values: `m = -1` and `m₁ + m₂ = -2`.\n\nSince `m ≠ m₁ + m₂` (`-1 ≠ -2`), the selection rule is violated.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Probability\nBecause the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a forbidden transition. The initial state `|l=2, m=-1>` is orthogonal to the final state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>`. The probability of measuring an outcome that is orthogonal to the initial state is exactly zero.\n\nThe probability is formally given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `|<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|²`. This coefficient is zero because the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is not met. Therefore, the probability is `0² = 0`.\n\n### Step 5: Match with the Given Options\nThe calculated probability is 0. The options are:\nA) 0\nB) 1/2\nC) 2/3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified that the probability is 0 based on the conservation of angular momentum. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to errors in mapping the numerical result of 0 to the correct option letter. The physical reasoning is sound and universally points to a probability of 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering all the careful points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Initial State of the System\nThe system consists of two electrons and is described by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n*   **Individual Angular Momenta**: The quantum numbers for the individual electrons are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$, as they are in p orbitals.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum**: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n*   **Z-Component of Total Angular Momentum**: The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum is $m=-1$. This is a critical piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$) with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\nTherefore, the measurement is asking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state described by $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nFor a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual measured quantum numbers ($m_1, m_2$) must equal the total quantum number ($m$) of the system's initial state.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Consistency\nLet's check if the desired outcome is consistent with the initial state using the selection rule.\n*   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n*   From the desired measurement outcome, we have the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nComparing the two values, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Probability\nThe fact that the selection rule is violated means that the desired final state is not a possible component of the initial state. The initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is a superposition of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ for which the condition $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ holds (specifically, the states $|m_1=0, m_2=-1>$ and $|m_1=-1, m_2=0>$). The state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is not part of this superposition.\n\nIn the language of quantum mechanics, the initial state and the desired final state are orthogonal. The probability of measuring an outcome is the square of the magnitude of the inner product (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) between the initial and final states. Since the states are orthogonal, this inner product is zero.\n\n$P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and the underlying principles of quantum mechanics, here is a step-by-step derivation of the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The two-electron system is in the coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ (as expected for p-orbitals).\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z$, with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m_l\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **m₁ = -1**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **m₂ = -1**.\n    *   Therefore, the measurement seeks to find the system in the uncoupled state described by $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the operator equation $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Verify the Selection Rule**: We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system.\n    *   From the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing these values, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The selection rule is violated. This means that the uncoupled state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is not a component of the coupled state $|2, -1\\rangle$. The two states are orthogonal. The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|2, -1\\rangle$, and finding it in the state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is given by the square of the inner product of the two states (which is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient). Since the selection rule is violated, this coefficient is zero. Therefore, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: The problem is set up with an initial state in the coupled basis (where total angular momentum $l$ and its z-component $m$ are well-defined) and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis (where individual z-components $m_1$ and $m_2$ are well-defined). The connection between these bases is governed by strict rules.\n*   **The $m = m_1 + m_2$ Selection Rule**: This is a direct consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. It is not an approximation; if the condition is not met, the probability of that specific outcome is exactly zero.\n*   **Eigenvalues vs. Quantum Numbers**: It is important to correctly translate the desired eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ into the corresponding magnetic quantum number $m_l = -1$.\n*   **Orthogonality**: An alternative way to see the result is to recognize that the initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. In quantum mechanics, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The probability of transitioning between orthogonal states is zero.\n\nAll candidate answers that correctly apply this conservation law arrive at a probability of 0. The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
