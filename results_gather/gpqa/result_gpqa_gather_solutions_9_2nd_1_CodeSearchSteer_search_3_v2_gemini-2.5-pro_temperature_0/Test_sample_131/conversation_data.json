There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.

All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the two signals originate from an equal number of protons. The most straightforward interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from each compound). The 2:1:1 ratio (total parts = 4) means the signals correspond to (2/4)*24H = 12H, (1/4)*24H = 6H, and (1/4)*24H = 6H. So, we are looking for a combination that produces three methyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**. (Note: Although adjacent, equivalent protons do not split each other, resulting in a singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 are equivalent (6H) and C2/C3 are equivalent (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. This compound can be immediately **eliminated**. This also eliminates option B.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **three aromatic signals**. This does not match the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **three aromatic signals**. This does not match the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nFirst, we must understand what the provided spectral data tells us about the unknown compounds in the 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that each compound produces a distinct aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture. The fact that they are all singlets is crucial, as it rules out any alkyl groups that would be split by adjacent protons (like ethyl groups).\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nTo find the correct pair, we must first predict the spectrum that each individual compound would produce. This is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be immediately eliminated because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This also eliminates option **D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining pairs in a 1:1 ratio to see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signal Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produce a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, which gives the required 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor must be the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signal Check:** We need the combination that results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would show a total of **four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would show up to **five** aliphatic singlets (or four if one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides **one** singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides **two** singlets (6H each).\n        *   The combined spectrum shows a total of **three** aliphatic singlets.\n        *   The integration values are 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **This is a perfect match** for both the aromatic and aliphatic data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Given Spectral Data:** First, I will interpret the information from the 1H NMR spectrum. The key details are:\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n    *   Aromatic region: Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region: Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n2.  **Calculate Proton Integrations:** The total number of aliphatic protons from two C10H14 molecules (each with 4 methyl groups) is 12 + 12 = 24. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts (2+1+1). I will calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    So, the mixture must produce three aliphatic singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n3.  **Predict Individual Spectra:** I will predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four candidate compounds based on their molecular symmetry. This will tell us how many aromatic and aliphatic signals each compound produces and their integrations.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Mixture Options:** I will combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option (A, B, C, D) and check if the result matches the experimental data (two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets of 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The option that perfectly matches both the aromatic and aliphatic data will be the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the two compounds in a mixture based on 1H NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the given spectral data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region: Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region: Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"  - This implies the mixture must contain two different compounds that each produce one 2H aromatic singlet.\")\n    print(\"  - The aliphatic signals must combine to give three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the predicted spectral characteristics for each compound.\n    # Data format: { \"aromatic_H\": [integrations], \"aliphatic_H\": [integrations] }\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": [2], \"aliphatic_H\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": [2], \"aliphatic_H\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": [2], \"aliphatic_H\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": [4], \"aliphatic_H\": \"non-singlets\"}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicted 1H NMR signals for individual compounds.\")\n    for name, data in compounds.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}:\")\n        print(f\"    - Aromatic: {len(data['aromatic_H'])} signal(s) with integration(s) {data['aromatic_H']}H\")\n        if isinstance(data['aliphatic_H'], list):\n            print(f\"    - Aliphatic: {len(data['aliphatic_H'])} singlet(s) with integration(s) {data['aliphatic_H']}H\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"    - Aliphatic: Produces non-singlet signals (quartet/triplet).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Define the options and evaluate them.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\")\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluating each mixture option.\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, (name1, name2) in options.items():\n        print(f\"\\nTesting Option {option}: {name1} and {name2}\")\n        comp1 = compounds[name1]\n        comp2 = compounds[name2]\n\n        # Rule out any option with 1,4-diethylbenzene\n        if comp1[\"aliphatic_H\"] == \"non-singlets\" or comp2[\"aliphatic_H\"] == \"non-singlets\":\n            print(\"  - Result: FAILED.

Deconstruct the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a critical piece of information for interpreting the integration ratios.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. This means the mixture contains two distinct types of aromatic protons, and the total number of protons for each type is equal. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this implies that each compound contributes a signal representing the same number of protons (e.g., both compounds have a 2H singlet).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals come from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings. The total number of aliphatic protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H (from the first compound) + 12H (from the second compound) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 (equivalent, 6H), C2 (unique, 3H), and C5 (unique, 3H). This gives **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal** integrating to **2H**. (In introductory problems, this AA' system is treated as a singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 (equivalent, 6H) and C2/C3 (equivalent, 6H). This gives **two singlets** with a 6H:6H (or 1:1) ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin splitting, producing a **quartet** and a **triplet**. This contradicts the problem statement that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe can immediately eliminate option D because it contains 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's analyze the remaining options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic region: This mixture would show three signals (one 2H singlet from the first compound and two 1H singlets from the second). This does not match the \"two signals\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic region: This mixture would also show three signals (one 2H singlet and two 1H singlets). This does not match the \"two signals\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information given from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1. This means the number of protons from each compound contributes equally to the overall spectrum's integration.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This implies there are two distinct aromatic proton environments in the mixture. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the most straightforward interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This tells us about the combined methyl protons from both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent non-equivalent protons, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible. They produce **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3 (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, or 1:1.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-). This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option C.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   Two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's test the remaining options based on the prompt's labeling:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals (2H, 1H, 1H). This does not match the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the two compounds present in the mixture, we will follow a systematic, step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided 1H NMR Data\n\nFirst, let's carefully examine the information given about the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets, with a combined integration ratio of 2:1:1. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets is a critical piece of information, as it rules out any alkyl groups that would show spin-spin splitting (like ethyl groups).\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be split by the adjacent -CH3- protons into a quartet, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out option A.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. In introductory NMR problems, equivalent protons are treated as giving a single signal with no splitting. Therefore, they produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options\n\nWe have eliminated option A. Now we test options B, C, and D.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would contain one 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This results in a total of three aromatic signals, which contradicts the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would also contain one 2H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB), for a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this produces **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets of 6H each. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly matches all the described 1H NMR data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the final answer, a careful, step-by-step analysis of the problem is required, focusing on predicting the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound and then evaluating the proposed mixtures.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Given Spectral Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds with the formula C10H14:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe key to this problem is correctly predicting the spectrum of each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound contains ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons are split by the -CH3- protons, resulting in a quartet, and the -CH3- protons are split by the -CH2- protons, resulting in a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately invalidates option C.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent non-equivalent protons, so they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the \"inner\" pair at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This plane of symmetry makes the two protons at positions 4 and 6 chemically equivalent. They appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H), the one at C2 is unique (3H), and the one at C5 is unique (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this produces **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would show a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is invalid as 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one 6H signal from each compound overlaps). This contradicts the data, which specifies only three signals.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided 1H NMR Data\n\nFirst, we must understand what the spectral data tells us about the unknown compounds in the 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. This is most simply explained if each compound produces one aromatic singlet, and each of those singlets represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue, indicating that the protons are not adjacent to any other non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Chemically equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region, not just singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **eliminated** from consideration. This also eliminates option B.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H aromatic singlet each. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We combine the aliphatic signals for each pair to see which one matches the data.\n\n    *   **Option A (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have up to five signals (or four if one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n    *   **Option C (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n        *   The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the aliphatic data.\n\n    *   **Option D (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have a total of four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's carefully interpret the information provided by the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Two signals\" means there are two distinct aromatic proton environments in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second signal (since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Three signals\" means there are three distinct aliphatic proton environments in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" indicates these are likely methyl groups not adjacent to any ring protons.\n    *   \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons in these three environments.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

In introductory NMR problems, equivalent protons adjacent to each other are treated as producing a single signal. This gives **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" ones (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" ones (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, C5 is unique). This gives **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-).

This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture of these two will produce **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a key piece of information for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second singlet.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. This describes the combined methyl proton signals from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo predict the spectrum, we must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically unique proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through carbons 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin splitting. The -CH2- protons will appear as a quartet and the -CH3- protons will appear as a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **this compound can be eliminated**.

Isodurene gives one 2H singlet. The mixture would correctly show two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would show a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives one 2H singlet. The mixture would correctly show two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Prehnitene gives two singlets (6H, 6H). Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets**, and since both represent 2H in a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio will be **1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the data.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must understand what the provided spectral data tells us about the molecular structures in the 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** \"Two signals (two singlets) ... in a 1:1 ratio.\"\n    *   The presence of only singlets indicates that the aromatic protons on each molecule do not have any non-equivalent neighboring protons to couple with.\n    *   Since the mixture is 1:1 molar, the 1:1 integration ratio means that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second singlet.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** \"Three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\"\n    *   The chemical shift (~2.2 ppm) is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   The fact that they are all singlets means these methyl groups are not attached to a carbon with any protons.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio represents the relative number of total protons from both compounds that make up these three distinct signals.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: (C1+C3), C2, and C5. This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**. (Note: While technically an AA' system, it is typically observed as a singlet in this context).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: (C1+C4) and (C2+C3). This gives **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H, for a **1:1** ratio.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-). This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be immediately eliminated.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would show three signals (one 2H singlet from prehnitene and two 1H singlets from isodurene). This contradicts the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would also show three signals (one 2H singlet from durene and two 1H singlets from isodurene). This contradicts the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Durene provides one 2H singlet.

This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Durene provides one singlet (12H). Prehnitene provides two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Analyze the NMR Data\nFirst, we must understand the information provided by the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. This means that the proton integrations from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that the two signals originate from an equal number of protons. The most straightforward interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\nThe key to this problem is accurately predicting the spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C5 axis.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (for the -CH2- protons) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3- protons) due to spin-spin splitting. The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be immediately eliminated**. This also eliminates option C.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Data:** The mixture has two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce one 2H singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, matching the 1:1 ratio. This means the aromatic data alone is insufficient to distinguish the correct pair; we must use the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Data:** The mixture has three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. Let's test the valid combinations.\n\n    *   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined: This would result in a total of **four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n    *   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   Combined: This results in a total of **three** aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **This is a perfect match for the experimental data.**\n\n    *   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined: This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly reproduces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.

These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo predict the spectrum, we must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups are not singlets. The -CH2- protons are split by the -CH3 protons into a quartet, and the -CH3 protons are split into a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, this compound can be **eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).

This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio** (2H:2H). This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we will systematically analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate molecule and then evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Given Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates two different types of aromatic protons in the mixture. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons represented by each singlet must be equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This represents the combined total of all methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds.\n\n### **2. Prediction of Individual 1H NMR Spectra**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

In many contexts, especially for introductory problems, equivalent protons are treated as not splitting each other, resulting in **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the equivalent pair at C2/C3 (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region due to spin-spin splitting.

Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nWe need to find the pair of compounds that, when combined in a 1:1 ratio, matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Eliminate options containing 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Option A contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is incorrect due to its non-singlet aliphatic signals.\n*   **Eliminate options containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Options A, B, and C all contain 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This compound itself produces two aromatic singlets. When mixed with another compound that produces at least one aromatic singlet, the mixture would show three aromatic signals, which contradicts the data (\"two signals\").\n\nThis process of elimination leaves only one possible option. Let's verify it.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Remaining Option\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of these two will show **two singlets**, each representing 2H. The integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets, each for 6H.\n    *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nThis combination is the only one that fully accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided by the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The most direct interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds.\n    *   The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from each C10H14 isomer). The 2:1:1 ratio (total of 4 parts) corresponds to signals with integrations of (2/4)*24H = 12H, (1/4)*24H = 6H, and (1/4)*24H = 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 protons, and the -CH3 protons would be split into a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **this compound can be immediately eliminated**. This also eliminates option B.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two 2H singlets (which gives the required 1:1 ratio). All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H singlet each, so any pair will satisfy this condition.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the remaining combinations based on their combined aliphatic signals:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would show a total of **four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would show at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals from each compound overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio.

All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the two signals originate from an equal number of protons. The most straightforward interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from each compound). The 2:1:1 ratio (total parts = 4) means the signals correspond to (2/4)*24H = 12H, (1/4)*24H = 6H, and (1/4)*24H = 6H. So, we are looking for a combination that produces three methyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**. (Note: Although adjacent, equivalent protons do not split each other, resulting in a singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 are equivalent (6H) and C2/C3 are equivalent (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. This compound can be immediately **eliminated**. This also eliminates option B.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **three aromatic signals**. This does not match the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **three aromatic signals**. This does not match the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nFirst, we must understand what the provided spectral data tells us about the unknown compounds in the 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that each compound produces a distinct aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture. The fact that they are all singlets is crucial, as it rules out any alkyl groups that would be split by adjacent protons (like ethyl groups).\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nTo find the correct pair, we must first predict the spectrum that each individual compound would produce. This is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be immediately eliminated because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This also eliminates option **D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining pairs in a 1:1 ratio to see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signal Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produce a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, which gives the required 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor must be the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signal Check:** We need the combination that results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would show a total of **four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would show up to **five** aliphatic singlets (or four if one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides **one** singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides **two** singlets (6H each).\n        *   The combined spectrum shows a total of **three** aliphatic singlets.\n        *   The integration values are 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **This is a perfect match** for both the aromatic and aliphatic data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Given Spectral Data:** First, I will interpret the information from the 1H NMR spectrum. The key details are:\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n    *   Aromatic region: Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region: Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n2.  **Calculate Proton Integrations:** The total number of aliphatic protons from two C10H14 molecules (each with 4 methyl groups) is 12 + 12 = 24. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts (2+1+1). I will calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    So, the mixture must produce three aliphatic singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n3.  **Predict Individual Spectra:** I will predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four candidate compounds based on their molecular symmetry. This will tell us how many aromatic and aliphatic signals each compound produces and their integrations.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Mixture Options:** I will combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option (A, B, C, D) and check if the result matches the experimental data (two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets of 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The option that perfectly matches both the aromatic and aliphatic data will be the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the two compounds in a mixture based on 1H NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the given spectral data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region: Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region: Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"  - This implies the mixture must contain two different compounds that each produce one 2H aromatic singlet.\")\n    print(\"  - The aliphatic signals must combine to give three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the predicted spectral characteristics for each compound.\n    # Data format: { \"aromatic_H\": [integrations], \"aliphatic_H\": [integrations] }\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": [2], \"aliphatic_H\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": [2], \"aliphatic_H\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": [2], \"aliphatic_H\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": [4], \"aliphatic_H\": \"non-singlets\"}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicted 1H NMR signals for individual compounds.\")\n    for name, data in compounds.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}:\")\n        print(f\"    - Aromatic: {len(data['aromatic_H'])} signal(s) with integration(s) {data['aromatic_H']}H\")\n        if isinstance(data['aliphatic_H'], list):\n            print(f\"    - Aliphatic: {len(data['aliphatic_H'])} singlet(s) with integration(s) {data['aliphatic_H']}H\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"    - Aliphatic: Produces non-singlet signals (quartet/triplet).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Define the options and evaluate them.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\")\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluating each mixture option.\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, (name1, name2) in options.items():\n        print(f\"\\nTesting Option {option}: {name1} and {name2}\")\n        comp1 = compounds[name1]\n        comp2 = compounds[name2]\n\n        # Rule out any option with 1,4-diethylbenzene\n        if comp1[\"aliphatic_H\"] == \"non-singlets\" or comp2[\"aliphatic_H\"] == \"non-singlets\":\n            print(\"  - Result: FAILED.

Deconstruct the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a critical piece of information for interpreting the integration ratios.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. This means the mixture contains two distinct types of aromatic protons, and the total number of protons for each type is equal. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this implies that each compound contributes a signal representing the same number of protons (e.g., both compounds have a 2H singlet).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals come from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings. The total number of aliphatic protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H (from the first compound) + 12H (from the second compound) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 (equivalent, 6H), C2 (unique, 3H), and C5 (unique, 3H). This gives **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal** integrating to **2H**. (In introductory problems, this AA' system is treated as a singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 (equivalent, 6H) and C2/C3 (equivalent, 6H). This gives **two singlets** with a 6H:6H (or 1:1) ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin splitting, producing a **quartet** and a **triplet**. This contradicts the problem statement that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe can immediately eliminate option D because it contains 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's analyze the remaining options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic region: This mixture would show three signals (one 2H singlet from the first compound and two 1H singlets from the second). This does not match the \"two signals\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic region: This mixture would also show three signals (one 2H singlet and two 1H singlets). This does not match the \"two signals\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information given from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1. This means the number of protons from each compound contributes equally to the overall spectrum's integration.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This implies there are two distinct aromatic proton environments in the mixture. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the most straightforward interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This tells us about the combined methyl protons from both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent non-equivalent protons, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible. They produce **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3 (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, or 1:1.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-). This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option C.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   Two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's test the remaining options based on the prompt's labeling:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals (2H, 1H, 1H). This does not match the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the two compounds present in the mixture, we will follow a systematic, step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided 1H NMR Data\n\nFirst, let's carefully examine the information given about the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets, with a combined integration ratio of 2:1:1. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets is a critical piece of information, as it rules out any alkyl groups that would show spin-spin splitting (like ethyl groups).\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be split by the adjacent -CH3- protons into a quartet, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out option A.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. In introductory NMR problems, equivalent protons are treated as giving a single signal with no splitting. Therefore, they produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options\n\nWe have eliminated option A. Now we test options B, C, and D.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would contain one 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This results in a total of three aromatic signals, which contradicts the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would also contain one 2H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB), for a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this produces **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets of 6H each. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly matches all the described 1H NMR data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the final answer, a careful, step-by-step analysis of the problem is required, focusing on predicting the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound and then evaluating the proposed mixtures.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Given Spectral Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds with the formula C10H14:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe key to this problem is correctly predicting the spectrum of each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound contains ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons are split by the -CH3- protons, resulting in a quartet, and the -CH3- protons are split by the -CH2- protons, resulting in a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately invalidates option C.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent non-equivalent protons, so they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the \"inner\" pair at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This plane of symmetry makes the two protons at positions 4 and 6 chemically equivalent. They appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H), the one at C2 is unique (3H), and the one at C5 is unique (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this produces **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would show a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is invalid as 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one 6H signal from each compound overlaps). This contradicts the data, which specifies only three signals.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided 1H NMR Data\n\nFirst, we must understand what the spectral data tells us about the unknown compounds in the 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. This is most simply explained if each compound produces one aromatic singlet, and each of those singlets represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue, indicating that the protons are not adjacent to any other non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Chemically equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region, not just singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **eliminated** from consideration. This also eliminates option B.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H aromatic singlet each. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two distinct 2H singlets, satisfying the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" condition. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We combine the aliphatic signals for each pair to see which one matches the data.\n\n    *   **Option A (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have up to five signals (or four if one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n    *   **Option C (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n        *   The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the aliphatic data.\n\n    *   **Option D (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have a total of four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's carefully interpret the information provided by the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Two signals\" means there are two distinct aromatic proton environments in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second signal (since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Three signals\" means there are three distinct aliphatic proton environments in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" indicates these are likely methyl groups not adjacent to any ring protons.\n    *   \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons in these three environments.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. In introductory NMR problems, equivalent protons adjacent to each other are treated as producing a single signal. This gives **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" ones (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" ones (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, C5 is unique). This gives **three singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-).

This results in **three** aromatic signals, which contradicts the \"two signals\" data. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would contain one 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This also results in **three** aromatic signals, contradicting the data. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture of these two will produce **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.

They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through carbons 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin splitting.

All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. This means that the proton integrations from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that the two signals originate from an equal number of protons. The most straightforward interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\nThe key to this problem is accurately predicting the spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C5 axis.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (for the -CH2- protons) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3- protons) due to spin-spin splitting. The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be immediately eliminated**. This also eliminates option C.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Data:** The mixture has two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce one 2H singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, matching the 1:1 ratio. This means the aromatic data alone is insufficient to distinguish the correct pair; we must use the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Data:** The mixture has three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. Let's test the valid combinations.\n\n    *   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   Combined: This would result in a total of **four** aliphatic singlets.

This does not match the data.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly reproduces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.

Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that each compound contributes an aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo predict the spectrum, we must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups are not singlets. The -CH2- protons are split by the -CH3 protons into a quartet, and the -CH3 protons are split into a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, this compound can be **eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio** (2H:2H). This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we will systematically analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate molecule and then evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Given Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates two different types of aromatic protons in the mixture. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons represented by each singlet must be equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This represents the combined total of all methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds.\n\n### **2. Prediction of Individual 1H NMR Spectra**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbons at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. In many contexts, especially for introductory problems, equivalent protons are treated as not splitting each other, resulting in **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the equivalent pair at C2/C3 (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region due to spin-spin splitting. The problem specifies that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **eliminated**.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H or **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit for all the provided spectral data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information given for the 1:1 mixture spectrum:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets, with a combined integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals arise from the methyl groups of both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has only one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They would produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**. This compound alone would produce two aromatic signals, meaning a mixture containing it would likely show more than two aromatic signals, contradicting the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (C1/C3, C2, C5), resulting in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They appear as **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-). This contradicts the data stating all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nWe need to find the pair of compounds that, when combined in a 1:1 ratio, matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Eliminate options containing 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Option A contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is incorrect due to its non-singlet aliphatic signals.\n*   **Eliminate options containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Options A, B, and C all contain 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This compound itself produces two aromatic singlets. When mixed with another compound that produces at least one aromatic singlet, the mixture would show three aromatic signals, which contradicts the data (\"two signals\").\n\nThis process of elimination leaves only one possible option. Let's verify it.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Remaining Option\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of these two will show **two singlets**, each representing 2H. The integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets, each for 6H.\n    *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nThis combination is the only one that fully accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
