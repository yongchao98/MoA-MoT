Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we need to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, which we'll call `m₁` (the more massive) and `m₂`.\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given that `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Sum of Masses:** We are also given that the sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations. Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nFrom this, we can find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2m₂ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNow, we can calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁c²`): `0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂c²`): `0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted entirely into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.\n\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\n\nThe classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   `T₁,class = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂,class = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`\nSince `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n`T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class = 1 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic mechanics. The relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n\nFrom conservation of momentum, the relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite (`p₁ = p₂ = p`). Therefore, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\nWe can express `(pc)²` in terms of kinetic energy: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\nEquating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments:\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nWe know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 GeV - T₁`. We substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n`Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert this value to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m₁`, is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses. We can solve for their rest-mass energies (`mc²`):\n1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted entirely into the kinetic energy of the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n\n`Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the fragments is `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`). The kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n\n*   From this, we can establish a ratio: `T₁ / T₂ = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `T₁ / T₂ = 1/2`, which means `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n*   We know the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T₂ = 2T₁`: `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`, which gives `3T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the classical kinetic energy is `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic formulas. The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n\n*   From these, we can derive a relationship for momentum: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since momentum is conserved (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁` (all in GeV).\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand the terms:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then group the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   Solving for the correct relativistic kinetic energy:\n    `T₁,rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁,rel - T₁,class`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert this result to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a problem in relativistic mechanics. I will solve it by first determining the properties of the system, such as the rest masses of the fragments and the total energy released. Then, I will calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using both classical and relativistic formulas. Finally, I will find the difference between these two values.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Initial Values:** Set the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (`Mc^2`) to 300 GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:** Use the given relationships (`m1 = 2*m2` and `m1 + m2 = 0.99*M`) to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m1c^2` and `m2c^2`.\n3.  **Calculate Q-value:** Determine the total kinetic energy released (`Q`) by finding the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Calculate Classical T1:** In the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is shared inversely proportional to mass. Calculate `T1_classical` for the more massive fragment (`m1`).\n5.  **Calculate Relativistic T1:** Use the relativistic energy-momentum conservation laws to find the correct kinetic energy, `T1_relativistic`. The key relation derived from momentum conservation is `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2`.\n6.  **Compute the Difference:** Calculate the difference `T1_relativistic - T1_classical` and convert the result from GeV to MeV.\n7.  **Select the Final Answer:** Match the calculated difference to the given options.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define Initial Values\nMc2_GeV = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n# From m1 = 2*m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99*M, we get:\n# 3*m2 = 0.99*M => m2 = 0.33*M\n# m1 = 0.66*M\nm1c2_GeV = 0.66 * Mc2_GeV\nm2c2_GeV = 0.33 * Mc2_GeV\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n# Q = T1 + T2 = Initial_Rest_Energy - Final_Rest_Energy\nQ_GeV = Mc2_GeV - (m1c2_GeV + m2c2_GeV)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n# In classical mechanics, T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2, so T2 = 2*T1.\n# T1 + T2 = Q => T1 + 2*T1 = Q => 3*T1 = Q\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV / 3.0\n\n# Step 5: Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_relativistic)\n# From conservation of momentum (p1=p2), we have:\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2\n# We also know T2 = Q - T1.\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2c^2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*m2c^2 - 2*T1*m2c^2\n# The T1^2 terms cancel.

Understand the Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV` is at rest. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses. We can solve this system for their rest-mass energies (`mc²`).\n1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released in the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum for each fragment.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   `T₁,class = p² / (2m₁)`\n    *   `T₂,class = p² / (2m₂)`\n    *   Dividing the two equations gives: `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁`.\n    *   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, we have `T₁,class / T₂,class = 1/2`, which means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We know the total kinetic energy is `Q = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T₁,class = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite: `p₁ = p₂ = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`).\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy was `Mc²`. The final total energy is `E₁ + E₂`.\n    *   `E₁ + E₂ = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for Energies:** Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    *   `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`\n    *   `E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n    *   `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`\n    *   Substitute `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`:\n    *   `(E₁ - E₂)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n    *   `E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for `E₁` and `E₂`:\n    1.  `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Adding the two equations gives `2E₁ = 398.01 GeV`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   **Finding T₁:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    *   `T₁,rel = E₁ - m₁c²`\n    *   `T₁,rel = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**6.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\n*   Let `M` be the mass of the initial nucleus, and `m1` and `m2` be the masses of the two fragments.\n*   The initial rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nNow, we solve this system of equations:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n2.  This simplifies to `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`, which gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n3.  From this, we find `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `m1c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`): `m2c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted entirely into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = Mc² - (m1c² + m2c²)`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let `p_cl` be the magnitude of the classical momentum for each fragment.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   `T1_cl = p_cl² / (2 * m1)`\n    *   `T2_cl = p_cl² / (2 * m2)`\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** By dividing the two equations, we find the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n    *   `T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = (0.33 * M) / (0.66 * M) = 1/2`.\n    *   This means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   **Solving for T1_cl:** We use the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl + 2 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`).\n*   From this, we can derive `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since the momenta are equal, `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`:\n    *   `E1² - (m1c²)² = E2² - (m2c²)²`\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is also conserved: `E1 + E2 = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for Energies:** We can rearrange the momentum equation:\n    *   `E1² - E2² = (m1c²)² - (m2c²)²`\n    *   `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`\n    *   Substitute `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   `(E1 - E2)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n    *   `E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n    1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Adding the two equations gives `2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`, so `E1 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   **Finding T1_rel:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    *   `T1_rel = E1 - m1c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5.

Therefore, `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   We know the total kinetic energy is `T₁_class + T₂_class = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn special relativity, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   This can be rearranged to express momentum in terms of kinetic energy `T` (where `E = T + mc²`): `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   From the conservation of momentum, `p₁ = p₂`, so `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n*   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n*   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`.\n*   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`.\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n*   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n*   `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`.\n*   `600T₁ = 603`.\n*   `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the difference and convert the units to MeV.\n*   `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`.\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while many perform the calculation correctly, several select the wrong final option.

Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   `T₁_class = p² / (2m₁)`\n    *   `T₂_class = p² / (2m₂)`\n    *   Dividing the two gives: `T₁_class / T₂_class = m₂ / m₁`.\n    *   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_class:**\n    *   We know `T₁_class + T₂_class = Q = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `T₂_class`: `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E = T + mc²` is the total energy.\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy was `Mc² = 300 GeV`. The final total energy is `E₁ + E₂`. Therefore, `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for Energies:**\n    *   Since the momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`, which means `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   Rearranging gives `E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   Factoring the left side: `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   Substitute the known values: `(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`.\n    *   `(E₁ - E₂)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`.\n    *   `E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for E₁:** We now have a system of two linear equations:\n    1.  `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`\n    *   Adding the two equations gives `2E₁ = 398.01 GeV`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_rel:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    *   `T₁_rel = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_rel - T₁_class`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV` is at rest.\n*   **Final State:** It fissions into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relation:** `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (`T₁_correct`) and classical mechanics (`T₁_classical`).\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis step is performed consistently and correctly by all agents who show their work.\n*   From `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`, we solve the system:\n    *   `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M` => `3m₂ = 0.99M` => `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    *   `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n*   Convert these to rest-mass energies using `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n    *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis step is also performed consistently and correctly across the agents.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From this, we get the ratio `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, which means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n    *   `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nThis is the crucial step. The agents use two valid methods, both leading to the same result.\n*   **Method A (using kinetic energies):**\n    *   The relativistic momentum is given by `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n    *   Since momenta are equal, `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    *   Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`:\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n        `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        `600T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n*   **Method B (using total energies):**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** `E₁ + E₂ = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** `(pc)² = E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   This leads to `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`.\n    *   Solving the system `E₁ + E₂ = 300` and `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01` gives `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_correct = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\nBoth methods correctly yield `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the detailed calculations is that the difference in kinetic energy is **5 MeV**. The confusion in the provided answers stems from mapping this correct numerical result to the multiple-choice options. For the question as stated with the options:\nA) 5 MeV\nB) 20 MeV\nC) 10 MeV\nD) 2 MeV\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value\n\nFirst, we determine the properties of the two fragments resulting from the fission.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relations:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`) and that their combined mass is 99% of the original mass (`m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`).\n*   **Solving for Fragment Masses:**\n    *   Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    *   From this, we find the mass of the larger fragment: `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n*   **Calculating Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment is `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculating the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released as kinetic energy (`Q`) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn the non-relativistic approximation, we use classical mechanics.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Kinetic Energy Ratio:** The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore `T₁/T₂ = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio `m₂/m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV` => `3T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic formulas.\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²`:\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    *   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Finding the Difference\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and classical values and convert it to MeV.\n\n*   **Difference in GeV:** `Difference = T₁,correct - T₁,classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Difference in MeV:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis result matches option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most perform the calculation correctly to arrive at 5 MeV, many then select the wrong letter. The correct calculation leads to 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV` is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m₁`, is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Sum:** The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\nWe can solve the system of equations for the masses:\n1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  This yields `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  Consequently, `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n\nNow, we find their rest-mass energies based on the initial value `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\nThe energy released during fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nDue to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum for each fragment.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   Therefore, `p² = 2m₁T₁_class` and `p² = 2m₂T₂_class`, which implies `m₁T₁_class = m₂T₂_class`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_class / T₂_class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, so `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T₂_class`: `T₁_class + 2T₁_class = 3 GeV`, which means `3T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   **`T₁_classical = 1 GeV`**.\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n*   This can be rearranged to find the momentum: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), their squares are also equal: `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n*   Therefore: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n*   We know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`. We substitute this and the rest-mass energies (in GeV) into the equation:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding and simplifying:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **`T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`**.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical value for T₁.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, we convert the answer to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV` is at rest. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m₁`, is twice the mass of the lighter fragment, `m₂`. So, `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation).\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies for the two fragments.\n1.  We have a system of two equations: `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  Substituting the first into the second gives `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which simplifies to `3m₂ = 0.99M`, or `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  From this, we find `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n4.  Now, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn non-relativistic mechanics, due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   The kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,cl / T₂,cl = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T₂,cl = 2 * T₁,cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁,cl + T₂,cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁,cl + 2*T₁,cl = 3 GeV`, which gives `3*T₁,cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the classical kinetic energy is `T₁,cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy `T` as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding the terms:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We simplify the remaining equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5.

    "Based on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the physics and mathematics, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the difference between the kinetic energy of a fission fragment calculated using relativistic mechanics versus classical mechanics.\n\n**1. Initial and Final State Parameters:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`. The nucleus is at rest.\n*   Fragments' rest-masses: `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   Mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   Sum of final rest-masses: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n**2.

Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\nThe Q-value is the energy released from the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This was also calculated correctly by all candidates.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation):**\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, momentum conservation (`p₁ = p₂`) and the kinetic energy formula `T = p² / (2m)` lead to the conclusion that kinetic energy is shared inversely proportional to mass.\n*   `T₁,class / T₂,class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   Since `T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`, we find `T₁,class + 2*T₁,class = 3 GeV`.\n*   This gives `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value):**\nFor the correct value, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. From this, one can derive `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`) means we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Solving this equation for `T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + T₁² + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁,relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we need to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, which we'll call `m₁` (the more massive) and `m₂`.\n\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given that `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Sum of Masses:** We are also given that the sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations. Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nFrom this, we can find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2m₂ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNow, we can calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁c²`): `0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂c²`): `0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted entirely into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.\n\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\n\nThe classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   `T₁,class = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂,class = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T₁,class / T₂,class = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`\nSince `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2`. This means `T₂,class = 2 * T₁,class`.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n`T₁,class + T₂,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class + 2 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁,class = 3 GeV`\n`T₁,class = 1 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic mechanics. The relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n\nFrom conservation of momentum, the relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite (`p₁ = p₂ = p`). Therefore, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\nWe can express `(pc)²` in terms of kinetic energy: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\nEquating the `(pc)²` terms for both fragments:\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nWe know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 GeV - T₁`. We substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n`Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert this value to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m₁`, is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses. We can solve for their rest-mass energies (`mc²`):\n1.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n2.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n`m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted entirely into the kinetic energy of the two fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n\n`Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the fragments is `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`). The kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n\n*   From this, we can establish a ratio: `T₁ / T₂ = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `T₁ / T₂ = 1/2`, which means `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n*   We know the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T₂ = 2T₁`: `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`, which gives `3T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the classical kinetic energy is `T₁,class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic formulas. The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n\n*   From these, we can derive a relationship for momentum: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since momentum is conserved (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²` for both fragments:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁` (all in GeV).\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand the terms:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We then group the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   Solving for the correct relativistic kinetic energy:\n    `T₁,rel = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁,rel - T₁,class`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, we convert this result to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a problem in relativistic mechanics. I will solve it by first determining the properties of the system, such as the rest masses of the fragments and the total energy released. Then, I will calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using both classical and relativistic formulas. Finally, I will find the difference between these two values.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Initial Values:** Set the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (`Mc^2`) to 300 GeV.\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:** Use the given relationships (`m1 = 2*m2` and `m1 + m2 = 0.99*M`) to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m1c^2` and `m2c^2`.\n3.  **Calculate Q-value:** Determine the total kinetic energy released (`Q`) by finding the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n4.  **Calculate Classical T1:** In the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is shared inversely proportional to mass.

Let `m1` be the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nNow, we solve this system of equations:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n2.  This simplifies to `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`, which gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n3.  From this, we find `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `m1c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`): `m2c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2.

Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`).\n*   From this, we can derive `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`. Since the momenta are equal, `(p1c)² = (p2c)²`:\n    *   `E1² - (m1c²)² = E2² - (m2c²)²`\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is also conserved: `E1 + E2 = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for Energies:** We can rearrange the momentum equation:\n    *   `E1² - E2² = (m1c²)² - (m2c²)²`\n    *   `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`\n    *   Substitute `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   `(E1 - E2)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n    *   `E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n    1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Adding the two equations gives `2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`, so `E1 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   **Finding T1_rel:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    *   `T1_rel = E1 - m1c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5.

Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\n1.  We have a system of two equations: `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  Substitute the first into the second: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  From this, we find `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n4.  Now, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3.

Therefore, `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   We know the total kinetic energy is `T₁_class + T₂_class = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn special relativity, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   This can be rearranged to express momentum in terms of kinetic energy `T` (where `E = T + mc²`): `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   From the conservation of momentum, `p₁ = p₂`, so `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n*   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n*   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`.\n*   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`.\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n*   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`.\n*   `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`.\n*   `600T₁ = 603`.\n*   `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the difference and convert the units to MeV.\n*   `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`.\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while many perform the calculation correctly, several select the wrong final option.

Deconstruct the Problem and Define Variables**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments.\n    *   Rest-mass of the more massive fragment: `m₁`.\n    *   Rest-mass of the less massive fragment: `m₂`.\n    *   Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment: `T₁`.\n*   **Given Relationships:**\n    1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n    2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe can solve the system of equations for the masses (or their corresponding rest-mass energies).\n1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the second equation: `(2m₂) + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  Solve for `m₂`: `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  Solve for `m₁`: `m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n\nNow, convert these masses to their rest-mass energies using the initial value `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   `T₁_class = p² / (2m₁)`\n    *   `T₂_class = p² / (2m₂)`\n    *   Dividing the two gives: `T₁_class / T₂_class = m₂ / m₁`.\n    *   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_class:**\n    *   We know `T₁_class + T₂_class = Q = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `T₂_class`: `T₁_class + 2 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_class = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E = T + mc²` is the total energy.\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²`.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy was `Mc² = 300 GeV`. The final total energy is `E₁ + E₂`. Therefore, `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for Energies:**\n    *   Since the momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`, which means `E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   Rearranging gives `E₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   Factoring the left side: `(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   Substitute the known values: `(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²`.\n    *   `(E₁ - E₂)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`.\n    *   `E₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for E₁:** We now have a system of two linear equations:\n    1.  `E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`\n    *   Adding the two equations gives `2E₁ = 398.01 GeV`, so `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_rel:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    *   `T₁_rel = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_rel - T₁_class`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV` is at rest.\n*   **Final State:** It fissions into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relation:** `m₁ = 2m₂` (where `m₁` is the more massive fragment).\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) calculated using relativistic mechanics (`T₁_correct`) and classical mechanics (`T₁_classical`).\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nThis step is performed consistently and correctly by all agents who show their work.\n*   From `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`, we solve the system:\n    *   `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M` => `3m₂ = 0.99M` => `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    *   `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n*   Convert these to rest-mass energies using `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n    *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nThis step is also performed consistently and correctly across the agents.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From this, we get the ratio `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, which means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n    *   `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nThis is the crucial step. The agents use two valid methods, both leading to the same result.\n*   **Method A (using kinetic energies):**\n    *   The relativistic momentum is given by `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n    *   Since momenta are equal, `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n    *   Substituting `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`:\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n        `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        `600T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n*   **Method B (using total energies):**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** `E₁ + E₂ = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** `(pc)² = E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²`.\n    *   This leads to `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV`.\n    *   Solving the system `E₁ + E₂ = 300` and `E₁ - E₂ = 98.01` gives `E₁ = 199.005 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_correct = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\nBoth methods correctly yield `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the detailed calculations is that the difference in kinetic energy is **5 MeV**. The confusion in the provided answers stems from mapping this correct numerical result to the multiple-choice options. For the question as stated with the options:\nA) 5 MeV\nB) 20 MeV\nC) 10 MeV\nD) 2 MeV\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value\n\nFirst, we determine the properties of the two fragments resulting from the fission.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Fragment Mass Relations:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`) and that their combined mass is 99% of the original mass (`m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`).\n*   **Solving for Fragment Masses:**\n    *   Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`, so `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n    *   From this, we find the mass of the larger fragment: `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n*   **Calculating Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment is `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   **Calculating the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The energy released as kinetic energy (`Q`) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn the non-relativistic approximation, we use classical mechanics.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   **Kinetic Energy Ratio:** The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore `T₁/T₂ = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio `m₂/m₁ = 1/2`. This means `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV` => `3T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic formulas.\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²`:\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    *   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁,correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Finding the Difference\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct and classical values and convert it to MeV.\n\n*   **Difference in GeV:** `Difference = T₁,correct - T₁,classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   **Difference in MeV:** Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the difference is `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis result matches option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most perform the calculation correctly to arrive at 5 MeV, many then select the wrong letter. The correct calculation leads to 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV` is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m₁`, is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Sum:** The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\nWe can solve the system of equations for the masses:\n1.  Substitute `m₁ = 2m₂` into the sum equation: `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which gives `3m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  This yields `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  Consequently, `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n\nNow, we find their rest-mass energies based on the initial value `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\nThe energy released during fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nDue to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum for each fragment.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   Therefore, `p² = 2m₁T₁_class` and `p² = 2m₂T₂_class`, which implies `m₁T₁_class = m₂T₂_class`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁_class / T₂_class = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, so `T₂_class = 2 * T₁_class`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_class + T₂_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T₂_class`: `T₁_class + 2T₁_class = 3 GeV`, which means `3T₁_class = 3 GeV`.\n*   **`T₁_classical = 1 GeV`**.\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Mechanics\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc²`.\n*   This can be rearranged to find the momentum: `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), their squares are also equal: `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n*   Therefore: `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`.\n*   We know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`. We substitute this and the rest-mass energies (in GeV) into the equation:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding and simplifying:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   **`T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`**.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical value for T₁.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, we convert the answer to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV` is at rest. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The more massive fragment, `m₁`, is twice the mass of the lighter fragment, `m₂`. So, `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) using relativistic mechanics (the correct value) and classical mechanics (the approximation).\n\n### **2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies for the two fragments.\n1.  We have a system of two equations: `m₁ = 2m₂` and `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n2.  Substituting the first into the second gives `2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`, which simplifies to `3m₂ = 0.99M`, or `m₂ = 0.33M`.\n3.  From this, we find `m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`.\n4.  Now, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn non-relativistic mechanics, due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂ = p`).\n*   The kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁,cl / T₂,cl = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T₂,cl = 2 * T₁,cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁,cl + T₂,cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁,cl + 2*T₁,cl = 3 GeV`, which gives `3*T₁,cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the classical kinetic energy is `T₁,cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   This can be expressed in terms of kinetic energy `T` as `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`), we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding the terms:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We simplify the remaining equation:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Final Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nTo match the answer options, we convert this to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the provided solutions correctly perform the calculations and arrive at a numerical difference of 5 MeV. Several candidates then incorrectly map this result to the given options. The correct calculation yields 5 MeV, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
