  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA) C6H12O\nB) C6H10O\nC) C6H10O2\nD) C6H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this peak with the broad O-H stretch is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This is an explicit confirmation of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of an alkene.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺, is calculated as 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Conclusion from Mass Spec:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecule **must contain two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds).\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option C):**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This formula has two oxygen atoms and a DoU of 2. It is perfectly consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option D):**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This formula has two oxygen atoms but only one degree of unsaturation. It could represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot also have the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided data (an unsaturated carboxylic acid) is C6H10O2. This corresponds to option C in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broadness is due to the O-H stretch involved in strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, as these are protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Carbon=12 + Oxygen=16 + Oxygen=16 + Hydrogen=1 = 45).\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Findings\n\nCombining the data from all three techniques leads to a clear conclusion about the molecule's structure:\nThe unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It must contain both a -COOH group and a C=C group.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on the required structural features.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Oxygen Count**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₀O) and D (C₆H₁₂O).\n    *   We are left with **A) C₆H₁₀O₂** and **B) C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of pi bonds and rings. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   Our compound has a C=O double bond (one degree of unsaturation) and a C=C double bond (a second degree of unsaturation).\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining two options:\n*   **For B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n*   **For A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n\n1.  **Corroboration:** The evidence is strong because the key functional groups are confirmed by multiple techniques (e.g., the C=C bond is seen in both FTIR and NMR).\n2.  **Quantitative Check:** The DoU calculation is a critical quantitative step that definitively distinguishes between the final two options.\n3.  **Mapping:** The correct chemical formula is C₆H₁₀O₂. According to the options provided in the question, this corresponds to letter A. Many of the candidate answers correctly identified the formula but failed to map it to the correct letter from the prompt.\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:** I will break down the information from each technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n    *   **FTIR:**\n        *   A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n        *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this confirms the carboxylic acid.\n        *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), meaning the compound is an alkene.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   The presence of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n        *   A fragment at m/z = 45 is a diagnostic peak for the [COOH]⁺ fragment, providing definitive proof of a carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Findings:** The combined evidence from all three techniques points to a single conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means it must contain:\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has **two oxygen atoms** and one C=O double bond.\n    *   An alkene group (C=C), which has one C=C double bond.\n\n3.  **Establish Chemical Formula Requirements:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** The formula must contain exactly two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds. The C=O bond counts as one degree, and the C=C bond counts as another. Therefore, the correct formula must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:** I will now systematically check each option against these two requirements. I will use a Python script to formalize this evaluation process.\n    *   **A) C6H12O:** Fails (only 1 oxygen).\n    *   **B) C6H10O:** Fails (only 1 oxygen).\n    *   **C) C6H10O2:** Passes the oxygen count. Let's check DoU.\n    *   **D) C6H12O2:** Passes the oxygen count. Let's check DoU.\n\n5.  **Final Check with DoU Calculation:** The script will calculate the DoU for the two remaining options (C and D) and identify the one that has a DoU of 2.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data requirements to identify the correct chemical formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The options provided in the question\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H12O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H10O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze functional groups from spectroscopic data.\")\n    print(\"- FTIR (broad 3000 cm-1, 1700 cm-1) and Mass Spec (m/z=45) confirm a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\")\n    print(\"- FTIR (1650 cm-1) and 1H NMR (vinyl-H) confirm an alkene (C=C).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Determine requirements for the molecular formula.\")\n    print(\"- Requirement 1: Must contain 2 oxygen atoms (for the carboxylic acid).\")\n    print(\"- Requirement 2: Must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2 (one for C=O, one for C=C).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Evaluate each option against the requirements.\")\n    \n    final_answer = None\n    \n    for choice, formula in options.items():\n        # Extract C, H, and O counts from the formula string\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d*)', formula)\n        counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n        \n        c_count = counts.get('C', 0)\n        h_count = counts.get('H', 0)\n        o_count = counts.get('O', 0)\n\n        # Check Requirement 1: Oxygen count\n        oxygen_check = (o_count == 2)\n        \n        # Check Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n        # DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n        dou = c_count + 1 - (h_count / 2)\n        dou_check = (dou == 2)\n\n        print(f\"\\n- Evaluating Option {choice}: {formula}\")\n        print(f\"  - Oxygen atoms: {o_count}.

Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is a result of strong hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.

Synthesize the Data and Evaluate the Options**\n*   **Required Functional Groups:** The combined evidence from all three techniques confirms that the unknown compound must contain both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n*   **Requirement 1: Number of Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), as they only have one oxygen.\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n*   **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.

According to the question's list, this corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Evidence**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the most characteristic feature of an O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the C=O (carbonyl) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation provides definitive proof of an alkene functional group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Synthesize the Findings**\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound contains two key functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group.\n2.  An **alkene (C=C)** group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Candidate Formulas**\n\nWe can now use these findings to evaluate the given options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Oxygen Count**\n    A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This requirement immediately eliminates any options with a different number of oxygens.\n    *   A) C6H10O2 (2 Oxygens) - Possible\n    *   B) C6H10O (1 Oxygen) - **Eliminated**\n    *   C) C6H12O2 (2 Oxygens) - Possible\n    *   D) C6H12O (1 Oxygen) - **Eliminated**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule. Our evidence shows the molecule contains one C=O bond and one C=C bond, so it must have a DoU of exactly 2.\n    The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options.\n\n    *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is consistent with all the evidence.\n\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C bond that was clearly identified by FTIR and NMR. This formula is inconsistent with the evidence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that satisfies all the requirements derived from the spectroscopic data is C6H10O2. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\nThe FTIR data provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.

This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data\nThe mass spectrum provides information about the mass of the molecule and its fragments.\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group is strongly confirmed.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesis of Evidence and Evaluation of Options\nAll three analytical techniques consistently indicate that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This conclusion sets two key requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n\n1.  **It must contain two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n2.  **It must have at least two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**: one for the C=O double bond and one for the C=C double bond.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on these requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   Contains 2 oxygens (✓).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   Contains 2 oxygens (✓).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This DoU perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This option is consistent with all data.\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:**\n    *   Contains only 1 oxygen (✗). This cannot be a carboxylic acid. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:**\n    *   Contains only 1 oxygen (✗). This cannot be a carboxylic acid. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n*   The most critical point is to synthesize the data from all three techniques. The FTIR and Mass Spec data strongly point to a carboxylic acid, while the FTIR and NMR data confirm an alkene. The correct formula must satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n*   A common mistake is to miscalculate the Degree of Unsaturation or to ignore one of the functional groups. The formula C₆H₁₂O₂ is a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond.\n*   The only formula that has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation for both a C=O and a C=C bond is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\nBased on the prompt's list, the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum\nThe FTIR spectrum provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Vinyl hydrogens are those protons attached directly to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n**Careful Point:** This data corroborates the FTIR evidence for a C=C bond, making the presence of an alkene group certain.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum\nMass spectrometry provides information about the mass of the molecule and its fragments.\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is calculated as 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45.\n\n**Careful Point:** This fragment provides strong, independent evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group, reinforcing the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n\n1.  **Oxygen Requirement:** A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Requirement:** The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n3.  **Calculate DoU for the Remaining Options:** We are left with A (C6H12O2) and B (C6H10O2). The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **For A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid and does not allow for the C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly accommodates both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This option is correct.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided data—the presence of a carboxylic acid (two oxygens, one DoU) and an alkene (one DoU)—is C6H10O2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Peak 1: Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹.** This is a classic signature of an O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is a key feature that distinguishes it from a typically less broad alcohol O-H peak.\n    *   **Peak 2: Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹.** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the existence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Peak 3: Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹.** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** provides unambiguous confirmation of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence. This mass corresponds to the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺ (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This strongly corroborates the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Synthesis of Evidence and Evaluation of Options\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must satisfy two key criteria:\n1.  It must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which means it must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  It must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**: one for the C=O double bond in the acid and one for the C=C double bond of the alkene.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these criteria. The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** Contains only one oxygen atom. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C6H10O2:** Contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This formula has the correct number of oxygens and the correct degree of unsaturation to account for both a C=O and a C=C bond. This is a perfect match.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** Contains only one oxygen atom. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C6H12O2:** Contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of a carboxylic acid, implying a saturated molecule. This contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond from FTIR and NMR.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Interpreting \"Broad Peak\":** The description \"very broad\" for the peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is crucial. While alcohols also show broad O-H peaks, the one for a carboxylic acid is typically much broader and centered lower, overlapping the C-H stretch region.\n*   **Corroborating Evidence:** No single piece of data is sufficient. The conclusion is strong because the FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spec data all independently support the presence of the same functional groups (carboxylic acid and alkene).\n*   **The Role of DoU:** The Degree of Unsaturation is the key calculation that allows for the final differentiation between the two formulas containing two oxygen atoms (C6H10O2 and C6H12O2).\n*   **Matching Formula to Option:** It is essential to correctly map the derived chemical formula (C6H10O2) back to the corresponding lettered option from the question, which is B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence—an unsaturated carboxylic acid—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Functional Groups from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating an **alkene**.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The presence of **vinyl-hydrogens** explicitly confirms the existence of a **C=C double bond**, corroborating the FTIR data.\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques points unambiguously to a molecule that is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It must contain both a -COOH group and a C=C group.\n\n### **2. Evaluating the Candidate Formulas**\n\nNow, we apply two key constraints derived from our analysis to the given options:\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Number of Oxygen Atoms**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates any options with only one oxygen.\n    *   A) C6H12O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n    *   B) C6H10O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n    *   We are left with C) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. Let's calculate this for the remaining options.\n\n    *   **For C) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for both the C=O and C=C double bonds. **This is a match.**\n\n    *   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by the FTIR and NMR data. **This is incorrect.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information and candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Evidence\n\nThe core of this problem is to interpret the data from three different analytical techniques. All candidate answers correctly identify the meaning of each piece of data.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This combination is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broadness is due to the O-H stretch involved in hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** This explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, as vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence\n\nCombining the data from all three techniques leads to a clear conclusion about the structure's required features:\n1.  The compound **must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  The compound **must contain an alkene group (C=C)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we use these two requirements to evaluate the given options.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Must be a carboxylic acid.**\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates any formulas with only one oxygen.\n    *   `C6H12O` (Option C) is eliminated.\n    *   `C6H10O` (Option D) is eliminated.\n    *   The only remaining possibilities are `C6H10O2` (Option A) and `C6H12O2` (Option B).\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Must contain a C=C double bond in addition to the C=O bond.**\n    *   This means the molecule must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**: one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the two remaining options:\n        *   **For C6H12O2 (Option B):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It cannot also have a C=C bond. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n        *   **For C6H10O2 (Option A):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This option is consistent with all the evidence.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe only chemical formula that satisfies all the conditions derived from the spectroscopic data is **C6H10O2**. According to the question's list, this corresponds to option A.\n\n**Careful Point:** A review of the candidate answers shows that while almost all of them correctly deduce the formula to be C6H10O2, many of them select the wrong corresponding letter (e.g., choosing 'C' or 'D'). The reasoning is sound, but the final mapping is often incorrect. Based on the provided question format, C6H10O2 is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Data:** A very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and a strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The very broad peak centered around 3000 cm⁻¹ is the classic signature of an O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position, combined with the broad O-H, confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating an **alkene** functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Data:** Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens were observed.\n*   **Interpretation:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** This data definitively confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n*   **Data:** A fragment peak at m/z = 45.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is calculated as: 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45.\n*   **Conclusion from Mass Spec:** This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options**\nThe combined data from all three techniques points to a single conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must satisfy two key criteria:\n1.  It must contain a carboxylic acid group, which requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  It must contain both a C=O double bond (from the acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene), requiring a total **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given formulas based on these two criteria. The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygens: 1. Fails.\n*   **B) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygens: 1. Fails.\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygens: 2. **Passes.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. **Passes.**\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygens: 2. **Passes.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. Fails (This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The evidence for the carboxylic acid is very strong, coming from three independent pieces of data (FTIR O-H, FTIR C=O, and MS fragment). This makes the requirement for two oxygen atoms non-negotiable.\n*   The evidence for the alkene is also very strong, coming from two independent pieces of data (FTIR C=C and NMR vinyl-H). This makes the requirement for a second degree of unsaturation (in addition to the one from the C=O) non-negotiable.\n*   The only formula that satisfies all requirements is C6H10O2. It is crucial to correctly map this formula back to the options provided in the question. C6H10O2 is listed as option C.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe chemical formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data, as it contains the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and has the two degrees of unsaturation required to account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and the spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Evidence\n\nThe core of the problem lies in correctly interpreting the data from the three analytical techniques. All candidate answers correctly identify the meaning of each piece of data.\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ & Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This combination is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group. The broadness of the O-H stretch is due to strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** This explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment corresponding to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nThis conclusion imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** It must contain **two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** It must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**. One DoU is for the C=O double bond in the acid, and the second DoU is for the C=C double bond of the alkene.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options Against the Requirements\n\nNow, we evaluate the four original options based on these two requirements. The formula for Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Fails.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2.\n\n*   **B) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. **Passes.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. **Passes.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n*   **C) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. **Passes.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. **Fails.** The DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the acid, not the additional C=C bond.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Fails.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1.\n\n### Careful Point: Consistency of Candidate Answers\n\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly deduce that the formula must be C6H10O2. However, they differ in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is because many of them reordered the options in their own text, leading to an answer that is internally consistent but does not map back to the original question's lettering. The correct approach is to identify the correct formula (C6H10O2) and then find its corresponding letter in the original list provided in the question prompt.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. According to the original question's list, this corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a definitive characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.

This strongly supports the presence of a -COOH group.\n\n### Synthesizing the Evidence and Evaluating the Options\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques consistently indicate that the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Oxygen Count**\nA carboxylic acid functional group requires **two oxygen atoms**. This allows us to immediately eliminate two of the options:\n*   C) C6H12O (one oxygen)\n*   D) C6H10O (one oxygen)\n\nWe are left with A) C6H12O2 and B) C6H10O2.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule. We can calculate it from the molecular formula and also determine the required DoU from the identified functional groups.\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   The C=C double bond in the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\nNow, we calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For A) C6H12O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    This DoU of 1 is insufficient.

Looking at the original list of options provided in the question:\nA) C6H12O2\nB) C6H10O2\nC) C6H12O\nD) C6H10O\n\nThe correct formula, C6H10O2, corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n*   **Peak 1: Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹.** This is a classic signature of an O-H stretching vibration that is involved in strong hydrogen bonding. The extreme broadness, centered around the C-H stretching region, is highly characteristic of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n*   **Peak 2: Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹.** This peak is located in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, provides strong confirmation of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Peak 3: Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹.** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene** functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Observation: Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens.** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Mass Spectrum\n*   **Observation: Fragment peak at m/z = 45.** This is a highly diagnostic fragment.

A **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  An **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nWe can now evaluate the given options based on these requirements.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Oxygen Count.** A carboxylic acid functional group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), as they only contain one oxygen atom. We are left with A (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU represents the total number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For option C (C6H12O2):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C bond confirmed by both FTIR and NMR. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **For option A (C6H10O2):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O double bond and the C=C double bond. This formula is consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic evidence.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only chemical formula that satisfies all the requirements—containing two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and having two degrees of unsaturation for the carbonyl and alkene groups—is C6H10O2. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point 1: Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹.** A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is the definitive signature of an O-H stretch within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding. This is a more specific identification than just an alcohol.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Peak at 1700 cm⁻¹.** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence alongside the very broad O-H peak confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an **alkene**.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### **2.

Synthesis and Evaluation of Options**\nBased on the combined data, the unknown compound must satisfy two key criteria:\n1.  It must be a **carboxylic acid**, which means its chemical formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  It must contain both a C=O double bond (from the acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene). This requires a **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options from the prompt:\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Contains 2 oxygen atoms (Consistent).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\nThe FTIR spectrum provides information about the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n*   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broadness of the O-H stretch (around 3000 cm⁻¹) is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and the peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n*   A **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum gives information about the different types of protons in the molecule.\n*   The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** is an explicit confirmation of the C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons that are directly attached to the carbon atoms of an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** This data corroborates the FTIR evidence, confirming the compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\nMass spectrometry provides the mass-to-charge ratio of the molecule and its fragments.\n*   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **Step 4: Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options**\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound must contain two key functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group.\n2.  An **alkene (C=C)** group.\n\nThese structural features impose two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n*   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** A carboxylic acid group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n*   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. The C=O bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation, and the C=C bond accounts for a second. Therefore, the molecule must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\nWe now calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n*   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond and does not allow for the C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n*   **For C) C6H10O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This option is correct.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n*   **Corroborating Evidence:** The conclusion is very strong because the key functional groups are confirmed by multiple techniques. The carboxylic acid is supported by FTIR and Mass Spectrometry, while the alkene is supported by FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n*   **Specificity of Data:** The \"very broad\" nature of the 3000 cm⁻¹ peak is crucial for identifying a carboxylic acid over an alcohol. The m/z = 45 fragment is also highly specific.\n*   **The Role of DoU:** The Degree of Unsaturation is the critical quantitative check that definitively distinguishes between C6H10O2 and C6H12O2, both of which have the correct number of oxygen atoms.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** It is essential to correctly map the derived formula (C6H10O2) back to the original list of options provided in the prompt. In this case, C6H10O2 corresponds to option C.\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared an unknown compound.

Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA) C6H12O\nB) C6H10O\nC) C6H10O2\nD) C6H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this peak with the broad O-H stretch is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This is an explicit confirmation of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of an alkene.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺, is calculated as 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Conclusion from Mass Spec:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecule **must contain two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds).\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option C):**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This formula has two oxygen atoms and a DoU of 2. It is perfectly consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option D):**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This formula has two oxygen atoms but only one degree of unsaturation. It could represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it cannot also have the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided data (an unsaturated carboxylic acid) is C6H10O2. This corresponds to option C in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe first step is to interpret the evidence from each analytical technique.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broadness is due to the O-H stretch involved in strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, as these are protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Carbon=12 + Oxygen=16 + Oxygen=16 + Hydrogen=1 = 45).\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Findings\n\nCombining the data from all three techniques leads to a clear conclusion about the molecule's structure:\nThe unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It must contain both a -COOH group and a C=C group.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on the required structural features.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Oxygen Count**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₀O) and D (C₆H₁₂O).\n    *   We are left with **A) C₆H₁₀O₂** and **B) C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of pi bonds and rings. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   Our compound has a C=O double bond (one degree of unsaturation) and a C=C double bond (a second degree of unsaturation).\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining two options:\n*   **For B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n*   **For A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n\n1.  **Corroboration:** The evidence is strong because the key functional groups are confirmed by multiple techniques (e.g., the C=C bond is seen in both FTIR and NMR).\n2.  **Quantitative Check:** The DoU calculation is a critical quantitative step that definitively distinguishes between the final two options.\n3.  **Mapping:** The correct chemical formula is C₆H₁₀O₂. According to the options provided in the question, this corresponds to letter A. Many of the candidate answers correctly identified the formula but failed to map it to the correct letter from the prompt.\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:** I will break down the information from each technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n    *   **FTIR:**\n        *   A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n        *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this confirms the carboxylic acid.\n        *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), meaning the compound is an alkene.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   The presence of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n        *   A fragment at m/z = 45 is a diagnostic peak for the [COOH]⁺ fragment, providing definitive proof of a carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Findings:** The combined evidence from all three techniques points to a single conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means it must contain:\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has **two oxygen atoms** and one C=O double bond.\n    *   An alkene group (C=C), which has one C=C double bond.\n\n3.  **Establish Chemical Formula Requirements:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** The formula must contain exactly two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds. The C=O bond counts as one degree, and the C=C bond counts as another. Therefore, the correct formula must have a **DoU of 2**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:** I will now systematically check each option against these two requirements. I will use a Python script to formalize this evaluation process.\n    *   **A) C6H12O:** Fails (only 1 oxygen).\n    *   **B) C6H10O:** Fails (only 1 oxygen).\n    *   **C) C6H10O2:** Passes the oxygen count.

Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Evidence**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the most characteristic feature of an O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the C=O (carbonyl) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation provides definitive proof of an alkene functional group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Synthesize the Findings**\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound contains two key functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group.\n2.  An **alkene (C=C)** group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Candidate Formulas**\n\nWe can now use these findings to evaluate the given options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Oxygen Count**\n    A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This requirement immediately eliminates any options with a different number of oxygens.\n    *   A) C6H10O2 (2 Oxygens) - Possible\n    *   B) C6H10O (1 Oxygen) - **Eliminated**\n    *   C) C6H12O2 (2 Oxygens) - Possible\n    *   D) C6H12O (1 Oxygen) - **Eliminated**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule. Our evidence shows the molecule contains one C=O bond and one C=C bond, so it must have a DoU of exactly 2.\n    The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options.\n\n    *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is consistent with all the evidence.\n\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C bond that was clearly identified by FTIR and NMR. This formula is inconsistent with the evidence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that satisfies all the requirements derived from the spectroscopic data is C6H10O2. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\nThe FTIR data provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this peak with the broad O-H stretch is a definitive indicator of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\nThe ¹H NMR data provides information about the hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data\nThe mass spectrum provides information about the mass of the molecule and its fragments.\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺.

This conclusion sets two key requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n\n1.  **It must contain two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n2.  **It must have at least two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**: one for the C=O double bond and one for the C=C double bond.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on these requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   Contains 2 oxygens (✓).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   Contains 2 oxygens (✓).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This DoU perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This option is consistent with all data.\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:**\n    *   Contains only 1 oxygen (✗). This cannot be a carboxylic acid. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:**\n    *   Contains only 1 oxygen (✗). This cannot be a carboxylic acid. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n*   The most critical point is to synthesize the data from all three techniques. The FTIR and Mass Spec data strongly point to a carboxylic acid, while the FTIR and NMR data confirm an alkene. The correct formula must satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n*   A common mistake is to miscalculate the Degree of Unsaturation or to ignore one of the functional groups. The formula C₆H₁₂O₂ is a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond.\n*   The only formula that has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation for both a C=O and a C=C bond is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\nBased on the prompt's list, the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum\nThe FTIR spectrum provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating an alkene.\n\n**Careful Point:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch centered around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a C=O stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum gives information about the hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This is a direct confirmation of the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those protons attached directly to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n**Careful Point:** This data corroborates the FTIR evidence for a C=C bond, making the presence of an alkene group certain.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum\nMass spectrometry provides information about the mass of the molecule and its fragments.\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is calculated as 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45.\n\n**Careful Point:** This fragment provides strong, independent evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group, reinforcing the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n\n1.  **Oxygen Requirement:** A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Requirement:** The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n3.  **Calculate DoU for the Remaining Options:** We are left with A (C6H12O2) and B (C6H10O2). The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **For A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid and does not allow for the C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly accommodates both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This option is correct.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided data—the presence of a carboxylic acid (two oxygens, one DoU) and an alkene (one DoU)—is C6H10O2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Peak 1: Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹.** This is a classic signature of an O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is a key feature that distinguishes it from a typically less broad alcohol O-H peak.\n    *   **Peak 2: Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹.** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly confirms the existence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Peak 3: Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹.** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of **peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens** provides unambiguous confirmation of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence. This mass corresponds to the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺ (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This strongly corroborates the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Synthesis of Evidence and Evaluation of Options\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must satisfy two key criteria:\n1.  It must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which means it must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  It must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**: one for the C=O double bond in the acid and one for the C=C double bond of the alkene.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these criteria. The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** Contains only one oxygen atom. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C6H10O2:** Contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This formula has the correct number of oxygens and the correct degree of unsaturation to account for both a C=O and a C=C bond. This is a perfect match.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** Contains only one oxygen atom. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C6H12O2:** Contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of a carboxylic acid, implying a saturated molecule. This contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond from FTIR and NMR.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Interpreting \"Broad Peak\":** The description \"very broad\" for the peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is crucial. While alcohols also show broad O-H peaks, the one for a carboxylic acid is typically much broader and centered lower, overlapping the C-H stretch region.\n*   **Corroborating Evidence:** No single piece of data is sufficient. The conclusion is strong because the FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spec data all independently support the presence of the same functional groups (carboxylic acid and alkene).\n*   **The Role of DoU:** The Degree of Unsaturation is the key calculation that allows for the final differentiation between the two formulas containing two oxygen atoms (C6H10O2 and C6H12O2).\n*   **Matching Formula to Option:** It is essential to correctly map the derived chemical formula (C6H10O2) back to the corresponding lettered option from the question, which is B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence—an unsaturated carboxylic acid—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Functional Groups from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating an **alkene**.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The presence of **vinyl-hydrogens** explicitly confirms the existence of a **C=C double bond**, corroborating the FTIR data.\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n**Conclusion from Data Synthesis:** The combined evidence from all three techniques points unambiguously to a molecule that is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It must contain both a -COOH group and a C=C group.\n\n### **2. Evaluating the Candidate Formulas**\n\nNow, we apply two key constraints derived from our analysis to the given options:\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Number of Oxygen Atoms**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates any options with only one oxygen.\n    *   A) C6H12O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n    *   B) C6H10O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n    *   We are left with C) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. Let's calculate this for the remaining options.\n\n    *   **For C) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for both the C=O and C=C double bonds. **This is a match.**\n\n    *   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by the FTIR and NMR data. **This is incorrect.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information and candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Evidence\n\nThe core of this problem is to interpret the data from three different analytical techniques. All candidate answers correctly identify the meaning of each piece of data.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This combination is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broadness is due to the O-H stretch involved in hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** This explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, as vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ ion (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence\n\nCombining the data from all three techniques leads to a clear conclusion about the structure's required features:\n1.  The compound **must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  The compound **must contain an alkene group (C=C)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we use these two requirements to evaluate the given options.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Must be a carboxylic acid.**\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates any formulas with only one oxygen.\n    *   `C6H12O` (Option C) is eliminated.\n    *   `C6H10O` (Option D) is eliminated.\n    *   The only remaining possibilities are `C6H10O2` (Option A) and `C6H12O2` (Option B).\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Must contain a C=C double bond in addition to the C=O bond.**\n    *   This means the molecule must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**: one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the two remaining options:\n        *   **For C6H12O2 (Option B):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It cannot also have a C=C bond. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n        *   **For C6H10O2 (Option A):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This option is consistent with all the evidence.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe only chemical formula that satisfies all the conditions derived from the spectroscopic data is **C6H10O2**. According to the question's list, this corresponds to option A.\n\n**Careful Point:** A review of the candidate answers shows that while almost all of them correctly deduce the formula to be C6H10O2, many of them select the wrong corresponding letter (e.g., choosing 'C' or 'D'). The reasoning is sound, but the final mapping is often incorrect. Based on the provided question format, C6H10O2 is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Data:** A very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and a strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The very broad peak centered around 3000 cm⁻¹ is the classic signature of an O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position, combined with the broad O-H, confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating an **alkene** functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Data:** Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens were observed.\n*   **Interpretation:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** This data definitively confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n*   **Data:** A fragment peak at m/z = 45.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) is calculated as: 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45.\n*   **Conclusion from Mass Spec:** This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options**\nThe combined data from all three techniques points to a single conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must satisfy two key criteria:\n1.  It must contain a carboxylic acid group, which requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  It must contain both a C=O double bond (from the acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene), requiring a total **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given formulas based on these two criteria. The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygens: 1. Fails.\n*   **B) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygens: 1. Fails.\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygens: 2. **Passes.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. **Passes.**\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygens: 2. **Passes.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. Fails (This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The evidence for the carboxylic acid is very strong, coming from three independent pieces of data (FTIR O-H, FTIR C=O, and MS fragment). This makes the requirement for two oxygen atoms non-negotiable.\n*   The evidence for the alkene is also very strong, coming from two independent pieces of data (FTIR C=C and NMR vinyl-H). This makes the requirement for a second degree of unsaturation (in addition to the one from the C=O) non-negotiable.\n*   The only formula that satisfies all requirements is C6H10O2. It is crucial to correctly map this formula back to the options provided in the question. C6H10O2 is listed as option C.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe chemical formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data, as it contains the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and has the two degrees of unsaturation required to account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and the spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Evidence\n\nThe core of the problem lies in correctly interpreting the data from the three analytical techniques. All candidate answers correctly identify the meaning of each piece of data.\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ & Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This combination is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group. The broadness of the O-H stretch is due to strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** This explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment corresponding to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** and an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nThis conclusion imposes two strict requirements on the correct molecular formula:\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** It must contain **two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** It must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**. One DoU is for the C=O double bond in the acid, and the second DoU is for the C=C double bond of the alkene.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options Against the Requirements\n\nNow, we evaluate the four original options based on these two requirements. The formula for Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Fails.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2.\n\n*   **B) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. **Passes.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. **Passes.** This formula perfectly accommodates both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n*   **C) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. **Passes.**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. **Fails.** The DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the acid, not the additional C=C bond.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Fails.** Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1.\n\n### Careful Point: Consistency of Candidate Answers\n\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly deduce that the formula must be C6H10O2. However, they differ in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is because many of them reordered the options in their own text, leading to an answer that is internally consistent but does not map back to the original question's lettering. The correct approach is to identify the correct formula (C6H10O2) and then find its corresponding letter in the original list provided in the question prompt.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. According to the original question's list, this corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a definitive characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This is an explicit confirmation of the C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond, providing corroborating evidence for the alkene group suggested by the FTIR.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This strongly supports the presence of a -COOH group.\n\n### Synthesizing the Evidence and Evaluating the Options\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques consistently indicate that the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Oxygen Count**\nA carboxylic acid functional group requires **two oxygen atoms**. This allows us to immediately eliminate two of the options:\n*   C) C6H12O (one oxygen)\n*   D) C6H10O (one oxygen)\n\nWe are left with A) C6H12O2 and B) C6H10O2.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule. We can calculate it from the molecular formula and also determine the required DoU from the identified functional groups.\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   The C=C double bond in the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\nNow, we calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For A) C6H12O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    This DoU of 1 is insufficient. It can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid, but not the C=C bond of the alkene.\n\n*   **For B) C6H10O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Matching the Conclusion to the Options**\nThe analysis shows that the only formula consistent with all the data is **C6H10O2**. Looking at the original list of options provided in the question:\nA) C6H12O2\nB) C6H10O2\nC) C6H12O\nD) C6H10O\n\nThe correct formula, C6H10O2, corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n*   **Peak 1: Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹.** This is a classic signature of an O-H stretching vibration that is involved in strong hydrogen bonding. The extreme broadness, centered around the C-H stretching region, is highly characteristic of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n*   **Peak 2: Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹.** This peak is located in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, provides strong confirmation of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Peak 3: Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹.** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene** functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Observation: Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens.** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Mass Spectrum\n*   **Observation: Fragment peak at m/z = 45.** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺, is calculated as approximately 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45 amu.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group is strongly confirmed.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on the combined analysis, the unknown compound must possess two key features:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  An **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nWe can now evaluate the given options based on these requirements.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Oxygen Count.** A carboxylic acid functional group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), as they only contain one oxygen atom. We are left with A (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU represents the total number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For option C (C6H12O2):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C bond confirmed by both FTIR and NMR. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **For option A (C6H10O2):**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O double bond and the C=C double bond. This formula is consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic evidence.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only chemical formula that satisfies all the requirements—containing two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and having two degrees of unsaturation for the carbonyl and alkene groups—is C6H10O2. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point 1: Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹.** A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is the definitive signature of an O-H stretch within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding. This is a more specific identification than just an alcohol.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Peak at 1700 cm⁻¹.** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence alongside the very broad O-H peak confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an **alkene**.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point 4: Vinyl-hydrogens.** The prompt explicitly states the presence of vinyl-hydrogens. This is unambiguous proof of a **C=C double bond**, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains an alkene group.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n*   **Careful Point 5: Fragment at m/z = 45.** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺, is calculated as 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. This provides strong, independent confirmation of the **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Options**\nBased on the combined data, the unknown compound must satisfy two key criteria:\n1.  It must be a **carboxylic acid**, which means its chemical formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  It must contain both a C=O double bond (from the acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene). This requires a **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options from the prompt:\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Contains 2 oxygen atoms (Consistent).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. (Consistent).\n*   **B) C6H12O:**\n    *   Contains only 1 oxygen atom (Inconsistent).\n*   **C) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Contains 2 oxygen atoms (Consistent).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. (Inconsistent, this only accounts for the C=O bond, not the C=C bond).\n*   **D) C6H10O:**\n    *   Contains only 1 oxygen atom (Inconsistent).\n\n### **Final Decision**\nOnly the chemical formula **C6H10O2** is consistent with all the evidence provided by the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to have both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
