A comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the mathematical method and the numerical result, although there are inconsistencies in matching the result to the correct letter option. The following is a definitive, synthesized analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Definition**: The task is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`, which is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n    *   **Vector Field `f`**: The field is purely radial with a magnitude that follows an inverse-square law, `|f| = 1/r²`. In vector notation, this is `f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   **Volume `V`**: The integration volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Method Selection**: The correct and most efficient method, as identified by all candidate answers, is the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    This approach is essential because it correctly handles the singularity of the vector field at the origin.\n\n3.  **Calculation using the Divergence Theorem**: The problem is solved by calculating the surface integral (flux) on the right-hand side of the theorem.\n    *   **Field on the Surface**: On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is a constant value `R`. The vector field on this surface is `f(R) = (1/R²) * r̂`.\n    *   **Differential Surface Element**: For a sphere, the differential surface area vector `dS` points in the outward normal direction, which is the radial direction (`r̂`). In spherical coordinates, its vector form is `dS = (R² * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂`.\n    *   **Dot Product**: The dot product `f ⋅ dS` is calculated:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R²) * r̂] ⋅ [(R² * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂]`\n        The `R²` terms cancel out, and since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`. The expression simplifies significantly to:\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    *   **Integration**: This simplified expression is integrated over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle `θ` are `0` to `π`, and for the azimuthal angle `φ` are `0` to `2π`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n        This integral is separable:\n        `= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n        Evaluating each part:\n        *   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n        *   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n    *   **Final Result**: The total flux is the product of these two results: `(2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: By the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the calculated flux. Therefore, the value of the integral is `4π`. Matching this result to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 1\n    B) 4 π\n    C) 0\n    D) 4/3 π R\nThe calculated value `4π` corresponds to option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Singularity at the Origin**: This is the most critical aspect of the problem. The vector field `f(r)` is singular (its magnitude is infinite) at the origin (`r=0`), which is contained within the volume of integration.\n*   **The Pitfall of Direct Calculation**: A direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` gives `0` for all points *except* the origin (`r ≠ 0`). A common and serious mistake is to assume the integral is therefore zero. This is incorrect because it ignores the non-zero contribution from the singularity, which acts as a point source.\n*   **The Power of the Divergence Theorem**: The theorem is the correct tool because it correctly accounts for the \"source\" at the singularity within the volume by evaluating the field's total flux on the boundary surface, where the field is well-defined.\n*   **Independence from Radius R**: The final result, `4π`, is a constant and does not depend on the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`). This is a fundamental property of inverse-square fields and is demonstrated when the `R²` terms for the field's magnitude and the surface area element cancel each other out.\n*   **Physical Analogy (Gauss's Law)**: This problem is mathematically identical to using Gauss's Law in electrostatics to find the electric flux from a point charge located at the origin. The non-zero result signifies the presence of a \"source\" inside the volume.\n*   **The Dirac Delta Function**: A more formal mathematical treatment shows that the divergence of this field is not zero everywhere but is actually `∇ ⋅ (r̂ / r²) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. The integral of this expression over any volume containing the origin is precisely `4π`, confirming the result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a classic problem in vector calculus, and the candidate answers provide a unanimous and correct approach.

A comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the mathematical method and the numerical result, although there are inconsistencies in matching the result to the correct letter option. The following is a definitive, synthesized analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Definition**: The task is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`, which is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n    *   **Vector Field `f`**: The field is purely radial with a magnitude that follows an inverse-square law, `|f| = 1/r²`.

This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    This approach is essential because it correctly handles the singularity of the vector field at the origin.\n\n3.  **Calculation using the Divergence Theorem**: The problem is solved by calculating the surface integral (flux) on the right-hand side of the theorem.\n    *   **Field on the Surface**: On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is a constant value `R`. The vector field on this surface is `f(R) = (1/R²) * r̂`.\n    *   **Differential Surface Element**: For a sphere, the differential surface area vector `dS` points in the outward normal direction, which is the radial direction (`r̂`). In spherical coordinates, its vector form is `dS = (R² * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂`.\n    *   **Dot Product**: The dot product `f ⋅ dS` is calculated:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R²) * r̂] ⋅ [(R² * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r̂]`\n        The `R²` terms cancel out, and since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`. The expression simplifies significantly to:\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    *   **Integration**: This simplified expression is integrated over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle `θ` are `0` to `π`, and for the azimuthal angle `φ` are `0` to `2π`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n        This integral is separable:\n        `= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n        Evaluating each part:\n        *   `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n        *   `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n    *   **Final Result**: The total flux is the product of these two results: `(2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: By the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the calculated flux.
