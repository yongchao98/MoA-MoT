Therefore, the correct approach is to follow the unanimous derivation and match the result to the options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Goal and Core Assumption**: The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with parallax (`plx`). In mathematical terms, this is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars. The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space, meaning the number of stars per unit volume, the stellar density `ρ`, is a constant.\n\n2.  **Count Stars in a Distance Shell**: The most direct method is to count the number of stars (`dN`) within a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer.\n    *   Let the shell have a radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: The question requires the answer in terms of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). The standard astronomical definition relates parallax to distance inversely:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables (The Crucial Step)**: To get the answer in terms of parallax, we must convert the expression for `dN` from distance coordinates (`d`, `dd`) to parallax coordinates (`plx`, `d(plx)`). This requires two substitutions.\n    *   **Substitution 1 (for `d²`)**: The `d²` term, which comes from the surface area of the shell, becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution 2 (for `dd`)**: We must relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to a corresponding range in parallax `d(plx)`. This is done by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars in a positive interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Find the Final Proportionality**: Now, we substitute both parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * |d(plx)| )`\n    *   Combining the terms gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Derive the Final Answer**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. By rearranging the equation from the previous step, we get:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the final relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Correct Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the quantity requested: the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`). The other options represent common mistakes.\n    *   `~ 1/plx³` corresponds to the *cumulative* number of stars out to a certain parallax (`N(plx)`).\n    *   `~ 1/plx²` corresponds to the number of stars *per unit distance* (`dN/dd`). This is a common error where the second parallax factor is forgotten.\n    *   `~ 1/plx¹` does not correspond to a simple physical quantity in this problem.\n\n2.  **The Two Factors of `1/plx²`**: The final `1/plx⁴` dependency is not trivial and arises from two distinct effects. Forgetting the second is the most common conceptual error.\n    *   **Geometric Factor (`1/plx²`)**: The volume of space in a shell at distance `d` grows with the surface area, `4πd²`. This contributes the first `1/plx²` factor.\n    *   **Interval Mapping Factor / Jacobian (`1/plx²`)**: The relationship between a distance interval `dd` and a parallax interval `d(plx)` is non-linear. A fixed parallax interval corresponds to a much larger distance interval for more distant stars (smaller parallaxes). This change of variables for the differential element contributes the second `1/plx²` factor.\n\n3.  **Consensus on Derivation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the mathematical derivation and arrive at the `1/plx⁴` relationship. This shows an overwhelming consensus on the correct physics and mathematics. The variation in their final letter choices is an artifact of the experimental setup and should be disregarded in favor of the robustly derived physical law.\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct derivation, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.

The variation in the final letter choices among the candidates is due to the options being presented in a different, randomized order to each one, not due to any disagreement on the physics. The correct approach, therefore, is to follow the consensus derivation and match it to the options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Goal and Core Assumption**: The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with parallax (`plx`). In mathematical terms, this is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars. The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space, meaning the number of stars per unit volume (the stellar density, `ρ`) is a constant.\n\n2.  **Count Stars in a Distance Shell**: The most direct method is to count the number of stars (`dN`) within a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer.\n    *   Let the shell have a radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: The question requires the answer in terms of parallax, not distance. Parallax is defined as being inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables**: This is the most critical step. The expression for `dN` must be converted from distance coordinates (`d`, `dd`) to parallax coordinates (`plx`, `d(plx)`). This requires two substitutions:\n    *   **Substitution for `d²`**: The `d²` term, which comes from the surface area of the shell, becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution for `dd`**: We must relate the distance interval `dd` to the parallax interval `d(plx)`. This is done by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars in a positive interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Find the Final Proportionality**: Now, we substitute both parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    *   Combining the terms gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Derive the Final Answer**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. By rearranging the equation from the previous step, we get:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the final relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Correct Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the quantity requested: the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`). Common mistakes involve solving for related but incorrect quantities, such as the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dd ∝ d² ∝ 1/plx²`) or the cumulative number of stars within a certain distance (`N ∝ d³ ∝ 1/plx³`). These correspond to options C and A, respectively.\n*   **The Two Factors of `1/plx²`**: The final `1/plx⁴` dependency arises from two distinct and equally important sources. Forgetting either one is the most common conceptual error in this derivation.\n    1.  **Geometric Factor**: The surface area of the spherical shell grows as `d²`, which contributes a `1/plx²` factor. This is because more distant shells are vastly larger.\n    2.  **Interval Mapping Factor (Jacobian)**: The conversion from a distance interval `dd` to a parallax interval `d(plx)` is non-linear. A fixed parallax interval corresponds to a much larger distance interval for more distant stars (smaller parallax). This change of variables for the differential element contributes the second `1/plx²` factor.\n*   **Consensus on Derivation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the mathematical derivation, arriving at the `1/plx⁴` relationship. This shows an extremely strong consensus on the correct physics and calculus. The variation in their final letter choices is an artifact of the experimental setup and should be disregarded in favor of the robustly derived physical law.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently and robustly shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`. Matching this result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) ~ 1/plx^3\nB) ~ 1/plx^4\nC) ~ 1/plx^2\nD) ~ 1/plx^1\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the provided candidate answers to find the consensus on the physical derivation.

In mathematical terms, if `N` is the number of stars, we need to find the proportionality for the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space, meaning the number of stars per unit volume, the stellar density `ρ`, is a constant.\n\n2.  **Count Stars in a Distance Shell**: The most direct method is to count the number of stars (`dN`) within a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer.\n    *   Let the shell have a radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: The question requires the answer in terms of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). The standard astronomical definition relates parallax to distance inversely:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables**: This is the most critical step in the derivation. We must convert the expression for `dN`, which is in terms of distance (`d`, `dd`), into an expression in terms of parallax (`plx`, `d(plx)`). This requires two separate substitutions.\n    *   **Substitution 1 (for `d²`)**: The `d²` term, which comes from the surface area of the shell, becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution 2 (for `dd`)**: We must relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to a corresponding range in parallax `d(plx)`. This is done by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars in a positive interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Find the Final Proportionality**: Now, we substitute both parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * d² * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * |d(plx)| )`\n    *   Combining the terms gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. By rearranging the equation from the previous step, we get:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the final relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Target Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the correct quantity. The question asks for the *density* of stars in parallax space (`dN/d(plx)`), not the cumulative number of stars up to a certain distance (`N ∝ d³ ∝ 1/plx³`) or the density of stars in distance space (`dN/dd ∝ d² ∝ 1/plx²`).\n2.  **The Two Factors of `1/plx²`**: The final `1/plx⁴` dependency comes from two distinct sources.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are artifacts of the experimental setup, where the options were presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The core reasoning, however, is identical and robust across all responses.\n\nThe following is a definitive step-by-step derivation based on this consensus reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Goal and Core Assumption**: The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\". In mathematical terms, if `N` is the number of stars and `plx` is the parallax, we need to find the proportionality for the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, the stellar density (`ρ`), is a constant.\n\n2.  **Count Stars in a Distance Shell**: We consider the number of stars (`dN`) within a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer. Let the shell have a radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). The number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the constant density (`ρ`) times the volume: `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: Parallax (`plx`) is defined as being inversely proportional to distance (`d`). The standard formula is `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables (The Crucial Step)**: To get the answer in terms of parallax, we must substitute for both the `d²` term and the `dd` term.\n    *   **Substitution for `d²`**: Since `d = 1/plx`, the `d²` term becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution for `dd`**: We must relate the distance interval `dd` to the parallax interval `d(plx)`. This is done by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`.\n        For counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Find the Final Proportionality**: Now we substitute the parallax expressions from Step 4 into the equation from Step 2:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * |dd|`\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    Combining the terms, we get: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    The quantity we want is `dN/d(plx)`. Rearranging the equation gives:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the final proportionality is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Correct Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the quantity requested: the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`). This is different from other related quantities.

Since `d = 1/plx`, this contributes a `1/plx²` factor. This means more distant shells are vastly larger.\n    *   **Interval Mapping Factor / Jacobian (`1/plx²`)**: The conversion from a distance interval `dd` to a parallax interval `d(plx)` is non-linear. A fixed parallax interval corresponds to a much larger distance interval for more distant stars (which have smaller parallaxes). This change of variables for the differential element, `|dd/d(plx)|`, contributes the second `1/plx²` factor.\n\n3.  **Consensus on Derivation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the mathematical derivation, arriving at the `1/plx⁴` relationship.

This quantity is the differential `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars. The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space, meaning the number of stars per unit volume, the stellar density `ρ`, is a constant.\n\n2.  **Count Stars in a Distance Shell**: The standard approach is to count the number of stars (`dN`) within a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer.\n    *   Let the shell's radius be `d` and its thickness be `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: The question requires the answer in terms of parallax, not distance. The fundamental relationship is that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables**: This is the most critical step of the derivation. The expression for `dN` must be converted from distance coordinates (`d`, `dd`) to parallax coordinates (`plx`, `d(plx)`). This requires two substitutions.\n    *   **Substitution for `d²`**: The `d²` term, which comes from the surface area of the shell, becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution for `dd`**: The distance interval `dd` must be related to the parallax interval `d(plx)`. This is done by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars in a positive interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Find the Final Proportionality**: Now, we substitute both parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    *   Combining the terms gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. Rearranging the equation gives:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the final relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Correct Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the quantity requested: the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`). A common mistake is to solve for a different quantity, such as the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dd ∝ d² ∝ 1/plx²`) or the cumulative number of stars within a certain distance (`N ∝ d³ ∝ 1/plx³`).\n*   **The Two Factors of `1/plx²`**: The final `1/plx⁴` dependency arises from two distinct and equally important sources. Forgetting either one is the most common conceptual error in this derivation.\n    1.  **Geometric Factor**: The surface area of the spherical shell grows as `d²`, which contributes a `1/plx²` factor. This is because more distant shells contain vastly more volume.\n    2.  **Interval Mapping Factor (Jacobian)**: The conversion from a distance interval `dd` to a parallax interval `d(plx)` is non-linear. A fixed parallax interval (e.g., 0.01 arcsec) corresponds to a much larger distance interval for more distant stars (which have smaller parallaxes).

The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space, meaning the number of stars per unit volume, the stellar density `ρ`, is a constant.\n\n2.  **Count Stars in a Distance Shell**: The most direct method is to count the number of stars (`dN`) within a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer.\n    *   Let the shell have a radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: The question requires the answer in terms of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). The standard astronomical definition relates parallax to distance inversely:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables**: This is the most critical step. We must convert the expression for `dN` from being in terms of distance (`d`, `dd`) into an expression in terms of parallax (`plx`, `d(plx)`). This requires two substitutions.\n    *   **Substitution 1 (for `d²`)**: The `d²` term, which comes from the surface area of the shell, becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution 2 (for `dd`)**: We must relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to a corresponding range in parallax `d(plx)`. This is done by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars in a positive interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Find the Final Proportionality**: Now, we substitute both parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    *   Combining the terms gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. By rearranging the equation, we get:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the final relationship is: **`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Correct Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the quantity requested: the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`). Common mistakes involve solving for related but incorrect quantities, such as the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dd ∝ d² ∝ 1/plx²`) or the cumulative number of stars within a certain distance (`N ∝ d³ ∝ 1/plx³`). These incorrect quantities match the other options (A, C, D), highlighting the importance of precision.\n*   **The Two Factors of `1/plx²`**: The final `1/plx⁴` dependency arises from two distinct and equally important sources. Forgetting either one is the most common conceptual error in this derivation.\n    1.  **Geometric Factor**: The surface area of the spherical shell grows as `d²`, which contributes a `1/plx²` factor. This means more distant shells are vastly larger.\n    2.  **Interval Mapping Factor (Jacobian)**: The conversion from a distance interval `dd` to a parallax interval `d(plx)` is non-linear. A fixed parallax interval corresponds to a much larger distance interval for more distant stars (smaller parallax). This contributes the second `1/plx²` factor.\n*   **Consensus on Derivation**: The fact that all 15 candidate answers correctly performed this derivation provides extremely high confidence in the `~ 1/plx⁴` result. The variation in their final letter choices is an artifact of the experimental setup and should be disregarded in favor of the robustly derived physical law.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis robustly shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.

This means the number of stars per unit volume, the stellar number density (`ρ`), is a constant.\n\n2.  **Counting Stars in a Volume Shell**: We consider the number of stars (`dN`) in a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer. Let this shell have a radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell is `dV = (surface area) × (thickness) = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introducing the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: Parallax is, by definition, inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Performing a Change of Variables**: This is the most critical step. To answer the question, the expression for `dN` must be converted from being in terms of distance (`d`, `dd`) to being in terms of parallax (`plx`, `d(plx)`). This requires two substitutions:\n    *   **Substitution for `d²`**: The `d²` term, which comes from the surface area of the shell, becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution for `dd`**: The thickness of the shell `dd` must be related to a corresponding range in parallax `d(plx)`. This is found by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Combining and Simplifying**: Now, we substitute both parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    *   Combining the terms gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Deriving the Final Proportionality**: The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. By rearranging the equation from the previous step, we get:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the final relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Correct Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the quantity requested: the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`). A common mistake is to solve for a different quantity, such as the total number of stars within a certain distance (`N ∝ d³ ∝ 1/plx³`) or the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dd ∝ d² ∝ 1/plx²`).\n\n2.  **The Two Factors of `1/plx²`**: The final `1/plx⁴` dependency arises from two distinct physical and mathematical effects. Forgetting either one is a classic error that would lead to an incorrect `1/plx²` answer.\n    *   **Geometric Factor**: The surface area of the shell grows as `d²`, contributing a `1/plx²` factor. This is because more distant shells are vastly larger.\n    *   **Interval Mapping Factor (Jacobian)**: The change of variables for the differential element `dd` to `d(plx)` contributes another `1/plx²` factor. This accounts for the non-linear relationship between distance and parallax intervals; a fixed parallax interval corresponds to a much larger distance interval for more distant stars (which have smaller parallaxes).\n\n3.  **Consensus on Derivation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform this derivation and arrive at the `1/plx⁴` relationship.

Therefore, the correct approach is to follow the unanimous derivation and match the result to the options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Goal and Core Assumption**: The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with parallax (`plx`). In mathematical terms, this is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars. The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space, meaning the number of stars per unit volume, the stellar density `ρ`, is a constant.\n\n2.  **Count Stars in a Distance Shell**: The most direct method is to count the number of stars (`dN`) within a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer.\n    *   Let the shell have a radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: The question requires the answer in terms of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). The standard astronomical definition relates parallax to distance inversely:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables (The Crucial Step)**: To get the answer in terms of parallax, we must convert the expression for `dN` from distance coordinates (`d`, `dd`) to parallax coordinates (`plx`, `d(plx)`). This requires two substitutions.\n    *   **Substitution 1 (for `d²`)**: The `d²` term, which comes from the surface area of the shell, becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution 2 (for `dd`)**: We must relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to a corresponding range in parallax `d(plx)`. This is done by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars in a positive interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Find the Final Proportionality**: Now, we substitute both parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * |d(plx)| )`\n    *   Combining the terms gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Derive the Final Answer**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. By rearranging the equation from the previous step, we get:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the final relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Correct Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the quantity requested: the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`). The other options represent common mistakes.\n    *   `~ 1/plx³` corresponds to the *cumulative* number of stars out to a certain parallax (`N(plx)`).\n    *   `~ 1/plx²` corresponds to the number of stars *per unit distance* (`dN/dd`). This is a common error where the second parallax factor is forgotten.\n    *   `~ 1/plx¹` does not correspond to a simple physical quantity in this problem.\n\n2.  **The Two Factors of `1/plx²`**: The final `1/plx⁴` dependency is not trivial and arises from two distinct effects. Forgetting the second is the most common conceptual error.\n    *   **Geometric Factor (`1/plx²`)**: The volume of space in a shell at distance `d` grows with the surface area, `4πd²`. This contributes the first `1/plx²` factor.\n    *   **Interval Mapping Factor / Jacobian (`1/plx²`)**: The relationship between a distance interval `dd` and a parallax interval `d(plx)` is non-linear. A fixed parallax interval corresponds to a much larger distance interval for more distant stars (smaller parallaxes). This change of variables for the differential element contributes the second `1/plx²` factor.\n\n3.  **Consensus on Derivation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the mathematical derivation and arrive at the `1/plx⁴` relationship.

The correct approach, therefore, is to follow the consensus derivation and match it to the options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Goal and Core Assumption**: The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with parallax (`plx`). In mathematical terms, this is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars. The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space, meaning the number of stars per unit volume (the stellar density, `ρ`) is a constant.\n\n2.  **Count Stars in a Distance Shell**: The most direct method is to count the number of stars (`dN`) within a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer.\n    *   Let the shell have a radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: The question requires the answer in terms of parallax, not distance. Parallax is defined as being inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables**: This is the most critical step. The expression for `dN` must be converted from distance coordinates (`d`, `dd`) to parallax coordinates (`plx`, `d(plx)`). This requires two substitutions:\n    *   **Substitution for `d²`**: The `d²` term, which comes from the surface area of the shell, becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution for `dd`**: We must relate the distance interval `dd` to the parallax interval `d(plx)`. This is done by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars in a positive interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Find the Final Proportionality**: Now, we substitute both parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    *   Combining the terms gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Derive the Final Answer**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. By rearranging the equation from the previous step, we get:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the final relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Correct Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the quantity requested: the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`). Common mistakes involve solving for related but incorrect quantities, such as the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dd ∝ d² ∝ 1/plx²`) or the cumulative number of stars within a certain distance (`N ∝ d³ ∝ 1/plx³`). These correspond to options C and A, respectively.\n*   **The Two Factors of `1/plx²`**: The final `1/plx⁴` dependency arises from two distinct and equally important sources. Forgetting either one is the most common conceptual error in this derivation.\n    1.  **Geometric Factor**: The surface area of the spherical shell grows as `d²`, which contributes a `1/plx²` factor.

This change of variables for the differential element contributes the second `1/plx²` factor.\n*   **Consensus on Derivation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the mathematical derivation, arriving at the `1/plx⁴` relationship. This shows an extremely strong consensus on the correct physics and calculus.

So, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: The question requires the answer in terms of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). The standard astronomical definition relates parallax to distance inversely:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables**: This is the most critical step in the derivation. We must convert the expression for `dN`, which is in terms of distance (`d`, `dd`), into an expression in terms of parallax (`plx`, `d(plx)`). This requires two separate substitutions.\n    *   **Substitution 1 (for `d²`)**: The `d²` term, which comes from the surface area of the shell, becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution 2 (for `dd`)**: We must relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to a corresponding range in parallax `d(plx)`. This is done by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars in a positive interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Find the Final Proportionality**: Now, we substitute both parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * d² * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * |d(plx)| )`\n    *   Combining the terms gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`.

The core reasoning, however, is identical and robust across all responses.\n\nThe following is a definitive step-by-step derivation based on this consensus reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Goal and Core Assumption**: The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\". In mathematical terms, if `N` is the number of stars and `plx` is the parallax, we need to find the proportionality for the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, the stellar density (`ρ`), is a constant.\n\n2.  **Count Stars in a Distance Shell**: We consider the number of stars (`dN`) within a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer. Let the shell have a radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). The number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the constant density (`ρ`) times the volume: `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: Parallax (`plx`) is defined as being inversely proportional to distance (`d`). The standard formula is `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables (The Crucial Step)**: To get the answer in terms of parallax, we must substitute for both the `d²` term and the `dd` term.\n    *   **Substitution for `d²`**: Since `d = 1/plx`, the `d²` term becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution for `dd`**: We must relate the distance interval `dd` to the parallax interval `d(plx)`. This is done by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`.\n        For counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Find the Final Proportionality**: Now we substitute the parallax expressions from Step 4 into the equation from Step 2:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * |dd|`\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    Combining the terms, we get: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    The quantity we want is `dN/d(plx)`. Rearranging the equation gives:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the final proportionality is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Correct Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the quantity requested: the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`). This is different from other related quantities. For example, the total number of stars out to a distance `d` is `N(d) ∝ d³ ∝ 1/plx³` (Option A), and the number of stars per unit *distance* is `dN/dd ∝ d² ∝ 1/plx²` (Option D).\n\n2.  **The Two Factors of Parallax**: The final `1/plx⁴` dependency arises from two distinct and equally important sources. Forgetting the second factor is the most common conceptual error in this derivation.\n    *   **Geometric Factor (`1/plx²`)**: The surface area of the spherical shell grows as `d²`. Since `d = 1/plx`, this contributes a `1/plx²` factor. This means more distant shells are vastly larger.\n    *   **Interval Mapping Factor / Jacobian (`1/plx²`)**: The conversion from a distance interval `dd` to a parallax interval `d(plx)` is non-linear. A fixed parallax interval corresponds to a much larger distance interval for more distant stars (which have smaller parallaxes). This change of variables for the differential element, `|dd/d(plx)|`, contributes the second `1/plx²` factor.\n\n3.  **Consensus on Derivation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the mathematical derivation, arriving at the `1/plx⁴` relationship. This shows an extremely strong consensus on the correct physics and calculus.

In mathematical terms, if `N` is the number of stars, we need to find the proportionality for the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. The core assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space, meaning the number of stars per unit volume, the stellar density `ρ`, is a constant.\n\n2.  **Count Stars in a Distance Shell**: The most direct method is to count the number of stars (`dN`) within a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer.\n    *   Let the shell have a radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: The question requires the answer in terms of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). The standard astronomical definition relates parallax to distance inversely:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables**: This is the most critical step. We must convert the expression for `dN` from being in terms of distance (`d`, `dd`) into an expression in terms of parallax (`plx`, `d(plx)`). This requires two substitutions.\n    *   **Substitution 1 (for `d²`)**: The `d²` term, which comes from the surface area of the shell, becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution 2 (for `dd`)**: We must relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to a corresponding range in parallax `d(plx)`. This is done by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars in a positive interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Find the Final Proportionality**: Now, we substitute both parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    *   Combining the terms gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. By rearranging the equation, we get:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the final relationship is: **`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Correct Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the quantity requested: the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`). Common mistakes involve solving for related but incorrect quantities, such as the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dd ∝ d² ∝ 1/plx²`) or the cumulative number of stars within a certain distance (`N ∝ d³ ∝ 1/plx³`). These incorrect quantities match the other options (A, C, D), highlighting the importance of precision.\n*   **The Two Factors of `1/plx²`**: The final `1/plx⁴` dependency arises from two distinct and equally important sources. Forgetting either one is the most common conceptual error in this derivation.\n    1.  **Geometric Factor**: The surface area of the spherical shell grows as `d²`, which contributes a `1/plx²` factor.

A fixed parallax interval corresponds to a much larger distance interval for more distant stars (smaller parallax).

The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the agents is a result of the options being presented in a different, randomized order for each agent. Therefore, the core derivation, which is consistent across all answers, is the most reliable path to the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\nThe goal is to determine how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on the parallax (`plx`), assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space.\n\n1.  **Core Assumption**: Stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, the stellar number density (`ρ`), is a constant.\n\n2.  **Counting Stars in a Volume Shell**: We consider the number of stars (`dN`) in a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer. Let this shell have a radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell is `dV = (surface area) × (thickness) = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introducing the Parallax-Distance Relationship**: Parallax is, by definition, inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Performing a Change of Variables**: This is the most critical step. To answer the question, the expression for `dN` must be converted from being in terms of distance (`d`, `dd`) to being in terms of parallax (`plx`, `d(plx)`). This requires two substitutions:\n    *   **Substitution for `d²`**: The `d²` term, which comes from the surface area of the shell, becomes `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   **Substitution for `dd`**: The thickness of the shell `dd` must be related to a corresponding range in parallax `d(plx)`. This is found by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Combining and Simplifying**: Now, we substitute both parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (d²) * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    *   Combining the terms gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Deriving the Final Proportionality**: The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. By rearranging the equation from the previous step, we get:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the final relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Correct Quantity**: It is crucial to solve for the quantity requested: the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`). A common mistake is to solve for a different quantity, such as the total number of stars within a certain distance (`N ∝ d³ ∝ 1/plx³`) or the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dd ∝ d² ∝ 1/plx²`).\n\n2.  **The Two Factors of `1/plx²`**: The final `1/plx⁴` dependency arises from two distinct physical and mathematical effects. Forgetting either one is a classic error that would lead to an incorrect `1/plx²` answer.\n    *   **Geometric Factor**: The surface area of the shell grows as `d²`, contributing a `1/plx²` factor. This is because more distant shells are vastly larger.\n    *   **Interval Mapping Factor (Jacobian)**: The change of variables for the differential element `dd` to `d(plx)` contributes another `1/plx²` factor. This accounts for the non-linear relationship between distance and parallax intervals; a fixed parallax interval corresponds to a much larger distance interval for more distant stars (which have smaller parallaxes).\n\n3.  **Consensus on Derivation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform this derivation and arrive at the `1/plx⁴` relationship.
