  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers and correcting any inconsistencies.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the spectral information for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   Each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons. In a 1:1 molar mixture, a 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most logical conclusion is that the mixture contains two compounds that each produce one 2H singlet, and these singlets appear at slightly different chemical shifts.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical clue. It means the protons giving rise to these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with. This immediately rules out any compound with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as they would produce a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated** as a possibility.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Calculating Absolute Integration.** Each C₁₀H₁₄ tetramethylbenzene isomer has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion from Data:** We are looking for a pair of compounds that, when combined, produce two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Isomer**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 1.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Correct Symmetry Analysis.** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons. This plane makes the aromatic protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. Several candidate answers incorrectly state this compound gives two 1H singlets; this is a common error.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (**one 6H singlet**), the unique one at C2 (**one 3H singlet**), and the unique one at C5 (**one 3H singlet**).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Mixture Option from the Question**\n\nWe will now test each option (A, B, C, D) against the requirements derived from the data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from Durene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This gives a total of **four** aliphatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture correctly produces **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio. **This is a match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is eliminated because it contains 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This would result in at least four signals (five if the 6H signals don't overlap). This does not match the data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B in the question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a systematic, step-by-step analysis is required. We will first interpret the spectral data, then predict the spectrum for each individual candidate molecule, and finally evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical piece of information. It means the protons giving rise to these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with. This immediately rules out any compound with alkyl groups that would show spin-spin splitting, such as **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which has ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) that would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration Calculation.** Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer in question is a tetramethylbenzene, having 4 methyl groups and thus 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion for Aliphatic Region:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Number and Ratio of Signals.** The mixture produces only two types of aromatic protons. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. As each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons, the most direct interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one 2H singlet.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each isomer is determined by its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Step 1, this compound is **eliminated**. This immediately invalidates **Option B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (**one 6H singlet**), the unique one at C2 (**one 3H singlet**), and the unique one at C5 (**one 3H singlet**).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the pair of compounds whose combined spectra match the experimental data: two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H singlet, two 3H singlets).\n    *   Combined Result: [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is at least four signals. **Does not match.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **FAILED.** Contains the eliminated 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) = **Two 2H singlets**. This gives the required two signals in a 1:1 ratio. **(MATCH)**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) = **Three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This gives the required 2:1:1 ratio. **(MATCH)**\n    *   This pair perfectly matches all experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (one 6H singlet, two 3H singlets).\n    *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is four signals. **Does not match.**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1.

Does not match the \"three aliphatic signals\" data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the spectral information for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Mixture Ratio:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds, both with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. This means the total proton count from each compound contributes equally to the spectrum's integration.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical piece of information. It means the protons giving rise to these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with. This immediately rules out any compound with alkyl groups that would show spin-spin splitting, such as the ethyl groups in **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration Calculation.** Each C₁₀H₁₄ tetramethylbenzene isomer has four methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion for Aliphatic Region:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Number and Integration of Signals.** The mixture shows a total of two distinct aromatic signals. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. As each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons, the most direct interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one 2H singlet.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry, which dictates the chemical equivalence of its protons.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Step 1, the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet. This compound is **eliminated**. This rules out **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (one 6H singlet), the unique methyl on the symmetry axis at C2 (one 3H singlet), and the unique methyl on the symmetry axis at C5 (one 3H singlet). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data: two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** Eliminated in Step 2.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Prehnitene: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in at least four signals (e.g., [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H], assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Durene: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in four signals [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will therefore show **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a rigorous, step-by-step analysis is required. This involves carefully interpreting the provided ¹H NMR data, correctly predicting the spectrum for each candidate molecule based on its symmetry, and then evaluating which mixture matches the data.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **\"All Singlets\" is a Critical Filter:** The problem explicitly states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. This immediately rules out any compound with coupled protons, like the ethyl groups in 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n2.  **Correct Proton Integration:** The mixture is 1:1. Each tetramethylbenzene isomer (C₁₀H₁₄) has 12 aliphatic protons. Therefore, the total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 + 12 = 24. The given 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) must be applied to this total, yielding signals corresponding to (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, and (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n3.  **Symmetry Dictates the Spectrum:** The number of unique signals a molecule produces is determined by its chemical symmetry. Protons that are interchangeable through a symmetry operation (like a plane of symmetry) are chemically equivalent and appear as a single signal.\n4.  **Aromatic Signal Interpretation:** The presence of two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio for a 1:1 mixture strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (2H each).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data and Eliminate Candidates**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The spectrum has three singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The \"all singlets\" requirement immediately **eliminates 1,4-diethylbenzene**. Its ethyl groups would show splitting (a quartet and a triplet). This rules out **Option D**.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This means the mixture contains two types of aromatic protons, and there are equal numbers of each type. This is consistent with a mixture of two different tetramethylbenzene isomers that each produce a single 2H aromatic signal.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Spectrum for Each Tetramethylbenzene Isomer**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of the three remaining isomers to predict their individual ¹H NMR signals.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This produces **one 12H singlet**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry passing between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (**one 6H singlet**), the unique methyl at C2 (**one 3H singlet**), and the unique methyl at C5 (**one 3H singlet**).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe now combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the remaining options (A, B, C) to see which one matches the required aliphatic signals of [12H, 6H, 6H].\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, and another 3H singlet.\n    *   Combined Result: [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is at least four signals and does not contain a 12H signal. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene) contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** [12H, 6H, 6H]. This gives exactly three singlets with the required integrations to produce a 2:1:1 ratio. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB (Isodurene) contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, and another 3H singlet.\n    *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is four signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the spectral information provided for the 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** In a 1:1 molar mixture, a 1:1 integration ratio for two signals implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most logical interpretation is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (in this case, 2H each).\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that all signals are **singlets** is a critical clue. It immediately rules out any compound with alkyl groups that would exhibit spin-spin splitting (coupling), such as the ethyl groups in 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture must be calculated. Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has four methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry, which dictates the number of chemically unique proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Careful Point 2, the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet. This compound is **eliminated**.

They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** The symmetry of this molecule is often misinterpreted. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons and their attached methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This plane of symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (**one 6H singlet**), the unique methyl group at C2 (**one 3H singlet**), and the unique methyl group at C5 (**one 3H singlet**).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data: two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** Ruled out in Step 2.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Prehnitene: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in at least four signals (e.g., [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H], assuming one 6H signal from each overlaps).

Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. As each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons, the most direct interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one 2H singlet.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Step 1, the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet. This compound is **eliminated**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2, C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (one 6H singlet), the unique methyl at C2 (one 3H singlet), and the unique methyl at C5 (one 3H singlet).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe will now test each option against the required spectral data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also contributes one 2H singlet. The mixture correctly produces **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio. **This is a match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = **Four** total aliphatic signals. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is **eliminated** because it contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, which does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = At least **four** total aliphatic signals (five if the 6H signals don't overlap). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the spectral information for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula & Mixture Ratio:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds, both with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules fit this formula. The 1:1 ratio is essential for interpreting the signal integrations correctly.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical clue. It means the protons giving rise to these signals have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This immediately rules out any compound with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as they would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This invalidates any option containing it, such as **Option C**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration Calculation.** Each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion for Aliphatic Region:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Number of Aromatic Signals.** The entire mixture produces only two distinct types of aromatic protons.\n    *   **Conclusion for Aromatic Region:** Since the mixture is 1:1, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons for each signal is the same. The most direct interpretation is that each of the two compounds contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet corresponds to 2H.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each isomer is determined by its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 1.\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and a hydrogen-bearing carbon) are in different chemical environments. They produce **two distinct 1H singlets**.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Eliminating Isodurene.** A mixture containing Isodurene would show at least three aromatic signals (its own two 1H singlets plus the 2H singlet from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only two aromatic signals. Therefore, **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is eliminated**. This invalidates any option containing it, such as **Options B and D**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Option**\n\nBy eliminating options B, C, and D, we are left with only **Option A**. We must verify that this pair perfectly matches all the data.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum Check:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   **Result:** The 1:1 mixture shows **two singlets**. Since both represent 2H, the integration ratio is 1:1. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum Check:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   **Result:** The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1.

As each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons, the most logical conclusion is that the spectrum shows two distinct 2H singlets, with each compound in the mixture contributing one of them.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Singlets Only.** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. It rules out any compound with alkyl groups that would show spin-spin splitting, such as the ethyl groups in **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which would produce a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration Calculation.** Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has 12 aliphatic protons (from four methyl groups). In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the combination of the two compounds must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry, which dictates the chemical equivalence of its protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 1. This rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at positions 4 and 6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (one 6H singlet), the unique methyl at C2 (one 3H singlet), and the unique methyl at C5 (one 3H singlet). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from Durene) plus three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This gives a total of **four** aliphatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene) plus three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This would result in at least four signals (even if one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture correctly produces **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio. This is a match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was already eliminated in Step 1.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the spectral information for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula & Mixture Ratio:** The mixture is 1:1 molar, and both compounds have the formula C₁₀H₁₄.

This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a rigorous, step-by-step analysis is required. This involves carefully interpreting the provided NMR data, correctly predicting the spectra for each candidate molecule based on its symmetry, and systematically evaluating which mixture matches the experimental evidence.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must translate the spectral information into a set of concrete requirements for our 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1: \"All Singlets\" is a Key Filter.** The fact that all signals are singlets is a powerful clue. It means the protons giving rise to these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with. This immediately rules out any compound with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as they would produce a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Convert Ratios to Absolute Proton Counts.** Each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 12 aliphatic protons (4 x CH₃). In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Requirement:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Requirement:** In a 1:1 mixture, this means there are two distinct aromatic proton environments, and each contains the same number of protons. The most direct interpretation is that each of the two compounds contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents 2H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symmetry Dictates the Spectrum.** Protons that are chemically equivalent due to a molecule's symmetry will appear as a single signal in the NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 1.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2, C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Correctly Analyze Isodurene's Symmetry.** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons. This plane makes the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (**one 6H singlet**), the unique one at C2 (**one 3H singlet**), and the unique one at C5 (**one 3H singlet**).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the pair whose combined spectra match our requirements. The deciding factor will be the aliphatic signals, as all three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H aromatic singlet, meaning any pair will satisfy the aromatic data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from Durene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene).\n    *   **Result:** Four aliphatic signals [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Result:** Eliminated in Step 1. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** One 12H singlet (from Durene) + two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene).\n    *   **Result:** A total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This corresponds to the required 2:1:1 ratio. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene).\n    *   **Result:** At least four aliphatic signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a rigorous, step-by-step analysis is required. This involves carefully interpreting the provided ¹H NMR data, correctly predicting the spectra for each candidate molecule based on its symmetry, and then evaluating which mixture matches the data.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem describes a 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers with the following spectral features:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point:** In a 1:1 mixture, a 1:1 integration ratio means the number of protons contributing to each signal is equal. Since each tetramethylbenzene isomer has two aromatic protons, the most logical interpretation is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one distinct 2H singlet. This results in two signals with a 2H:2H (i.e., 1:1) ratio.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Signal Type):** The fact that all signals are **singlets** is a critical clue. It means the protons giving rise to these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with. This immediately rules out any compound with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as they would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Integration Calculation):** Each C₁₀H₁₄ tetramethylbenzene isomer has four methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n\n*   **Summary of Requirements:** We are looking for a pair of compounds that, when combined in a 1:1 ratio, produce two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe prediction is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Step 1, the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated**. This rules out option **B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (one 6H singlet), the unique methyl at C2 (one 3H singlet), and the unique methyl at C5 (one 3H singlet).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the spectral information for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Mixture Ratio:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds, both with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. This is crucial for calculating the integration of the signals.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical piece of information.

Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration Calculation.** The remaining candidates are tetramethylbenzenes, each having four methyl groups and thus 12 aliphatic protons.

In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion for Aliphatic Region:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Number and Ratio of Signals.** The mixture produces only two types of aromatic protons.

This is four signals. **Does not match.**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the spectral information for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Singlets.** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. It means the protons giving rise to these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with. This immediately rules out any compound with alkyl groups that would show spin-spin splitting, such as **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which has ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) that would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration Calculation.** Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer in question is a tetramethylbenzene, having 4 methyl groups and thus 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Number and Ratio of Signals.** The mixture produces only two types of aromatic protons. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. As each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons, the most direct interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one 2H singlet.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 1. This rules out **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (one 6H singlet), the unique methyl at C2 (one 3H singlet), and the unique methyl at C5 (one 3H singlet). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the pair of compounds whose combined spectra match the experimental data: two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** Already eliminated.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from Durene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This gives a total of **four** aliphatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This would result in at least four signals (even if one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture correctly produces **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio. This is a match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.

This immediately rules out any compound with coupled protons, like the ethyl groups in 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n2.  **Correct Proton Integration:** The mixture is 1:1. Each tetramethylbenzene isomer (C₁₀H₁₄) has 12 aliphatic protons. Therefore, the total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 + 12 = 24. The given 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) must be applied to this total, yielding signals corresponding to (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, and (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n3.  **Symmetry Dictates the Spectrum:** The number of unique signals a molecule produces is determined by its chemical symmetry. Protons that are interchangeable through a symmetry operation (like a plane of symmetry) are chemically equivalent and appear as a single signal.\n4.  **Aromatic Signal Interpretation:** The presence of two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio for a 1:1 mixture strongly implies that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (2H each).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data and Eliminate Candidates**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The spectrum has three singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The \"all singlets\" requirement immediately **eliminates 1,4-diethylbenzene**. Its ethyl groups would show splitting (a quartet and a triplet). This rules out **Option D**.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This means the mixture contains two types of aromatic protons, and there are equal numbers of each type. This is consistent with a mixture of two different tetramethylbenzene isomers that each produce a single 2H aromatic signal.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Spectrum for Each Tetramethylbenzene Isomer**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of the three remaining isomers to predict their individual ¹H NMR signals.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This produces **one 12H singlet**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry passing between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. This produces **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (**one 6H singlet**), the unique methyl at C2 (**one 3H singlet**), and the unique methyl at C5 (**one 3H singlet**).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe now combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the remaining options (A, B, C) to see which one matches the required aliphatic signals of [12H, 6H, 6H].\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, and another 3H singlet.\n    *   Combined Result: [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is at least four signals and does not contain a 12H signal. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene) contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** [12H, 6H, 6H]. This gives exactly three singlets with the required integrations to produce a 2:1:1 ratio. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB (Isodurene) contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, and another 3H singlet.\n    *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is four signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the spectral information provided for the 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** In a 1:1 molar mixture, a 1:1 integration ratio for two signals implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most logical interpretation is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (in this case, 2H each).\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that all signals are **singlets** is a critical clue. It immediately rules out any compound with alkyl groups that would exhibit spin-spin splitting (coupling), such as the ethyl groups in 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture must be calculated. Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has four methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry, which dictates the number of chemically unique proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Careful Point 2, the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet. This compound is **eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option C**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** The symmetry of this molecule is often misinterpreted. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons and their attached methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This plane of symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (**one 6H singlet**), the unique methyl group at C2 (**one 3H singlet**), and the unique methyl group at C5 (**one 3H singlet**).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data: two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** Ruled out in Step 2.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Prehnitene: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in at least four signals (e.g., [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H], assuming one 6H signal from each overlaps). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Durene: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in four signals [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will therefore show **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the spectral information for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Mixture Ratio:** The sample is a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Signals are Singlets.** This is a critical piece of information. It means the protons giving rise to these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with. This immediately rules out any compound with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as they would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated** as a possibility.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration Calculation.** Each of the tetramethylbenzene isomers has four methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion for Aliphatic Region:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Number and Ratio of Signals.** The mixture shows only two types of aromatic protons. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The most direct interpretation is that each of the two compounds in the mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents 2H.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound\n\nThe prediction is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Step 1, this compound is **eliminated**.

They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (a 6H singlet), the unique one at C2 (a 3H singlet), and the unique one at C5 (a 3H singlet).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nWe must find the pair of compounds whose combined spectra match the experimental data: two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The aromatic data is satisfied by any pair of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers, so the aliphatic data is the deciding factor.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Two 6H singlets (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) + one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB).\n    *   Combined Result: [6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is at least four signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Incorrect.** Eliminated in Step 2.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB).\n    *   Combined Result: [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This is four signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** One **12H singlet** (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + **two 6H singlets** (from 1,2,3,4-TMB).\n    *   **Combined Result:** [12H, 6H, 6H]. This gives exactly **three singlets** with the required integrations for a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One 2H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + one 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-TMB). This gives two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1.

Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration Calculation.** The mixture is 1:1. The isomers are C₁₀H₁₄, which means they are tetramethylbenzenes, each having 4 methyl groups (12 aliphatic protons). The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1).

This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and a hydrogen-bearing carbon) are in different chemical environments. They produce **two distinct 1H singlets**.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Eliminating Isodurene.** A mixture containing Isodurene would show at least three aromatic signals (its own two 1H singlets plus the 2H singlet from the other compound). This contradicts the experimental data of only two aromatic signals. Therefore, **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is eliminated**. This invalidates any option containing it, such as **Options B and D**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Option**\n\nBy eliminating options B, C, and D, we are left with only **Option A**. We must verify that this pair perfectly matches all the data.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum Check:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   **Result:** The 1:1 mixture shows **two singlets**. Since both represent 2H, the integration ratio is 1:1. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum Check:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n        *   **Result:** The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the spectral information for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. As each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons, the most logical conclusion is that the spectrum shows two distinct 2H singlets, with each compound in the mixture contributing one of them.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Singlets Only.** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. It rules out any compound with alkyl groups that would show spin-spin splitting, such as the ethyl groups in **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which would produce a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration Calculation.** Each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has 12 aliphatic protons (from four methyl groups). In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Therefore, the combination of the two compounds must produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry, which dictates the chemical equivalence of its protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 1. This rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at positions 4 and 6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (one 6H singlet), the unique methyl at C2 (one 3H singlet), and the unique methyl at C5 (one 3H singlet). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that produces two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from Durene) plus three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This gives a total of **four** aliphatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: Two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene) plus three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene). This would result in at least four signals (even if one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene also contributes one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture correctly produces **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio. This is a match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene contributes **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was already eliminated in Step 1.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the spectral information for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula & Mixture Ratio:** The mixture is 1:1 molar, and both compounds have the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"three signals (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1: All Singlets.** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. It means the protons giving rise to these signals have no non-equivalent adjacent protons to couple with. This immediately rules out any compound with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as they would produce a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Integration.** Each C₁₀H₁₄ tetramethylbenzene isomer has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   **Conclusion:** The correct pair of compounds must combine to produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Number and Integration.** The mixture shows only two types of aromatic protons. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. As each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 2 aromatic protons, the most direct interpretation is that each compound in the mixture contributes one 2H singlet.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is determined by its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 1.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (**one 6H singlet**), the unique methyl group at C2 (**one 3H singlet**), and the unique methyl group at C5 (**one 3H singlet**).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the pair of compounds whose combined spectra match the experimental data: two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** FAILED. Contains the eliminated 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) = **Two 2H singlets**. This gives the required two signals in a 1:1 ratio. **(MATCH)**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) = **Three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This gives the required 2:1:1 ratio. **(MATCH)**\n    *   This pair perfectly matches all experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = **Four** total aliphatic signals. FAILED. Does not match the \"three aliphatic signals\" data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H) = At least **four** total aliphatic signals (five if the 6H signals don't overlap). FAILED. Does not match the \"three aliphatic signals\" data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a systematic, step-by-step analysis is required, synthesizing the correct points from the candidate answers and correcting any errors.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the spectral information provided for the 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows \"two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, the 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second.

In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio has 4 total parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the absolute number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) × 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) × 24H = **6H**\n\n*   **Summary of Requirements:** We are looking for a pair of compounds that, when combined in a 1:1 ratio, produce two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe prediction is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Step 1, the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated**. This rules out option **B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two 6H singlets**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 chemically equivalent. They produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (one 6H singlet), the unique methyl at C2 (one 3H singlet), and the unique methyl at C5 (one 3H singlet). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe must find the 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data. The deciding factor will be the aliphatic signals, as any pair of the tetramethylbenzene isomers will produce the correct aromatic signals.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Durene: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined Result: **Four** aliphatic signals [12H, 6H, 3H, 3H]. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Ruled out in Step 2.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic signals from Durene:** **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals from Prehnitene:** **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Prehnitene: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from Isodurene: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined Result: At least four aliphatic signals (five if the 6H signals do not overlap). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
