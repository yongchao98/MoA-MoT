The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are due to the agents being presented with shuffled versions of the multiple-choice options and do not reflect any disagreement on the solution itself.\n\nThe following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, the star's properties ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) are constant. The problem also states the planets have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, leaving a simplified relationship that depends only on the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Simplify Using Problem Constraints:** A critical piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, which justifies the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets. Therefore, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, and the term can be removed. The simplified formula is:\n    $$ K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n\n5.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** By rearranging the formula to solve for $a$, we get $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. We can now find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n6.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Expression:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2. The square root cancels the squared terms:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n7.  **Substitute Doppler Shift Data:** The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) it causes. Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). This gives the final formula for calculation:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n8.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** Plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the options provided in the original question:\n    A) ~ 1.30\n    B) ~ 0.98\n    C) ~ 1.05\n    D) ~ 0.53\n\n    The calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii and the specific spectral line wavelength. This information is not needed to calculate the final *ratio* and can be considered distractors to test conceptual understanding.\n*   **Significance of the Transit Method:** The statement that the planets were detected using *both* transit and RV methods is crucial. The transit detection justifies the key assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets, which means $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. This simplifies the RV formula and makes the problem solvable.\n*   **Index Consistency:** It is critical to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent throughout the derivation. An easy mistake is to invert one of the ratios. The final formula correctly shows the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) is proportional to the inverse mass ratio ($M_2/M_1$) and the direct Doppler shift ratio ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n*   **Doppler Shift vs. RV Amplitude:** It is essential to recognize that the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). This allows the direct use of the ratio of the given Doppler shifts in place of the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the mathematical derivation, and the final numerical result.

When forming a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, the star's properties ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) are constant. The problem also states the planets have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to a function of only the semi-major axes ($a$):\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star.

We can now find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Equation:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2.

Finally, I will match the calculated result to the options provided in the original question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Goal Definition**: The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and sharing the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the formula simplifies significantly. This is a point of universal agreement among all candidate answers.\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$). For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Simplification and Final Formula Derivation**: A critical piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, justifying the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The simplified RV formula is $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n    Substituting this back into the temperature ratio equation, the square root cancels the squares:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n    Since the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, their ratios are equal: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$. This gives the final formula for calculation:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not required to solve for the temperature ratio. They are included as contextual details that cancel out in the ratio.\n*   **Significance of Transit Method**: The problem states that the planets were detected using both transit and RV methods. The mention of the transit method is essential because it justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, which allows for the simplification $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n*   **Index Consistency**: It is crucial to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent throughout the derivation. The final formula correctly shows the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) is proportional to the inverse mass ratio ($M_2/M_1$) and the direct Doppler shift ratio ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n*   **Consensus on Calculation**: All candidate answers correctly derive the physical relationship and perform the calculation to arrive at the numerical result of ~0.5357.

For two planets orbiting the same star, the star's effective temperature ($T_{eff}$) and radius ($R_*$) are constant. The problem also states they have the same albedo ($A$). When we form the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, these constant terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star.

The following is a definitive, synthesized analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. For two planets orbiting the same star, the star's effective temperature ($T_{eff}$) and radius ($R_*$) are constant. The problem also states they have the same albedo ($A$). When we form the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, these constant terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**: The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $$ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Simplify and Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, which justifies the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets. Therefore, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, and the term can be removed. The simplified formula is:\n    $$ K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n    Rearranging this to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. Now, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Ratios for the Final Formula**: Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2.

When we form the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, these constant terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Simplify Using Problem Constraints:** A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, which justifies the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets. Therefore, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, and the term can be removed from the equation. The simplified formula is:\n    $$ K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n\n5.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Rearranging the simplified formula to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. We can now find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n6.  **Combine Ratios for the Final Formula:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2. The square root cancels the squared terms:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n7.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). We can now plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii and the specific wavelength of the spectral line.

Finally, I will match the calculated result to the options provided in the original question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Goal Definition**: The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and sharing the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the formula simplifies significantly. This is a point of universal agreement among all candidate answers.\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$). For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Simplification and Final Formula Derivation**: A critical piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, justifying the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The simplified RV formula is $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n    Substituting this back into the temperature ratio equation, the square root cancels the squares:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n    Since the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, their ratios are equal: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.

The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, the star's properties ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) are constant. The problem also states the planets have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, leaving a simplified relationship that depends only on the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. A critical piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**, which justifies assuming the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n\n4.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** By rearranging the formula to solve for $a$, we get $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. We can now find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Expression:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2. The square root cancels the squared terms:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Substitute Doppler Shift Data and Calculate:** The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) it causes. Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). We can now plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii and the specific spectral line. This information is not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out in the derivation. They are included to test a conceptual understanding of the underlying physics.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method:** The statement that the planets were detected using *both* transit and RV methods is crucial. The transit method only works if the planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on (inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$). This justifies the key assumption that $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which simplifies the RV formula and makes the problem solvable.\n*   **Index Consistency:** Throughout the derivation, it is critical to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent to avoid inverting a ratio by mistake. The final formula correctly combines the inverse mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) with the direct Doppler shift ratio ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n*   **Consensus on Calculation:** All provided candidate answers correctly derive the physical relationship and perform the calculation to arrive at the numerical result of ~0.536.

When forming the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, these constant terms cancel out, leaving a simplified relationship that depends only on the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**: The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Simplify and Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, which justifies the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The RV formula simplifies to $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. Rearranging this to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. We can now find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Equation**: Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2. The square root cancels the squared terms:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Use Doppler Shift Data for Final Calculation**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$. The final formula for calculation is:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides several pieces of information that are not needed to calculate the final ratio. These include the star's mass (1.5 M_Sun), radius (1.2 R_Sun), and temperature (6300 K), as well as the planets' radii (1.7 and 1.3 R_Earth) and the specific spectral line ([OI] at 6300 Å). These values are distractors that cancel out when forming the ratio.\n*   **Significance of the Transit Method**: The statement that the planets were detected using *both* transit and RV methods is the most critical piece of information. The transit detection justifies the key assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets, which allows for the simplification $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Without this, the problem would be unsolvable with the given information.\n*   **Index Consistency**: It is vital to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent throughout the derivation. An easy mistake is to invert one of the ratios. The final formula correctly shows that the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) is proportional to the *inverse* mass ratio ($M_2/M_1$) but the *direct* Doppler shift ratio ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n*   **Doppler Shift vs. RV Amplitude**: It is essential to recognize that the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). This allows the direct use of the ratio of the given Doppler shifts in place of the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and unanimously yields a value of approximately 0.5357.
