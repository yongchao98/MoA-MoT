It has a pre-existing stereocenter at C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the two products formed are diastereomers. The original stereocenter at C5 remains (S), while the new one at C3 can be (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n*   **Careful Point:** This molecule is achiral and symmetric. It has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of a symmetric, achiral starting material that creates two new stereocenters can result in enantiomers and meso compounds.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)). It is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed (the R,R enantiomer, the S,S enantiomer, and the meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties, and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different (different molecular formulas) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The total mixture contains all unique stereoisomers from both reactions.\n    *   Total unique compounds = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all five of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the key points required to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Initial Chirality**: This molecule is chiral and is provided as a single enantiomer, with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, creating a new stereocenter at this position.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the two resulting products are diastereomers. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: **Two** distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Achiral Starting Material**: This molecule is achiral because it is symmetric and possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The reduction of a symmetric, achiral starting material that creates two new stereocenters results in the formation of all possible stereoisomers. These are:\n    1.  A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: **Three** distinct stereoisomers are formed (the two enantiomers and the meso compound).\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains a total of 2 products from Reaction I and 3 products from Reaction II, making **5 unique stereoisomers** in total.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Principle of Achiral Separation**: A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Calculation**:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers are physically identical in an achiral environment and will elute as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different molecules and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Principle of Chiral Separation**: A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, enabling it to separate enantiomers from each other, as well as from diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Calculation**:\n    *   The column will resolve every unique stereoisomer in the mixture.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC**: Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the mixture, the chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis concludes that the combined products will show **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to logically deduce the number of products from each reaction and then determine how they would be separated by the two different types of HPLC. I will break down the problem as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I**: I will determine the stereochemical outcome of the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This involves creating a new stereocenter in a molecule that is already chiral.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II**: I will determine the stereochemical outcome of the reduction of the symmetric, achiral pentane-2,4-dione. This involves creating two new stereocenters.\n3.  **Calculate Normal-Phase HPLC Peaks**: I will determine the number of peaks for the combined mixture on an achiral column, which separates compounds based on different physical properties (separating diastereomers but not enantiomers).\n4.  **Calculate Chiral HPLC Peaks**: I will determine the number of peaks for the combined mixture on a chiral column, which can separate all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n5.  **Select the Final Answer**: I will match the calculated peak counts to the given options.\n\nThe python code below will walk through this logical process step-by-step to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function logically determines the number of peaks in normal-phase and chiral HPLC\n    for the products of the two specified organic reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Reaction I Products\")\n    # Starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a single enantiomer (chiral).\n    # The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter.\n    # Creating a new stereocenter in an already chiral molecule results in diastereomers.\n    # Products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    products_rxn1 = 2\n    print(f\"Reaction I starts with a chiral molecule and creates a new stereocenter, forming {products_rxn1} diastereomers.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis of Reaction II Products\")\n    # Starting material: Pentane-2,4-dione is achiral and symmetric.\n    # The reduction of both ketones creates two new stereocenters (at C2 and C4).\n    # This results in a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound ((2R,4S)).\n    products_rxn2 = 3 # (R,R enantiomer), (S,S enantiomer), and the meso compound are all distinct.\n    print(f\"Reaction II starts with an achiral molecule and creates two stereocenters, forming {products_rxn2} unique stereoisomers (a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)\")\n    # An achiral column separates compounds with different physical properties.\n    # It separates constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but NOT enantiomers.\n    # From Reaction I: The 2 diastereomers have different properties and will separate.\n    peaks_normal_rxn1 = 2\n    # From Reaction II: The enantiomeric pair has identical properties in an achiral environment and elutes as 1 peak.\n    # The meso compound is a diastereomer of the pair and elutes separately.\n    peaks_normal_rxn2 = 2\n    total_peaks_normal = peaks_normal_rxn1 + peaks_normal_rxn2\n    print(\"A normal-phase column separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\")\n    print(f\" - Products from Reaction I (2 diastereomers) will show as {peaks_normal_rxn1} peaks.\")\n    print(f\" - Products from Reaction II (enantiomeric pair + meso) will show as {peaks_normal_rxn2} peaks.\")\n    print(f\"Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = {total_peaks_normal}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)\")\n    # A chiral column can separate all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    # We simply sum the number of unique compounds from both reactions.\n    total_unique_compounds = products_rxn1 + products_rxn2\n    total_peaks_chiral = total_unique_compounds\n    print(\"A chiral column separates all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\")\n    print(f\"Total unique compounds in the mixture = {products_rxn1} (from Rxn I) + {products_rxn2} (from Rxn II) = {total_unique_compounds}.\")\n    print(f\"Total peaks in chiral HPLC = {total_peaks_chiral}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Final Conclusion\")\n    print(f\"The analysis concludes there will be {total_peaks_chiral} peaks in chiral HPLC and {total_peaks_normal} peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to option D.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice:\")\n    print(\"A) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\")\n    print(\"B) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\")\n    print(\"C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\")\n    print(\"D) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\")\n\n# Execute the analysis to print the reasoning.\nsolve_chemistry_hplc_problem()\n<<<D>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 60\n    <<<D>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the provided answers and verifying each step.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5. The starting material is a single enantiomer.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of 3R, 5S would be 3S, 5R). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetric and has an internal plane of symmetry, making it **achiral**.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product will be formed. We must analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry (its mirror image, (2S, 4R), is the same molecule). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed (the R,R enantiomer, the S,S enantiomer, and the meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times. There is no risk of accidental co-elution.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The total mixture contains 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at the C5 position. The starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of 3R, 5S would be 3S, 5R).

The starting material is a single enantiomer.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The reduction of the planar ketone can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations (R and S) at the new C3 stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the two products formed are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.

They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R)).

They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: The reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound). The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Calculation**:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different (different molecular formulas) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Calculation**:\n    *   The total mixture contains all unique stereoisomers from both reactions.\n    *   Total unique compounds = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC**: Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

It has a pre-existing stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol, which creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the two resulting products are not mirror images of each other. The original stereocenter at C5 remains in the (S) configuration, while the new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The two products are **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with pentane-2,4-dione.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This starting material is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Because the starting material is achiral and symmetric, all possible stereoisomers of the product are formed. We must consider the following:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image. It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers (the two individual enantiomers and the one meso compound).\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Mixture on HPLC**\n\nThe total mixture contains 2 products from Reaction I and 3 products from Reaction II, for a total of **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair will elute together as a single peak because they have identical properties in an achiral environment. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different properties and will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different molecules and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The chiral column will resolve all **5 unique stereoisomers** present in the mixture.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This result corresponds to option A.\n\nWhile the chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is correct and unanimous, many of them incorrectly matched their result to the final lettered option. The correct reasoning leads directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and verifying each step.\n\n### **1.

This is a chiral molecule with a single, pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration. The starting material is a single enantiomer.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar ketone at C3 can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S). Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the two products formed are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship**: These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.

This reaction creates two new stereocenters at carbons C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: This reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers (the R,R enantiomer, the S,S enantiomer, and the meso compound).\n\n### **3.

They have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different (different molecular formulas) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **4.

The total number of unique compounds is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC**: Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at the C5 position. The starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of 3R, 5S would be 3S, 5R).

We must analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry (its mirror image, (2S, 4R), is the same molecule).

Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times. There is no risk of accidental co-elution.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The total mixture contains 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak.

This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the two resulting products are diastereomers. The original stereocenter at C5 remains in the (S) configuration, while the new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** This reaction produces **two** distinct diastereomeric products.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting compound, pentane-2,4-dione, is an achiral molecule because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at carbons C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. Its mirror image, (2S, 4R), is the same molecule.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** This reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers (the R,R enantiomer, the S,S enantiomer, and the meso compound).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Calculation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different molecules (different molecular formulas) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Calculation:**\n    *   The total mixture contains all unique stereoisomers from both reactions.\n    *   Total unique compounds = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all five of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak, resulting in **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key points required for an accurate conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It is essential to recognize that this is a **chiral** molecule, provided as a single enantiomer with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, creating a new stereocenter at this position.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The reduction of the planar ketone can occur from two faces, creating two possible configurations at the new C3 stereocenter: (R) and (S). This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Since the two products are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other, they are **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is **achiral** due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, all possible stereoisomers are formed.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same molecule).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral HPLC column separates compounds with different physical properties. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different (different molecular formulas) and will separate from each other.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties, and will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all unique stereoisomers, allowing it to separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The total number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture must be counted.\n    *   From Reaction I: 2 unique diastereomers.\n    *   From Reaction II: 3 unique stereoisomers (the two enantiomers are distinct compounds, plus the meso compound).\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis concludes that the combined product mixture will show **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.

It is already chiral, with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (a strong reducing agent). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and remains in its (S) configuration. The reduction of the planar ketone at C3 can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** These two products are stereoisomers but are not mirror images of each other.

This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, all possible stereoisomers of the product will be formed. We must analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.

This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5. The starting material is a single enantiomer.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of 3R, 5S would be 3S, 5R). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetric and has an internal plane of symmetry, making it **achiral**.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product will be formed. We must analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.

The reduction of the planar ketone at C3 can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products**: The reaction yields two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship**: These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. By definition, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: This reaction produces **two** distinct chemical compounds.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at carbons C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product will be formed. We must analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry (its mirror image, (2S, 4R), is the same molecule). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: This reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers (the R,R enantiomer, the S,S enantiomer, and the meso compound).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Calculation**:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different (different molecular formulas) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Calculation**:\n    *   The total mixture contains all unique stereoisomers from both reactions. The total number of unique compounds is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC**: Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at the C5 position. The starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, creating two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products**: The reaction yields two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship**: These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.

This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product will be formed. We must analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry (its mirror image, (2S, 4R), is the same molecule). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: Three distinct stereoisomers are formed (the R,R enantiomer, the S,S enantiomer, and the meso compound).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis**:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different molecules (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **4.

This result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two different reactions and an understanding of how different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) separate stereoisomers.\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction I: Reduction of a Chiral Ketone**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n*   **Key Point:** This molecule is already chiral. It has a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5. The starting material is a single enantiomer.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the two possible products are not mirror images of each other. They have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at the new C3 center.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion:** These two products are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **2** distinct compounds.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction II: Reduction of an Achiral, Symmetric Dione**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n*   **Key Point:** This molecule is achiral and symmetric, with a plane of symmetry through the central carbon (C3).\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketones (at C2 and C4) are reduced to alcohols, creating two new stereocenters.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** For a symmetric molecule where two new stereocenters are formed, we must check for all possibilities, including meso compounds.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Reaction II produces **3** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture on a Normal-Phase (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The 2 products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The 3 products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (different molecular formulas) and will not have identical retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Combined Mixture on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The total mixture contains all unique stereoisomers from both reactions.\n    *   Total unique compounds = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all five of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting compound, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, is a single enantiomer. It is a chiral molecule with a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the two resulting products are diastereomers. The original stereocenter at C5 remains in the (S) configuration, while the new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** This reaction produces **two** distinct diastereomeric products.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting compound, pentane-2,4-dione, is an achiral molecule because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at carbons C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. Its mirror image, (2S, 4R), is the same molecule.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** This reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers (the R,R enantiomer, the S,S enantiomer, and the meso compound).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Calculation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different molecules (different molecular formulas) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **4.

It is essential to recognize that this is a **chiral** molecule, provided as a single enantiomer with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, creating a new stereocenter at this position.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The reduction of the planar ketone can occur from two faces, creating two possible configurations at the new C3 stereocenter: (R) and (S). This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Since the two products are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other, they are **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is **achiral** due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, all possible stereoisomers are formed.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same molecule).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces **three** distinct stereoisomers: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral HPLC column separates compounds with different physical properties. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different (different molecular formulas) and will separate from each other.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties, and will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all unique stereoisomers, allowing it to separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The total number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture must be counted.\n    *   From Reaction I: 2 unique diastereomers.\n    *   From Reaction II: 3 unique stereoisomers (the two enantiomers are distinct compounds, plus the meso compound).\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis concludes that the combined product mixture will show **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
