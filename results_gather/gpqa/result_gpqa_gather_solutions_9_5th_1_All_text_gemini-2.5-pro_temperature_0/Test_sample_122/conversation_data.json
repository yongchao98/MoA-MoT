Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference.

The discrepancies in the lettered choices among the agents are due to inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options in their individual prompts, not a disagreement on the physics. The following analysis provides a definitive solution based on the options listed in the original question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The ejecta's velocity is `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high speed, the effects of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity are significant and must be applied. The key concept is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`)**: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The time elapsed in the moving frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own reference frame.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation**:\n    *   The distance (`d`) in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`): `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame is longer than the proper time `Δt₀`. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these formulas gives the complete expression for the distance: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the numerator, which represents the classical distance if relativity were ignored:\n        `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Next, calculate the relativistic correction factor in the denominator:\n        `√(1 - (v/c)²) = √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   Finally, calculate the actual distance by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**:\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to **C) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Classical Trap**: A common mistake is to ignore relativity and use the classical formula `distance = velocity × time`. This gives `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option A. This is incorrect because the speed is relativistic.\n2.  **Identifying Proper Time**: The most critical step is recognizing that the 50-second interval is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving object's own reference frame. If the problem had stated that 50 seconds passed in the Galaxy's frame, the answer would have been the classical one (Option A).\n3.  **Logical Sanity Check**: Time *dilation* means that from the Galaxy's perspective, more time passes than the 50 seconds experienced by the ejecta. Therefore, the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options A, B, and D, leaving only C as the plausible answer.\n4.  **Correct Application of the Lorentz Factor**: The Lorentz factor `γ` is always greater than or equal to 1. A calculation error, such as multiplying by `√0.96` instead of dividing, would imply time \"contraction\" (a physically incorrect concept) and lead to a distance less than 3,000,000 km (specifically, ~2,940,000 km, which is option D).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the required formulas, and the final numerical result.

All candidate answers agree on the fundamental physics—that this is a special relativity problem requiring the time dilation formula—but they disagree on the final letter choice due to inconsistent option labeling. I will ignore their letter choices and focus on the options provided in the original question.\n\nMy step-by-step plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Core Principles and Variables**: I will define the velocity (`v`), the proper time (`t_proper`), and the speed of light (`c`). I will state that because the velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%), time dilation must be used.\n2.  **Perform a Logical Sanity Check**: I will first calculate the \"classical\" distance, which ignores relativity. According to the principle of time dilation, the time elapsed in the stationary (Galaxy) frame is longer than the proper time. Therefore, the actual distance traveled must be *greater* than this classical distance. This allows for a quick elimination of incorrect options.\n3.  **Execute the Precise Relativistic Calculation**: I will use the full time dilation formula to calculate the distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. The Python code will perform this calculation.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude**: I will compare the calculated result to the options provided in the original question to determine the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_supernova_distance():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the special relativity problem by calculating the distance traveled,\n    accounting for time dilation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the given values from the problem.\n    # v: The relative velocity of the ejecta in km/s.\n    v = 60000\n    # t_proper: The proper time, which is the time elapsed in the ejecta's\n    # reference frame, in seconds.\n    t_proper = 50\n    # c: The speed of light in km/s.\n    c = 300000\n\n    print(\"--- Step-by-Step Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"This is a special relativity problem requiring the time dilation formula.\")\n    print(f\"Given values: v = {v} km/s, proper time (t₀) = {t_proper} s, c = {c} km/s.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Perform a logical sanity check.\n    print(\"--- Logical Sanity Check ---\")\n    classical_distance = v * t_proper\n    print(f\"1.

The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high velocity, the effects of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity are significant and must be considered. The key principle to apply is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`)**: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The time elapsed in the moving frame is given as 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own frame.

This gives `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option C. This is incorrect because the speed is relativistic.\n2.  **Identifying Proper Time**: The most critical step is correctly identifying that the 50-second interval is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving object's own reference frame. If the problem had stated that 50 seconds passed in the Galaxy's frame, the answer would simply be the classical distance (Option C).\n3.  **The Logical Sanity Check**: The principle of time *dilation* means that a moving clock runs slow as seen by a stationary observer. Therefore, for 50 seconds to pass on the ejecta's clock, *more* than 50 seconds must have passed on the Galaxy's clock.

The discrepancies in the lettered choices among the candidates are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their respective prompts, not a disagreement on the physics.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to solve the problem based on the original question's options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The ejecta's velocity is `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high velocity, the effects of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity are significant and must be considered. The key principle to apply is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`)**: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The time elapsed in the moving frame is given as 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own frame. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation**:\n    *   The distance (`d`) measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`): `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary (Galaxy) frame is longer than the proper time `Δt₀`. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these formulas gives the complete expression for the distance: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the numerator, which represents the classical distance if relativity were ignored:\n        `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Next, calculate the relativistic correction factor in the denominator:\n        `√(1 - (v/c)²) = √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   The value of `√0.96` is approximately `0.9798`.\n    *   Finally, calculate the relativistic distance:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**:\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this to the options provided in the original question:\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Classical Trap**: A common mistake is to ignore relativity and use the classical formula `distance = velocity × time`. This gives `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option C. This is incorrect because the speed is relativistic.\n2.  **Identifying Proper Time**: The most critical step is correctly identifying that the 50-second interval is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving object's own reference frame. If the problem had stated that 50 seconds passed in the Galaxy's frame, the answer would simply be the classical distance (Option C).\n3.  **The Logical Sanity Check**: The principle of time *dilation* means that a moving clock runs slow as seen by a stationary observer. Therefore, for 50 seconds to pass on the ejecta's clock, *more* than 50 seconds must have passed on the Galaxy's clock. Consequently, the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy (`d = v * Δt`) must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options A, B, and C, leaving only D as the plausible answer.\n4.  **Correct Application of the Lorentz Factor**: A potential error is to incorrectly apply the Lorentz factor by multiplying by `√(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing. This would imply time \"contraction\" (a physically incorrect concept) and lead to a distance *shorter* than 3,000,000 km (in this case, `3,000,000 * √0.96 ≈ 2,939,388 km`, which is closest to option B). This is the opposite of time dilation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the mathematical formula, and the final numerical result.
