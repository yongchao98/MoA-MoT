We substitute the given values:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`, which means `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\nNow, we solve for `d_111`:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\nRounding to two decimal places gives **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision and Analysis of Careful Points\nThe calculation consistently yields a value of approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Formula Simplification.** The most reliable answers used the simplified formula for the (111) plane. This approach is less prone to the rounding errors that can occur when substituting decimal approximations into the long, general formula.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Calculation Precision.** There is a strong consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the numerical result. Minor differences (e.g., 9.543 Å vs. 9.526 Å) are attributable to premature rounding of trigonometric values. The exact calculation confirms the value is ~9.54 Å.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Option Matching.** The most significant point of confusion among the candidate answers is the final letter choice. Many answers correctly calculate 9.54 Å but select options A, B, or C. This indicates they were likely working with a shuffled list of options. The crucial final step is to match the calculated value to the specific options provided in the original question.\n\nComparing our calculated result to the provided options:\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 10.05 Angstrom\nC) 9.08 Angstrom\nD) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom directly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.

Compare the calculated result with the given options to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice Parameter `a` (from \"interatomic distance\"): 10 Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial Angle `α`: 30° (for rhombohedral, α = β = γ)\n    *   Miller Indices `(hkl)`: (111)\n\n2.  **Governing Formula:**\n    The formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n3.  **Formula Simplification for the (111) Plane:**\n    For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`. Substituting these values and performing algebraic simplification (as correctly done in several candidate answers like Answer 1 and Answer 11) leads to a much more manageable formula:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    Using this simplified version is the most reliable way to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    We substitute the given values (`a = 10`, `α = 30°`) into the simplified formula.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1 + 2\\cos30^\\circ)} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}))} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n    Solving for `d_111`:\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    Numerically, this evaluates to approximately **9.543 Angstrom**.\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Formula Accuracy:** It is essential to use the correct and complete formula for the rhombohedral system.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** The most common source of minor errors among the candidates was the premature rounding of trigonometric values. The most accurate results are obtained by using the simplified formula, exact fractional values (like `√3/2`), or a high-precision script.\n*   **Option Matching:** This was the most significant point of failure in the candidate answers. A majority of the agents correctly calculated the numerical value to be approximately 9.54 Angstrom. However, many then selected the wrong lettered option (A, B, or C). This is likely because the options were presented to them in a shuffled order.

Using the exact value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`, instead of a rounded decimal approximation, prevents errors. The final numerical evaluation should be the last step.\n\n*   **Option Matching:** A major point of divergence among the candidate answers was the final selection of the lettered option. While nearly all agents correctly calculated the numerical value to be ~9.54 Angstrom, many selected the wrong letter (A, B, or D). This was likely due to being presented with a shuffled list of options. The final decision must be based on matching the calculated value to the original options provided in the question.\n\n### 4.

Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Answers\n*   **Formula Selection:** All agents correctly identified the formula for the rhombohedral system. This is the essential first step.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** The most robust solutions (e.g., Answer 1, 11, 12) simplified the general formula for the (111) plane before calculation. This is a key \"careful point\" as it significantly reduces the complexity and the chance of rounding errors that can occur with the full formula's multiple trigonometric terms.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly calculated the numerical value to be approximately 9.54. Minor deviations in some answers (e.g., 9.526) can be attributed to premature rounding of decimal approximations for `sin(30°)` and `cos(30°)`. Using exact fractions (`1/2` and `√3/2`) or a high-precision calculator/script until the final step yields the more accurate 9.543 value.\n*   **Option Matching:** This was the most significant point of failure among the candidate answers. While the numerical calculation was almost universally correct, many agents selected the wrong lettered option. This indicates that the options were likely presented to them in a shuffled order. The crucial final step is to match the calculated value (9.54 Angstrom) to the options provided in the original question.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nThe calculation consistently and reliably yields a value of approximately 9.54 Angstrom. Comparing this to the original options:\n\nA) 9.08 Angstrom\nB) 8.95 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Problem and Identify Given Information\nThe goal is to calculate the interplanar distance for a specific crystal plane.\n- **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral. This is the most important piece of information as it dictates the formula to be used.\n- **Lattice Parameter `a`:** The problem states an \"interatomic distance\" of 10 Angstrom. For a rhombohedral primitive cell, the lattice vectors have equal length, so we take `a = b = c = 10` Angstrom.\n- **Interaxial Angles `α`:** For a rhombohedral system, `α = β = γ`. The given value is `30°`.\n- **Miller Indices `(hkl)`:** We need to find the distance for the `(111)` plane. So, `h=1`, `k=1`, `l=1`.\n\n### 2. Select the Correct Formula\nThe interplanar spacing `d_hkl` for a rhombohedral (trigonal) crystal system is given by the general formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n### 3. Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane\nWhile we can substitute all values directly, the calculation is complex and prone to rounding errors. A better approach is to first simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane.\n- For `(hkl) = (111)`:\n  - `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n  - `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstitute these into the formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(3)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3\\sin^2\\alpha + 6\\cos^2\\alpha - 6\\cos\\alpha}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\nNow, simplify the numerator and denominator using trigonometric identities and factorization:\n- **Numerator:** Use `sin²α = 1 - cos²α`.\n  `3(1 - cos²α) + 6cos²α - 6cosα = 3 - 3cos²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα = 3cos²α - 6cosα + 3 = 3(cos²α - 2cosα + 1) = 3(1 - cosα)²`\n- **Denominator (volumetric term):** The term `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)` can be factored. Let `x = cosα`. The expression is `2x³ - 3x² + 1`. We can see that `x=1` is a root (`2-3+1=0`), so `(x-1)` is a factor. Polynomial division or synthetic division yields `(x-1)(2x² - x - 1)`, which further factors to `(x-1)(x-1)(2x+1) = (x-1)²(2x+1)`. In terms of `cosα`, this is `(cosα - 1)²(2cosα + 1)` or `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n\nSubstitute the simplified parts back into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\nThe `(1 - cosα)²` terms cancel out, leaving a much simpler formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\nThis simplified formula is specific to the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system and is much easier and more accurate to calculate.\n\n### 4. Perform the Calculation\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values into the simplified formula. To ensure precision, I will use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Description: This script calculates the interplanar distance for the (111) plane\n# of a rhombohedral crystal using the simplified formula derived from the general equation.\n\n# Given parameters\na = 10.0  # Interatomic distance in Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0 # Interaxial angle in degrees\n\n# Convert angle from degrees to radians for use in Python's math functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# The simplified formula for the (111) plane is:\n# 1/d^2 = 3 / (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha)))\n# Therefore, d^2 = (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha))) / 3\n\n# Calculate cos(alpha)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Calculate d^2\nd_squared = (a**2 * (1 + 2 * cos_alpha)) / 3\n\n# Calculate d by taking the square root\nd = math.sqrt(d_squared)\n\n# Print the final result, formatted to a few decimal places for clarity\nprint(f\"{d:.4f}\")\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 9.543 Angstrom.\n\n### 5.

Using a formula for a different system (like cubic or hexagonal) would lead to a completely incorrect answer.\n2.  **Formula Simplification:** For the high-symmetry (111) plane, the general formula simplifies significantly. Using this simplified version is the most reliable method as it drastically reduces the number of terms and minimizes the potential for calculation errors.\n3.  **Calculation Precision:** When performing the calculation, it is best practice to carry exact values (like `√3/2`) through the algebra and perform the numerical approximation as the final step.

There is an overwhelming consensus that the numerical value is ~9.54 Angstrom. However, the final letter choice varied wildly (A, B, C, and D were all chosen).

Compare the calculated result with the given options to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice Parameter `a` (from \"interatomic distance\"): 10 Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial Angle `α`: 30° (for rhombohedral, α = β = γ)\n    *   Miller Indices `(hkl)`: (111)\n\n2.  **Governing Formula:**\n    The formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n3.  **Formula Simplification for the (111) Plane:**\n    For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`. Substituting these values and performing algebraic simplification (as correctly done in several candidate answers like Answer 1 and Answer 11) leads to a much more manageable formula:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    Using this simplified version is the most reliable way to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    We substitute the given values (`a = 10`, `α = 30°`) into the simplified formula.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1 + 2\\cos30^\\circ)} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}))} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n    Solving for `d_111`:\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    Numerically, this evaluates to approximately **9.543 Angstrom**.\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Formula Accuracy:** It is essential to use the correct and complete formula for the rhombohedral system.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** The most common source of minor errors among the candidates was the premature rounding of trigonometric values. The most accurate results are obtained by using the simplified formula, exact fractional values (like `√3/2`), or a high-precision script.\n*   **Option Matching:** This was the most significant point of failure in the candidate answers. A majority of the agents correctly calculated the numerical value to be approximately 9.54 Angstrom. However, many then selected the wrong lettered option (A, B, or C). This is likely because the options were presented to them in a shuffled order. The final decision must be based on matching the calculated value to the original list of options provided in the question.\n\nNow, I will use Python to verify the calculation with high precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.

List of Careful Points\n*   **Formula Simplification:** A critical step to ensure accuracy and simplify the calculation is to substitute the Miller indices (1,1,1) into the formula before plugging in numerical values. As demonstrated by the most robust candidate answers (e.g., Answer 1, Answer 11), the complex general formula simplifies significantly for the (111) plane to:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    Using this simplified version is the most reliable method and minimizes the chance of calculation errors.\n\n*   **Calculation Precision:** It is crucial to maintain precision throughout the calculation. Using the exact value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`, instead of a rounded decimal approximation, prevents errors. The final numerical evaluation should be the last step.\n\n*   **Option Matching:** A major point of divergence among the candidate answers was the final selection of the lettered option. While nearly all agents correctly calculated the numerical value to be ~9.54 Angstrom, many selected the wrong letter (A, B, or D). This was likely due to being presented with a shuffled list of options. The final decision must be based on matching the calculated value to the original options provided in the question.\n\n### 4.

Substitute the given values (`a = 10` Å and `α = 30°`) into the simplified formula.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1+2\\cos30^\\circ)} $$\n\n2.  Use the exact value for `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{100(1+2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}))} = \\frac{3}{100(1+\\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n3.  Solve for `d_111` by inverting the equation and taking the square root.\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1+\\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1+\\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\n4.  Calculate the final numerical value. Using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n### 5.

Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane\nA crucial step for accuracy and simplicity is to substitute the Miller indices `h=1, k=1, l=1` into the formula before performing numerical calculations.

Perform the Calculation\nUsing this simplified formula avoids many potential rounding errors. We substitute the given values:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\nNow, we solve for `d_111`:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\nThe code execution confirms the manual calculation, yielding a value of approximately **9.543 Angstrom**.\n\n### 5.

Agents who rounded trigonometric values (e.g., `cos(30°) ≈ 0.866`) early in the calculation arrived at slightly less accurate results (e.g., 9.526 Å), but the value was still clearly closest to 9.54 Å.

Analyze the Problem Statement\nThe goal is to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\nThe given parameters are:\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter `a`:** 10 Angstrom (The \"interatomic distance\" is interpreted as the length of the primitive lattice vector `a`).\n*   **Interaxial Angles `α`, `β`, `γ`:** All are equal to 30°.\n*   **Miller Indices `(hkl)`:** (111).\n\n### 2. Select the Correct Formula\nFor a rhombohedral crystal system, the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` is given by the following formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nThis formula was correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculation\nTo ensure accuracy and avoid errors, the best method is to first simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane before substituting numerical values.\n\n*   For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n*   Therefore, `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`.\n*   And `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula and simplifying the trigonometric terms (as shown in detail by several candidate answers like Answer 1 and Answer 11) leads to a much simpler expression:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this simplified formula:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`, which means `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\nTo find `d_111`, we invert the equation and take the square root:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nUsing the value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the result is **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\n### 4. Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Answers\n*   **Formula Selection:** All agents correctly identified the formula for the rhombohedral system. This is the essential first step.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** The most robust solutions (e.g., Answer 1, 11, 12) simplified the general formula for the (111) plane before calculation. This is a key \"careful point\" as it significantly reduces the complexity and the chance of rounding errors that can occur with the full formula's multiple trigonometric terms.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly calculated the numerical value to be approximately 9.54. Minor deviations in some answers (e.g., 9.526) can be attributed to premature rounding of decimal approximations for `sin(30°)` and `cos(30°)`. Using exact fractions (`1/2` and `√3/2`) or a high-precision calculator/script until the final step yields the more accurate 9.543 value.\n*   **Option Matching:** This was the most significant point of failure among the candidate answers. While the numerical calculation was almost universally correct, many agents selected the wrong lettered option. This indicates that the options were likely presented to them in a shuffled order. The crucial final step is to match the calculated value (9.54 Angstrom) to the options provided in the original question.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nThe calculation consistently and reliably yields a value of approximately 9.54 Angstrom. Comparing this to the original options:\n\nA) 9.08 Angstrom\nB) 8.95 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Problem and Identify Given Information\nThe goal is to calculate the interplanar distance for a specific crystal plane.\n- **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral. This is the most important piece of information as it dictates the formula to be used.\n- **Lattice Parameter `a`:** The problem states an \"interatomic distance\" of 10 Angstrom. For a rhombohedral primitive cell, the lattice vectors have equal length, so we take `a = b = c = 10` Angstrom.\n- **Interaxial Angles `α`:** For a rhombohedral system, `α = β = γ`. The given value is `30°`.\n- **Miller Indices `(hkl)`:** We need to find the distance for the `(111)` plane. So, `h=1`, `k=1`, `l=1`.\n\n### 2. Select the Correct Formula\nThe interplanar spacing `d_hkl` for a rhombohedral (trigonal) crystal system is given by the general formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n### 3. Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane\nWhile we can substitute all values directly, the calculation is complex and prone to rounding errors. A better approach is to first simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane.\n- For `(hkl) = (111)`:\n  - `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n  - `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstitute these into the formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(3)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3\\sin^2\\alpha + 6\\cos^2\\alpha - 6\\cos\\alpha}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\nNow, simplify the numerator and denominator using trigonometric identities and factorization:\n- **Numerator:** Use `sin²α = 1 - cos²α`.\n  `3(1 - cos²α) + 6cos²α - 6cosα = 3 - 3cos²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα = 3cos²α - 6cosα + 3 = 3(cos²α - 2cosα + 1) = 3(1 - cosα)²`\n- **Denominator (volumetric term):** The term `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)` can be factored. Let `x = cosα`. The expression is `2x³ - 3x² + 1`. We can see that `x=1` is a root (`2-3+1=0`), so `(x-1)` is a factor. Polynomial division or synthetic division yields `(x-1)(2x² - x - 1)`, which further factors to `(x-1)(x-1)(2x+1) = (x-1)²(2x+1)`. In terms of `cosα`, this is `(cosα - 1)²(2cosα + 1)` or `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n\nSubstitute the simplified parts back into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\nThe `(1 - cosα)²` terms cancel out, leaving a much simpler formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\nThis simplified formula is specific to the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system and is much easier and more accurate to calculate.\n\n### 4. Perform the Calculation\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values into the simplified formula. To ensure precision, I will use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Description: This script calculates the interplanar distance for the (111) plane\n# of a rhombohedral crystal using the simplified formula derived from the general equation.\n\n# Given parameters\na = 10.0  # Interatomic distance in Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0 # Interaxial angle in degrees\n\n# Convert angle from degrees to radians for use in Python's math functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# The simplified formula for the (111) plane is:\n# 1/d^2 = 3 / (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha)))\n# Therefore, d^2 = (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha))) / 3\n\n# Calculate cos(alpha)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Calculate d^2\nd_squared = (a**2 * (1 + 2 * cos_alpha)) / 3\n\n# Calculate d by taking the square root\nd = math.sqrt(d_squared)\n\n# Print the final result, formatted to a few decimal places for clarity\nprint(f\"{d:.4f}\")\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 9.543 Angstrom.\n\n### 5.

Using a formula for a different system (like cubic or hexagonal) would lead to a completely incorrect answer.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** The most common source of minor errors among the candidate answers was the premature rounding of trigonometric values (e.g., using `cos(30°) ≈ 0.866`).

Select the Correct Formula**\nThe interplanar distance `d_hkl` for a rhombohedral crystal is given by the general formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n**3. Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane**\nFor the specific case of the (111) plane, where `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`, the formula can be greatly simplified. This is a robust method that reduces the chance of calculation errors.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstituting these values and performing algebraic simplification (as correctly shown by several candidate answers) reduces the formula to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing this simplified formula, we substitute the given values:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`, which means `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\nNow, we solve for `d_111`:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Conclude**\nThe calculated interplanar distance is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. We now compare this result to the original options provided in the question:\n*   A) 10.05 Angstrom\n*   B) 9.54 Angstrom\n*   C) 9.08 Angstrom\n*   D) 8.95 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom directly matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Formula Selection:** It is essential to use the specific formula for the rhombohedral crystal system, as it differs significantly from other systems like cubic or orthorhombic.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** The most reliable method is to simplify the formula algebraically before substituting numerical values. This avoids potential rounding errors that can occur when using decimal approximations for trigonometric functions in intermediate steps.\n*   **Option Matching:** An analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly calculated the numerical value to be ~9.54, many failed to select the correct corresponding letter. This was likely due to working with a scrambled list of options. It is crucial to match the final calculated value to the options as they were originally presented in the problem statement.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
