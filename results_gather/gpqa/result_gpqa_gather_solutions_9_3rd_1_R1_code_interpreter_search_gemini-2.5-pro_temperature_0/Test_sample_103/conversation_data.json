The magnitude of the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift, given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    *   **Proportionality:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom. For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   **Ratio:** The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where P is the orbital period, m_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Relationship:**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems, which allows for simplification:\n    *   The stars have identical masses (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   A standard and necessary assumption for this type of problem is that the orbital inclinations are comparable (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`). This is because the RV method measures the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, and the problem's phrasing implies this measured quantity is the same for both systems.\n    *   With all other terms being constant, the formula simplifies to a core relationship between K and P: `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the proportionality from Step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). To isolate this term, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (`K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`) into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which implies its host star is moving faster (K₂ > K₁). A faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which for a planet of similar mass, means it is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit has a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we must expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This immediately eliminates options C (~1.96) and D (~1.40).\n*   **Correct Exponent:** The relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` is crucial. A common mistake is to misuse the exponents in the final calculation. The final relationship is `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`, which requires cubing the ratio, not taking the cube root or any other power.\n*   **Correct Ratio:** It is easy to accidentally invert the ratio. Calculating `(7/5)³ ≈ 2.744` would yield the ratio `P₁ / P₂`. The question specifically asks for `P₂ / P₁`.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that \"similar masses\" detected via the RV method implies the measured quantity `m_p * sin(i)` is similar for both planets. This is necessary to arrive at a single numerical answer.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The candidate answers show universal agreement on the calculation, arriving at ~0.36. The primary source of error among them was matching this numerical result to the correct lettered option, as they appeared to be working with differently ordered lists. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, the calculated value of ~0.36 corresponds to option B.\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects the Doppler shift in a star's light caused by an orbiting planet. The magnitude of the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, a value denoted as K.\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ. For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ.\n    *   **Ratio:** The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    This formula is valid when the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), which is the case here.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Relationship**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems, which allows for simplification:\n    *   The stars have identical masses (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   A standard and necessary assumption for such problems is that the orbital inclinations (`i`) are comparable, meaning `sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`. This is because the RV method actually measures the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, and the problem's phrasing implies this measured value is the same for both.\n\n    With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n    *   **Simplified Proportionality:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine Relationships and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    We can now set up a ratio for the two systems using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). To find this, we must isolate the term by cubing both sides of the equation:\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Substitute the ratio of the K values (which is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values) from Step 1 into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which implies its host star is moving faster (K₂ > K₁). A faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which for a planet of similar mass, means it is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit has a *shorter* orbital period. Therefore, we must expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This immediately eliminates options A (~1.96) and D (~1.40).\n*   **Correct Proportionality and Exponents:** The core of the problem is correctly identifying that `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. This leads to the final calculation where the velocity ratio is cubed: `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`. It is a common mistake to use the wrong exponent or to invert the ratio.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that when planet masses are described as \"similar\" in an RV problem, it refers to the measured minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, being the same for both systems. This is necessary to arrive at a single numerical answer.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.36.

The problem connects the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) of a star's light to the orbital period (P) of a planet orbiting it.\n2.  **Analyze the Candidate Answers:** I will review the provided answers to find a consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical derivation.\n    *   **Physics Consensus:** All agents correctly identify that the wavelength shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` (i.e., `K ∝ Δλ`). They also correctly use the radial velocity formula `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`.\n    *   **Simplification Consensus:** Given that the star masses (`M_star`) and planet masses (`m_p`) are the same, and assuming the orbital inclinations (`i`) are comparable, all agents correctly simplify the relationship to `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n    *   **Mathematical Derivation Consensus:** All agents correctly derive the final formula for the ratio of the periods: `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3 = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`.\n    *   **Calculation Consensus:** All agents correctly calculate the numerical value: `(5 / 7)³ ≈ 0.3644`.\n    *   **Point of Disagreement:** The primary source of error and disagreement among the agents is matching the calculated value (~0.36) to the correct multiple-choice letter. This is because they seem to be referencing different or scrambled lists of options. I must ignore their final letter choices and rely solely on the options provided in the original question prompt.\n3.  **Formulate a Plan for the Code:**\n    *   Define variables for the two wavelength shifts, `Δλ₁ = 5` and `Δλ₂ = 7`.\n    *   Implement the derived formula: `period_ratio = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`.\n    *   Define a dictionary containing the options exactly as they are listed in the user's prompt: A) ~ 0.36, B) ~ 1.40, C) ~ 0.85, D) ~ 1.96.\n    *   Print the calculated result.\n    *   Print the list of options for clarity.\n    *   Compare the calculated result to the options to determine the closest match and state the final answer.\n4.  **Sanity Check:** A larger wavelength shift (planet #2) implies a larger stellar velocity (`K₂ > K₁`). A larger velocity is caused by a planet in a closer, and therefore shorter-period, orbit. This means `P₂` must be shorter than `P₁`, so the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. The calculated value of ~0.36 is less than 1, so the derivation is physically sound. This check eliminates options B and D.

The maximum value of this shift, given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** For planet #1, `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom. For planet #2, `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom.\n    *   **Ratio:** The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination. This formula is valid when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, as is the case here.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Relationship**\n    The problem states several conditions that are the same for both systems, allowing us to simplify the formula for comparison:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   A standard and necessary assumption for this type of problem is that the orbital inclinations (`i`) are comparable, so `sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`. This is because the RV method measures the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, and stating the planets are similar implies this measured quantity is also similar.\n\n    With `M_star`, `m_p`, and `sin(i)` being effectively constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core relationship between the velocity amplitude `K` and the orbital period `P`:\n    *   **Proportionality:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` (K is proportional to the inverse of the cube root of the period).\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Periods**\n    We can express the proportionality as a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`).

A faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which for a planet of similar mass, implies it is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit means a shorter orbital period (Kepler's Third Law). Therefore, we must expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check, immediately ruling out options B and C.\n*   **Algebra:** The most common mistake is inverting the ratio or using the wrong exponent.

This is because the RV method measures the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, and the problem's phrasing implies this measured quantity is the same for both systems.\n    *   With all other terms being constant, the formula simplifies to a core relationship between K and P: `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the proportionality from Step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). To isolate this term, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (`K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`) into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which implies its host star is moving faster (K₂ > K₁). A faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which for a planet of similar mass, means it is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit has a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we must expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1.

Based on the options provided in the question prompt, the calculated value of ~0.36 corresponds to option B.\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects the Doppler shift in a star's light caused by an orbiting planet. The magnitude of the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, a value denoted as K.\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ. For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ.\n    *   **Ratio:** The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    This formula is valid when the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), which is the case here.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Relationship**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems, which allows for simplification:\n    *   The stars have identical masses (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   A standard and necessary assumption for such problems is that the orbital inclinations (`i`) are comparable, meaning `sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`. This is because the RV method actually measures the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, and the problem's phrasing implies this measured value is the same for both.\n\n    With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n    *   **Simplified Proportionality:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine Relationships and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    We can now set up a ratio for the two systems using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). To find this, we must isolate the term by cubing both sides of the equation:\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Substitute the ratio of the K values (which is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values) from Step 1 into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which implies its host star is moving faster (K₂ > K₁). A faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which for a planet of similar mass, means it is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit has a *shorter* orbital period. Therefore, we must expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This immediately eliminates options A (~1.96) and D (~1.40).\n*   **Correct Proportionality and Exponents:** The core of the problem is correctly identifying that `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. This leads to the final calculation where the velocity ratio is cubed: `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`. It is a common mistake to use the wrong exponent or to invert the ratio.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that when planet masses are described as \"similar\" in an RV problem, it refers to the measured minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, being the same for both systems. This is necessary to arrive at a single numerical answer.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.36. It is crucial to match this result to the options provided in the original question prompt:\n    *   A) ~ 1.96\n    *   B) ~ 0.36\n    *   C) ~ 0.85\n    *   D) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first need to understand the core physics relationship described. The problem connects the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) of a star's light to the orbital period (P) of a planet orbiting it.\n2.  **Analyze the Candidate Answers:** I will review the provided answers to find a consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical derivation.\n    *   **Physics Consensus:** All agents correctly identify that the wavelength shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` (i.e., `K ∝ Δλ`). They also correctly use the radial velocity formula `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`.\n    *   **Simplification Consensus:** Given that the star masses (`M_star`) and planet masses (`m_p`) are the same, and assuming the orbital inclinations (`i`) are comparable, all agents correctly simplify the relationship to `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n    *   **Mathematical Derivation Consensus:** All agents correctly derive the final formula for the ratio of the periods: `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3 = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`.\n    *   **Calculation Consensus:** All agents correctly calculate the numerical value: `(5 / 7)³ ≈ 0.3644`.\n    *   **Point of Disagreement:** The primary source of error and disagreement among the agents is matching the calculated value (~0.36) to the correct multiple-choice letter. This is because they seem to be referencing different or scrambled lists of options. I must ignore their final letter choices and rely solely on the options provided in the original question prompt.\n3.  **Formulate a Plan for the Code:**\n    *   Define variables for the two wavelength shifts, `Δλ₁ = 5` and `Δλ₂ = 7`.\n    *   Implement the derived formula: `period_ratio = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`.\n    *   Define a dictionary containing the options exactly as they are listed in the user's prompt: A) ~ 0.36, B) ~ 1.40, C) ~ 0.85, D) ~ 1.96.\n    *   Print the calculated result.\n    *   Print the list of options for clarity.\n    *   Compare the calculated result to the options to determine the closest match and state the final answer.\n4.  **Sanity Check:** A larger wavelength shift (planet #2) implies a larger stellar velocity (`K₂ > K₁`). A larger velocity is caused by a planet in a closer, and therefore shorter-period, orbit. This means `P₂` must be shorter than `P₁`, so the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. The calculated value of ~0.36 is less than 1, so the derivation is physically sound. This check eliminates options B and D.

The maximum value of this shift, given in the problem, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's velocity curve, known as the semi-amplitude (K).\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom, Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   **Ratio:** The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Relationship**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are constant for both systems, allowing for a direct comparison:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star₁ = M_star₂`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂`).\n    *   A standard and necessary assumption for this type of problem is that the orbital inclinations are comparable (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`). This is because the RV method measures the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, and the problem's phrasing implies this observable quantity is the same for both systems.\n\n    With all other terms being constant, the formula simplifies to a core proportionality between K and P:\n    *   **Proportionality:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n    Using the proportionality from Step 3, we can set up an equation relating the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    Using the exponent rule `a⁻ⁿ / b⁻ⁿ = (b/a)ⁿ`, this simplifies to:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    The question asks for the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. To find this, we must isolate the term by cubing both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Substitute the ratio of the K values (which is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values) from Step 1 into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which implies its host star is moving faster (K₂ > K₁). A faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which for a planet of similar mass, implies it is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit means a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we must expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This immediately eliminates options A (~1.40) and C (~1.96).\n*   **Correct Exponents:** A common mistake is to misuse the exponents. The relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` correctly leads to the final calculation involving cubing the ratio, `(K₁/K₂)^3`, not taking the cube root or using another power.\n*   **Correct Ratio:** It is crucial to use the correct ratio to answer the question. The question asks for `P₂ / P₁`, which requires the calculation `(Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3`. Using the inverse ratio `(7/5)^3` would yield `2.744`, which is the ratio `P₁ / P₂`.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of `~0.36` must be carefully matched to the options provided in the original question prompt.\n    *   A) ~ 1.40\n    *   B) ~ 0.85\n    *   C) ~ 1.96\n    *   D) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.36 corresponds directly to option D.

Comparing this to the options provided in the question (A: ~1.96, B: ~0.36, C: ~1.40, D: ~0.85), the result clearly matches option B. The candidate answers show significant confusion in this final matching step, but the calculation itself is robustly consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The core principle of the Radial Velocity (RV) method is that the observed periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum value of this shift, given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Values:** Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom, Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   **Ratio of Amplitudes:** The ratio of the K values for the two stars is the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula, assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Relationship**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are constant for both systems:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star₁ = M_star₂`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂`).\n    *   A standard and necessary assumption for this type of problem is that the orbital inclinations are comparable (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`). This is because the RV method actually measures the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, and the problem's phrasing implies this measured quantity is the same for both.\n\n    With all other terms in the formula being constant, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and P:\n    *   **Simplified Proportionality:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n    We can now set up an equation using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). To find this, we must isolate the term by cubing both sides of the equation:\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Substitute the ratio of the K values (which is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values) from Step 1 into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which implies its host star is moving faster (`K₂ > K₁`). A faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which for a planet of similar mass, implies it is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit means a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we must expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This immediately eliminates options A (~1.40) and C (~1.96).\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** The cornerstone of the solution is correctly identifying the relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. Any other relationship would yield an incorrect answer.\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** It is crucial to correctly manipulate the exponents and ratios. The final relationship is `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`. A common mistake is to invert the ratio to `(K₂ / K₁)^3` or to use the wrong exponent, such as 1/3.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that \"similar masses\" in an RV problem implies the measured quantity `m_p * sin(i)` is the same for both systems, which is necessary to arrive at a single numerical answer.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The overwhelming consensus among the candidate answers is that the numerical result is ~0.36. The primary source of error in the candidate answers was incorrectly matching this number to the lettered options. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, the value ~0.36 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
