    "This question requires an understanding of molecular genetics, specifically how different types of mutations affect gene expression and protein function. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to inactivate a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional gene will not produce the compound.\n\nLet's analyze the effects of each mutation by comparing the mutant sequences to the intact gene sequence and translating them into amino acid sequences. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**1. Intact Gene Analysis**\n\n*   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Breaking it into codons:** ATG / TTT / CTC / GCT / GGT / ACT / ...\n*   **Translating to Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - Start codon\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Intact Protein Start:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - ...\n\nThe final goal is to disrupt this protein sequence as severely as possible to ensure it becomes non-functional.\n\n**2. Mutant Analysis**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence Change:** `...TTTCTC...` becomes `...TTCTAC...`\n    *   **Codon Change:** The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`. The third codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation** because `TTT` and `TTC` both code for the same amino acid.\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation** because `CTC` (Leucine) is replaced by `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein has one amino acid changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence Change:** `...TTTCTC...` becomes `...TTCTAA...`\n    *   **Codon Change:** The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`. The third codon `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). (Silent mutation)\n        *   `TAA` -> **STOP**. This is a **nonsense mutation** because a codon for an amino acid (`CTC` for Leucine) has been changed to a stop codon.\n    *   **Effect:** This mutation causes the ribosome to stop translation prematurely. The resulting \"protein\" would only be two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A severely truncated protein like this is almost certain to be completely non-functional. This is the most effective way to \"knock out\" a gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence Change:** This sequence has multiple changes. Let's align and compare the codons.\n        *   Intact: `CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT`\n        *   Mutant: `TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`\n    *   **Codon Change:** `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr), `ACT` -> `GTC` (Thr -> Val), `TCT` -> `ACT` (Ser -> Thr).\n    *   **Effect:** This represents multiple **missense mutations**. While changing several amino acids increases the chance of disrupting the protein's function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence Change:** Let's align the sequences.\n        *   Intact: `...CTCGCTGGTACT...`\n        *   Mutant: `...TACGCT--ACT...`\n    *   **Codon Change:** The codon `CTC` is changed to `TAC` (a missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr), and the codon `GGT` (coding for Glycine) is deleted.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion**. Deleting one full codon removes one amino acid from the protein chain without altering the downstream reading frame. While this will likely impact protein folding and function, it is generally less disruptive than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the potential outcomes:\n*   **Mutant 1 (Missense):** Low probability of knockout.\n*   **Mutant 2 (Nonsense):** Very high probability of knockout due to a premature stop codon creating a tiny, non-functional peptide.\n*   **Mutant 3 (Multiple Missense):** Moderate probability of knockout.\n*   **Mutant 4 (Deletion + Missense):** Moderate probability of knockout.\n\nThe mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is the one that is most likely to create a non-functional protein. The introduction of a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) early in the gene, as seen in Mutant 2, is the most reliable way to achieve this.\n\n<<<B>>>"
