    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State (at t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B = -μ_z * B = -γ * B * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ * B * (ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γ * B * (-ħ/2) = +γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lower energy state is `|+z⟩`. Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian (for t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * B * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting the new Hamiltonian, we get:\n        `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ * ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   Let's calculate `⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\n5.  **Method 1: Larmor Precession**\n    *   A classical and semi-classical approach involves the Larmor precession equation for the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩`:\n        `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ * (⟨S⟩ × B)`\n    *   Here, `B = (0, B, 0)`. The equation becomes:\n        `d/dt (⟨S_x⟩, ⟨S_y⟩, ⟨S_z⟩) = γ * (⟨S_y⟩*0 - ⟨S_z⟩*B, ⟨S_z⟩*0 - ⟨S_x⟩*0, ⟨S_x⟩*B - ⟨S_y⟩*0)`\n    *   This gives a set of coupled differential equations:\n        1.  `d⟨S_x⟩/dt = -γB⟨S_z⟩`\n        2.  `d⟨S_y⟩/dt = 0`\n        3.  `d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γB⟨S_x⟩`\n    *   To find the oscillation of `⟨S_z⟩`, we can differentiate equation (3) with respect to time:\n        `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * d⟨S_x⟩/dt`\n    *   Now substitute equation (1) into this:\n        `d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩`\n    *   This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`. By comparing the two, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` as:\n        `ω = γB`\n\n6.  **Method 2: Full Quantum Mechanical Calculation**\n    *   We need to evaluate `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n    *   The operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle is `(ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(i(γBt/ħ)(ħ/2)σ_y) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_k`, where `θ = γBt/2` and `k=y`:\n        `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ_y = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   The initial state is `|+z⟩ = [[1], [0]]`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|+z⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now we calculate the expectation value `⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`. The `S_z` operator is `(ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This is a cosine function of time. The general form is `A cos(ωt + φ)`. By inspection, the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth methods show that the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
