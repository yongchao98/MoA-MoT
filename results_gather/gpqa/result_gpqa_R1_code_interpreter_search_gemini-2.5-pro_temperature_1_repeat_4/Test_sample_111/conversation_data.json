    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the Initial State |α>\n\nThe given state is `|α> ∝ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`.\nLet the normalized state be `|α> = N * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`.\nThe normalization condition is `<α|α> = 1`.\n\nThe bra corresponding to `|α>` is `<α| = N* * [(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|]`.\nAssuming N is real, `N* = N`.\n\n`<α|α> = N² * [< (1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down| >] * [<(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> >]`\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis states (`<up|up> = 1`, `<down|down> = 1`, `<up|down> = 0`), we get:\n`<α|α> = N² * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ]`\n`<α|α> = N² * [ (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) ]`\n`<α|α> = N² * [ (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) ]`\n`<α|α> = N² * [ 2 + 5 ] = 7N²`\n\nSince `<α|α> = 1`, we have `7N² = 1`, which gives `N = 1/√7`.\nSo, the normalized state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn vector notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, the state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A and Find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. This is a 2x2 matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(hbar/2)` times the Pauli-X matrix (`σ_x`).\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2**:\n    `(A - λ₁I) |v₁> = 0`\n    `[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] [x, y]^T = [0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]^T`.\n    Normalizing it gives `|v₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1]^T = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2**:\n    `(A - λ₂I) |v₂> = 0`\n    `[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] [x, y]^T = [0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]^T`.\n    Normalizing it gives `|v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]^T = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ_i` is given by `P(λ_i) = |<v_i|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +hbar/2**:\n    `<v₁|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)*(1+i) + (1)*(2-i) ]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ 1 + i + 2 - i ] = 3/√14`\n    `P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -hbar/2**:\n    `<v₂|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)*(1+i) + (-1)*(2-i) ]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ 1 + i - 2 + i ] = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n    `P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14`\n\nChecking the probabilities: `9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\nConverting to decimals:\n`P(λ₁) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n`P(λ₂) = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\nThese correspond to probabilities of `0.64` and `0.36` (rounding to two decimal places).\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average Value of the Operator\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: `<A> = Σ λ_i * P(λ_i)`**\n    `<A> = (λ₁) * P(λ₁) + (λ₂) * P(λ₂)`\n    `<A> = (+hbar/2) * (9/14) + (-hbar/2) * (5/14)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7) = hbar/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: `<A> = <α|A|α>`**\n    First, calculate `A|α>`:\n    `A|α> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n    `A|α> = (hbar / (2√7)) * [ (2-i), (1+i) ]^T`\n    Now, calculate `<α|A|α>`:\n    `<α|A|α> = (1/√7) * [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * (hbar / (2√7)) * [ (2-i), (1+i) ]^T`\n    `<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ (2 - 2i - i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ 2 ] = hbar / 7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
