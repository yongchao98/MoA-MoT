    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It has **no α-hydrogens**.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one **α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the ketone at the C6 position to form the enolate. The negative charge is delocalized between C6 and the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The structure of the added group is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   The resulting product structure has the -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product A:**\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. The main chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`, which means a cyclohexyl ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain. This matches our connectivity: `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   Now, we need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules for such complex substituents, the ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment.\n    *   Let's re-number the cyclohexanone ring for naming the substituent:\n        *   **New C1:** This is the old C6, the point of attachment. It has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **New C2:** This is the old C1. It has the **oxo** (=O) group.\n        *   **New C3:** This is the old C2. It has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for product A in options C and D.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) are acidic. This will be the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon from the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon (the CH group bonded to the methyl group) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the original butene chain.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Naming the Product B:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated (by H₂O) to give the final product.\n    *   Let's assemble the structure: `(CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)) - (CH(CH₃)CH₂(α)CN)`.\n    *   The linear structure is: **CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN**.\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name for product B in options B and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The analysis of Reaction A leads to the product **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options A and B.\n*   The analysis of Reaction B leads to the product **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with both analyses is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
