    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies there is an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    *   Change in principal quantum number $\\Delta n$: any integer.\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   Initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = m \\pm (0,1) = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options provided in the question suggest that the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is also the most probable transition.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Initial intermediate state has $l'=1$. Final state has $l=0$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n        *   For each possible $m'$, we check $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$.\n            *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n            *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n            *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n        *   All three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Determine the possible decay routes:**\n    Based on the selection rules, there are three possible cascade routes through the $n=2$ shell:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability (branching ratio) for each route:**\n    The probability of a particular route is determined by the branching ratio of the first step. This is because the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ has only one possible decay channel via a single dipole transition (to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state), so the branching ratio for the second step is 1 for all three routes.\n\n    The branching ratio for the first step, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$, is the ratio of the partial decay rate for that specific channel to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The decay rate for a transition $|i\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    Rate$(|i\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle) \\propto \\omega^3 |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = \\omega^3 (|\\langle f|x|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|y|i\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f|z|i\\rangle|^2)$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). In spontaneous emission from a spherically symmetric state, there is no preferred direction. Therefore, the emission populates the magnetic sublevels of the final state equally.\n\n    Let's verify this by calculation. The rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ depends on the radial integral $\\mathcal{R} = \\int R_{21}(r) r^3 R_{30}(r) dr$ and an angular part.\n    *   **Rate for $m'=0$:** The transition is $\\Delta m=0$, governed by the $z$ operator ($z=r\\cos\\theta$). The squared angular matrix element is $|\\langle Y_{1,0} | \\cos\\theta | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 = 1/3$.\n    *   **Rate for $m'=\\pm 1$:** The transitions are $\\Delta m=\\pm 1$, governed by the $x$ and $y$ operators ($x \\pm iy = r\\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}$). The sum of squared angular matrix elements is $|\\langle Y_{1,\\pm 1} | x | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle Y_{1,\\pm 1} | y | Y_{0,0} \\rangle|^2 = 1/3$.\n\n    So, the decay rates for transitions to each of the three intermediate states are equal:\n    Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle$)\n\n    Let this rate be $A_0$. The total decay rate (to the $n=2, l=1$ level) is the sum of these three rates:\n    $A_{total} = A_0 + A_0 + A_0 = 3A_0$.\n\n    The probability (branching ratio) for any one of these paths is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } m') = \\frac{\\text{Rate to } |2,1,m'\\rangle}{A_{total}} = \\frac{A_0}{3A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability, though the route is valid)\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability, though the route is valid)\n\n    The only option that matches our derivation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
