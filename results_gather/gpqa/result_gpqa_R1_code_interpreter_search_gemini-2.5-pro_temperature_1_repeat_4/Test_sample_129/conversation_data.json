    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core physical principle:** The problem involves the concept of cosmological redshift. Due to the expansion of the universe, light emitted from distant objects like quasars is stretched to longer wavelengths. The amount of this stretching is quantified by the redshift, `z`.\n\n2.  **Recall the redshift formula:** The relationship between the emitted (rest-frame) wavelength `λ_rest` and the observed wavelength `λ_obs` is given by:\n    `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n    This can be rearranged to solve for the redshift `z`:\n    `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`\n\n3.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen is given as `λ_rest = 1216 Å` (Angstroms). This line is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n\n4.  **Determine the observational constraint:** The problem states that the detection is done with \"optical ground-based telescopes\".\n    *   Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation. It absorbs wavelengths shorter than about 320-350 nanometers (nm), which is 3200-3500 Å.\n    *   Therefore, for a spectral line to be detected by a ground-based telescope, its observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) must be greater than this atmospheric cutoff.\n    *   The question asks for the *lower limit* on the redshift. This means we are looking for the minimum `z` that shifts the 1216 Å line just past this atmospheric UV absorption and into the observable \"optical window\". We need to find the `z` that corresponds to `λ_obs` being at the very blue/UV-end of what's observable from the ground.\n\n5.  **Set up the calculation for the minimum redshift:**\n    *   We need to find the `z_min` such that `λ_obs` is at the minimum observable wavelength, `λ_obs_min`.\n    *   `z_min = (λ_obs_min / λ_rest) - 1`\n    *   Let's use a reasonable value for the atmospheric cutoff, say `λ_obs_min ≈ 3500 Å` (or 350 nm). This is a standard, realistic value for the effective limit of ground-based optical astronomy.\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   `z_min = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1`\n    *   `z_min ≈ 2.878 - 1`\n    *   `z_min ≈ 1.878`\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 1.9\n    *   B) 1.2\n    *   C) 3.0\n    *   D) 2.4\n\n    The calculated value `z_min ≈ 1.878` is extremely close to option A) 1.9.\n\n8.  **Verify the chosen answer:** We can work backwards from the options to see what observed wavelength they correspond to.\n    *   **For z = 1.9 (Option A):** `λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 * 2.9 = 3526.4 Å`. This wavelength (352.6 nm) is just past the atmospheric cutoff and is observable, making it a plausible lower limit.\n    *   **For z = 1.2 (Option B):** `λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + 1.2) = 1216 * 2.2 = 2675.2 Å`. This wavelength (267.5 nm) is deep in the UV and is completely blocked by the atmosphere. This redshift is too low.\n    *   **For z = 2.4 (Option D):** `λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + 2.4) = 4134.4 Å`. This is well within the observable range, but it is not the *lower limit*. An object with a lower redshift (like z=1.9) could also be seen.\n    *   **For z = 3.0 (Option C):** `λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + 3.0) = 4864 Å`. This is also easily observable and not the lower limit.\n\nTherefore, the redshift must be at least ~1.9 for the Lyman-alpha line to be shifted into the optical window accessible from the ground.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, a Python script can be used.\n```python\n# Rest-frame wavelength of Lyman-alpha in Angstroms\nlambda_rest = 1216\n\n# Atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based optical telescopes.\n# A realistic value is around 3500 Angstroms (350 nm).\nlambda_obs_min = 3500\n\n# Calculate the minimum redshift required\nz_min = (lambda_obs_min / lambda_rest) - 1\nprint(f\"Calculated minimum redshift using a cutoff of {lambda_obs_min} Angstroms: {z_min:.3f}\")\n\n# Check the observed wavelength for the redshift in option A\nz_A = 1.9\nlambda_obs_A = lambda_rest * (1 + z_A)\nprint(f\"For z = {z_A}, the observed wavelength is {lambda_obs_A:.1f} Angstroms.\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> ```\n> Calculated minimum redshift using a cutoff of 3500 Angstroms: 1.878\n> For z = 1.9, the observed wavelength is 3526.4 Angstroms.\n> ```\nThe calculation confirms that a redshift of ~1.9 shifts the Lyman-alpha line to ~3526 Å, which is a textbook value for the shortest wavelength observable with ground-based telescopes.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem requires us to find the minimum redshift (`z`) for an object so that its Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line, which has a rest-frame wavelength (`λ_rest`) of 1216 Å, can be observed by a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n1.  **Identify the key constraint:** The primary limitation for ground-based optical telescopes is the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is opaque to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, absorbing most light with wavelengths shorter than about 3500 Å (or 350 nm). Therefore, for the Lyα line to be detected, its wavelength must be redshifted to a value greater than this atmospheric cutoff.\n\n2.  **Use the redshift formula:** The relationship between the observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) and the rest-frame wavelength (`λ_rest`) is given by the cosmological redshift formula:\n    `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n\n3.  **Set up the calculation for the lower limit:** We are looking for the *lower limit* on the redshift. This corresponds to the case where the observed wavelength is equal to the minimum wavelength that can pass through the atmosphere.\n    *   `λ_rest` = 1216 Å\n    *   `λ_obs_min` ≈ 3500 Å (a typical value for the atmospheric cutoff)\n\n    We can solve for the minimum redshift, `z_min`:\n    `z_min = (λ_obs_min / λ_rest) - 1`\n\n4.  **Calculate the value:**\n    `z_min = (3500 / 1216) - 1`\n    `z_min ≈ 2.878 - 1`\n    `z_min ≈ 1.878`\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) 1.9\n    B) 1.2\n    C) 3.0\n    D) 2.4\n\n    The calculated value of `z_min ≈ 1.878` is extremely close to option A, which is 1.9. A redshift of 1.9 would shift the Lyα line to `1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 Å`, which is just above the atmospheric cutoff and therefore observable. Any significantly lower redshift would result in an observed wavelength that is blocked by the atmosphere.\n\n<<<A>>>"
