    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the star's properties and the planet's distance from it. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)\n    T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant. It also specifies that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    This simplifies the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Data:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method: the Doppler shift (Δλ) of a stellar spectral line. The Doppler shift is caused by the star's wobble as the planet orbits it.\n\n5.  **Connect Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max) is related to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) by the formula:\n    K = (Δλ_max / λ₀) * c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (Δλ₁ / λ₀ * c) / (Δλ₂ / λ₀ * c) = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n    Given Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å and Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å:\n    K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n6.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Semi-Major Axis (a):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant. (We assume an edge-on orbit, sin(i)=1, as is common for planets detected by both transit and RV methods, and because the problem gives the maximum shift).\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We need to rearrange the formula to express `a` in terms of K and other variables.\n    K² = (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K² = (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a = (M_p² * G) / (M_star * K²)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁):**\n    a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_p₂² * G) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (M_p₁² * G) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n    The terms G and M_star are constant for both planets and cancel out:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²)\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n9.  **Substitute the Known Ratios:**\n    *   Mass ratio: M_p₁ = 7 M_earth, M_p₂ = 5 M_earth => M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7\n    *   RV amplitude ratio: K₁ / K₂ = 3 / 4\n\n    Now substitute these into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Ratios ---\n# Mass of Planet 2 to Planet 1\nmass_ratio_2_to_1 = 5 / 7\n\n# Maximum Doppler shift of Planet 1 to Planet 2\ndoppler_shift_ratio_1_to_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# --- Derivations ---\n# The radial velocity amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ).\n# So, the ratio of the amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the shifts.\nK_ratio_1_to_2 = doppler_shift_ratio_1_to_2\n\n# The semi-major axis 'a' can be related to K and planet mass M_p by:\n# a is proportional to (M_p / K)^2\n# Therefore, the ratio a2 / a1 is given by:\n# a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\na_ratio_2_to_1 = (mass_ratio_2_to_1)**2 * (K_ratio_1_to_2)**2\n\n# The equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).\n# Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\ntemp_ratio_1_to_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_to_1)\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio_1_to_2:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
