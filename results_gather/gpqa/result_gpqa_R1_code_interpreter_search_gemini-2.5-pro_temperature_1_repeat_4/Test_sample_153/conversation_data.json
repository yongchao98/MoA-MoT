    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires integrating information from multiple spectroscopic techniques. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the data provided.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak, has a relative abundance of about 32% (100% for 156, 32% for 158). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive signature for the presence of a single **chlorine atom** in the molecule. (Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of ~75% and ~25%, respectively).\n\nSo, we are looking for a chlorine-containing compound with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl).\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weight of the proposed structures using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl).\n```python\n# Molecular weights of elements (most common isotopes)\nC = 12\nH = 1\nO = 16\nCl = 35\n\n# A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C7H5ClO2)\nmw_A = 7 * C + 5 * H + 1 * Cl + 2 * O\nprint(f\"Molecular weight of A (C7H5ClO2): {mw_A}\")\n\n# B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C7H5ClO2)\nmw_B = 7 * C + 5 * H + 1 * Cl + 2 * O\nprint(f\"Molecular weight of B (C7H5ClO2): {mw_B}\")\n\n# C) Phenyl chloroformate (C7H5ClO2)\nmw_C = 7 * C + 5 * H + 1 * Cl + 2 * O\nprint(f\"Molecular weight of C (C7H5ClO2): {mw_C}\")\n\n# D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C7H5ClO2)\nmw_D = 7 * C + 5 * H + 1 * Cl + 2 * O\nprint(f\"Molecular weight of D (C7H5ClO2): {mw_D}\")\n```\n>>>\nMolecular weight of A (C7H5ClO2): 156\nMolecular weight of B (C7H5ClO2): 156\nMolecular weight of C (C7H5ClO2): 156\nMolecular weight of D (C7H5ClO2): 156\n>>>\nAll four options have the correct molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) and molecular weight to match the mass spectrometry data. Therefore, we must rely on the other spectra to distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\nThis IR evidence strongly suggests the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options A (an aldehyde/phenol) and C (a chloroformate), which would not show the broad O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. We are now left with options B and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (highly deshielded) is typical for an acidic proton. A chemical shift around 10-13 ppm is classic for a **carboxylic acid proton**. The 's' indicates it's a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with), and '1H' means it corresponds to one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The key information here is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each integrating to two protons (2H). Each signal is a doublet ('d'), meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   This symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. In such a ring, there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent.\n\nLet's examine the remaining options:\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly the symmetrical pattern observed: two doublets, each for 2H.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2- (ortho) substituted benzene ring. This structure is not symmetrical and would have four unique aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern (likely four distinct multiplets), not two clean doublets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the spectral data:\n*   **MS** tells us the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **IR** identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals a 1,4-disubstituted (para) aromatic ring structure.\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>",
