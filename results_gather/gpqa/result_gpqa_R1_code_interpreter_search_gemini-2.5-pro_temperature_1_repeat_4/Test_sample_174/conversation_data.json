    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Source and the Radiation**\n\nThe problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroidal shape, symmetric around the z-axis. An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. In the far-field (radiation zone), the properties of this radiation can be described by a multipole expansion of the source. The dominant radiation comes from the lowest-order non-zero multipole moment. The main candidates are the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, and electric quadrupole.\n\n**2. Model the Radiation as Electric Dipole Radiation**\n\nThis is the most common and fundamental type of radiation from a localized oscillating charge. Unless specific symmetries are imposed to cancel it out, the electric dipole term is typically the strongest. Let's assume the charge oscillates along the symmetry (z) axis, creating an oscillating electric dipole moment `p(t)` along the z-axis.\n\n*   **Angular Dependence:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle with respect to the z-axis.\n\n*   **Finding the Maximum Power (A):** The function `sin²(θ)` has its maximum value of 1 when `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis). The problem states that this maximum radiated power per unit solid angle is `A`.\n    So, `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\n*   **Calculating the Power at θ = 30°:** We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We substitute this angle into the formula:\n    `Power at 30° ∝ sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n*   **Finding the Fraction:** The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n    `Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power A) = (proportionality constant * 1/4) / (proportionality constant * 1) = 1/4`.\n\nThis result eliminates options C and D.\n\n**3. Determine the Wavelength (λ) Dependence**\n\nNow we need to find the dependence of the function `f` on the wavelength `λ`.\n\n*   The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the square of the second time derivative of the dipole moment. For an oscillation with angular frequency `ω`, the dipole moment is `p(t) ∝ cos(ωt)`, and its second derivative is `d²p/dt² ∝ -ω²cos(ωt)`.\n*   The radiated fields are proportional to `d²p/dt²`, so `E ∝ ω²`.\n*   The radiated power (Poynting vector magnitude) is proportional to `E²`. Therefore, the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to `(ω²)² = ω⁴`.\n    `f ∝ ω⁴`.\n*   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n*   Substituting this into our proportionality:\n    `f ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n\nSo, a possible form for `f` includes a `λ⁻⁴` dependence. This is the famous dependence found in Rayleigh scattering, which is why the sky is blue.\n\n**4. Combine the Results and Choose the Correct Option**\n\n*   Fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n*   Possible dependence on wavelength is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nCombining these two results, we get (1/4, λ⁻⁴). This matches option B.\n\n**Alternative Consideration (Electric Quadrupole Radiation):**\nOne might wonder if the radiation is of the electric quadrupole type, as a spheroid has a natural quadrupole moment.\n*   **Angular Dependence:** For a linear quadrupole along the z-axis, `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. The maximum is at `θ=45°`. The fraction at `30°` would be `[sin²(30)cos²(30)] / [sin²(45)cos²(45)] = [(1/4)(3/4)] / [(1/2)(1/2)] = (3/16)/(1/4) = 3/4`.\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** Quadrupole radiation power is proportional to `ω⁶`, which means `λ⁻⁶`.\nThis corresponds to option C, (3/4, λ⁻⁶).\n\n**Conclusion:** Both B and C describe possible physical radiation scenarios. However, dipole radiation is the lowest-order and typically dominant form of radiation from a generic oscillating charge. Quadrupole radiation is weaker by a factor of `(d/λ)²` (where d is the source size) and only dominates if the dipole moment is zero due to symmetry. As the problem describes a general \"oscillating charge distribution\" without specifying such a symmetry, the most natural and \"possible\" form to consider is the electric dipole radiation.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
