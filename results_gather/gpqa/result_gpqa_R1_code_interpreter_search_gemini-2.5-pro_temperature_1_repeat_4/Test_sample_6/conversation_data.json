    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) to interact with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) and produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). The reaction is:\n\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$\n\nThis process is a classic example of pair production from photon-photon annihilation. We can solve this by considering the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum.\n\nLet the four-momenta of the particles be:\n*   High-energy gamma-ray: $P_{\\gamma} = (E_{\\gamma}, \\vec{p}_{\\gamma})$\n*   CMB photon: $P_{\\epsilon} = (\\epsilon, \\vec{p}_{\\epsilon})$\n*   Electron: $P_{e^-}$\n*   Positron: $P_{e^+}$\n\nHere, $E_{\\gamma}$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, and $\\epsilon$ is the energy of the CMB photon. The rest mass of both the electron and the positron is $m_e$. We will use natural units where the speed of light $c=1$.\n\nThe conservation of four-momentum states:\n$P_{\\gamma} + P_{\\epsilon} = P_{e^-} + P_{e^+}$\n\nA useful technique is to square the total four-momentum, as this quantity (the Mandelstam variable $s$) is Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames of reference.\n\n$s = (P_{\\gamma} + P_{\\epsilon})^2 = (P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2$\n\nLet's evaluate the left side in the lab frame (where we observe the collision). For photons, the square of their four-momentum is zero ($P^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = 0$).\n$(P_{\\gamma} + P_{\\epsilon})^2 = P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{\\epsilon}^2 + 2 P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{\\epsilon} = 0 + 0 + 2 (E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{\\epsilon})$\nSince $|\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}| = E_{\\gamma}$ and $|\\vec{p}_{\\epsilon}| = \\epsilon$, the dot product is $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{\\epsilon} = E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\nSo, $s = 2E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the right side at the threshold energy. The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. In the center-of-mass (CM) frame, this corresponds to the electron and positron being created at rest.\nIn the CM frame at threshold:\n*   Electron momentum: $\\vec{p}_{e^-} = 0$, Energy: $E_{e^-} = m_e$\n*   Positron momentum: $\\vec{p}_{e^+} = 0$, Energy: $E_{e^+} = m_e$\nThe total four-momentum of the final state in the CM frame is $P_{final, CM} = (m_e + m_e, \\vec{0}) = (2m_e, \\vec{0})$.\nThe square of this is $(P_{final, CM})^2 = (2m_e)^2 = 4m_e^2$.\n\nSince $s$ is Lorentz invariant, we can equate the expressions from the lab frame and the CM frame:\n$2E_{\\gamma}\\epsilon(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4m_e^2$\n\nWe are looking for the threshold energy $E_{\\gamma, th}$. To initiate the reaction, the incoming gamma-ray must have at least this energy. The energy required is lowest when the interaction is most efficient. From the equation, $E_{\\gamma}$ is minimized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This occurs for a head-on collision, where the photons travel towards each other, so $\\theta = \\pi$ and $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\nIn this case, $(1 - \\cos\\pi) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nThe equation for the minimum threshold energy becomes:\n$2E_{\\gamma, th}\\epsilon(2) = 4m_e^2$\n$4E_{\\gamma, th}\\epsilon = 4m_e^2$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{m_e^2}{\\epsilon}$\n\nNow, we plug in the given and known values:\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Rest mass of an electron, $m_e = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, represents the energy threshold above which high-energy gamma-rays have their mean free path (and thus their \"lifetime\" in the universe) significantly limited by pair production with CMB photons. This phenomenon is known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) limit for photons.\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nD) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
