    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics Principle:** The problem is about a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. A fundamental principle is the **normalization condition**. It states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the entire space where it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\n2.  **Define Probability Density:** The probability of finding a particle in a small region `dx` is given by `|ψ(x)|² dx`, where `|ψ(x)|²` is the probability density. `|ψ(x)|²` is calculated as the product of the wave function `ψ(x)` and its complex conjugate `ψ*(x)`.\n\n3.  **Find the Complex Conjugate:**\n    *   The given wave function is: `ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i`\n    *   To find the complex conjugate `ψ*(x)`, we change the sign of the imaginary part (`i` term).\n    *   So, `ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability Density `|ψ(x)|²`:**\n    *   `|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)`\n    *   `|ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]`\n    *   This is in the form `(A + B)(A - B) = A² - B²`, where `A = a / sqrt(1 + x)` and `B = 0.5*i`.\n    *   `|ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5*i)²`\n    *   `|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)`\n    *   Since `i² = -1`, the expression becomes:\n    *   `|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)`\n    *   `|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n\n5.  **Set up the Normalization Integral:**\n    *   The problem states that the particle is only found between `x=1` and `x=3`. This means we must integrate the probability density over this interval, and the result must be 1.\n    *   The normalization equation is: `∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1`\n    *   Substituting the expression for `|ψ(x)|²`:\n    *   `∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1`\n\n6.  **Solve the Integral:**\n    *   We can split the integral into two parts:\n    *   `∫ ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx`\n    *   The integral of `a² / (1 + x)` is `a² * ln(1 + x)`.\n    *   The integral of `0.25` is `0.25 * x`.\n    *   So, the definite integral is: `[ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x ]` evaluated from `x=1` to `x=3`.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:**\n    *   Evaluate at the upper limit (x=3): `a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 = a² * ln(4) + 0.75`\n    *   Evaluate at the lower limit (x=1): `a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 = a² * ln(2) + 0.25`\n    *   Subtract the lower limit value from the upper limit value:\n    *   `(a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1`\n    *   `a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1`\n    *   `a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B)`:\n    *   `a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1`\n    *   `a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n\n8.  **Solve for the constant `a`:**\n    *   `a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5`\n    *   `a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n    *   `a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n    *   `a = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    To get the precise numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The derived equation for a^2 is 0.5 / ln(2)\na_squared = 0.5 / math.log(2)\n\n# The value of 'a' is the square root of a^2\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(a)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8493266536315729\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value of `a` is approximately 0.8493.\n\n10. **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 0.35\n    *   B) 0.6\n    *   C) 0.85\n    *   D) 1.1\n\nThe calculated value `0.8493` is extremely close to `0.85`.\n\n<<<C>>>",
