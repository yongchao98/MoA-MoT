    "An L-loop Feynman diagram in D-dimensional spacetime involves L independent integrations over loop momenta. In the standard dimensional regularization scheme, each loop integral of the form ∫d^D k/(2π)^D contributes a factor proportional to 1/(4π)^(D/2) after performing the angular integration.\n\nFor a D=4 spacetime, this means each loop contributes a factor of 1/(4π)^(4/2) = 1/(4π)^2.\n\nTherefore, for an L-loop diagram, the total factor from the loop integrations will be:\n\n(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\nalpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2\n\nWe can identify the loop factor part of this expression as 1/(4pi)^6.\n\nBy comparing this with the general formula, we can set the exponents equal to each other to find the number of loops L:\n2L = 6\n\nSolving for L, we get:\nL = 6 / 2\nL = 3\n\nThe other factors in the expression (alpha^3, g^2, sqrt(2), 8, (Q/M)^2) relate to the number and type of vertices (couplings), symmetry factors, and the result of the momentum integration, but the power of (4π) is the most direct and reliable indicator of the number of loops.\n\nThus, the diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<A>>>"
