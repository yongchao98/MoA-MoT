    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density (`\\mathcal{L}`)**\n\nIn natural units, where `ħ = c = 1`, the action `S` is dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density over spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d⁴x \\mathcal{L}`\nThe mass dimension of the spacetime differential `d⁴x` is `[d⁴x]_M = -4` (since `[x]_M = -1`).\nFor `S` to be dimensionless (`[S]_M = 0`), the Lagrangian density `\\mathcal{L}` must have a mass dimension of `[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4`.\n\n**2. Determine the mass dimensions of the fields (`ψ` and `F^{\\mu\\nu}`)**\n\nWe can find the mass dimensions of the fields by looking at their standard kinetic terms, which must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n*   **Fermion field `ψ`**: The kinetic term for a fermion is `\\mathcal{L}_{fermion} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi`.\n    The dimension of the derivative term `\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi` must be 4. The gamma matrices `\\gamma^\\mu` are dimensionless. The derivative `\\partial_\\mu` has a mass dimension `[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1`.\n    `[\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M = 4`\n    Since `[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M`, we have:\n    `2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4`\n    `2[\\psi]_M = 3`\n    `[\\psi]_M = 3/2`\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor `F^{\\mu\\nu}`**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `\\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -1/4 F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}`.\n    The dimension of this term must be 4:\n    `[F_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4`\n    `2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4`\n    `[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2`\n\n**3. Determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant (`κ`)**\n\nNow, we analyze the interaction term `\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}`. This term, being part of the Lagrangian density, must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n`[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = 4`\n\nLet's find the dimension of each component in the term:\n*   `[\\kappa]_M`: This is what we need to find.\n*   `[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M = 3/2`\n*   `[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M`: `\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}` is defined as `(i/2)[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]`. Since the gamma matrices `\\gamma_\\mu` are dimensionless, `\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}` is also dimensionless. So, `[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0`.\n*   `[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2`\n\nNow we set the total dimension of the interaction term to 4:\n`[\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4`\n`[\\kappa]_M + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4`\n`[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4`\n`[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4`\n`[\\kappa]_M = -1`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n\n**4. Determine the renormalizability of the theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be assessed (by a rule of thumb called power-counting) from the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If all coupling constants `g` have `[g]_M ≥ 0`, the theory is renormalizable (or super-renormalizable if `[g]_M > 0`).\n*   If any coupling constant `g` has `[g]_M < 0`, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant `κ` has a mass dimension of -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is non-renormalizable. In quantum field theory, such terms with negative mass dimension couplings correspond to higher-dimension operators that are suppressed at low energies and typically arise in effective field theories.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of `κ` is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
