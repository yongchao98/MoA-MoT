Identify the Nucleus and its Properties**\n*   The element is Lithium (Li). The atomic number of Lithium is Z = 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   The problem states the nucleus has 3 neutrons (N = 3).\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus in question is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Mass of the ⁶Li Nucleus (m₀)**\nTo find the total relativistic energy, we first need the rest energy (E₀ = m₀c²), which requires the rest mass of the nucleus. The most accurate way to find this is to take the known atomic mass of a ⁶Li atom and subtract the mass of its electrons.\n*   Atomic mass of a neutral ⁶Li atom: `m_atom ≈ 6.0151228 u` (atomic mass units).\n*   Mass of an electron: `m_electron ≈ 0.00054858 u`.\n*   A neutral ⁶Li atom has 3 protons and 3 electrons. We subtract the mass of the 3 electrons from the atomic mass to get the nuclear mass:\n    `m₀ = m_atom - 3 * m_electron`\n    `m₀ = 6.0151228 u - 3 * 0.00054858 u`\n    `m₀ = 6.0151228 u - 0.00164574 u`\n    `m₀ = 6.01347706 u`\n\n**3. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀)**\nWe convert the rest mass from atomic mass units (u) to Giga-electron Volts (GeV) using the conversion factor: `1 u ≈ 931.494 MeV/c²` or `0.931494 GeV/c²`.\n*   `E₀ = m₀ * c²`\n*   `E₀ = (6.01347706 u) * (0.931494 GeV/u)`\n*   `E₀ ≈ 5.6015 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe total relativistic energy `E` is related to the rest energy `E₀` by the Lorentz factor, `γ`, which depends on the velocity `v`.\n*   The velocity is given as `v = 0.96c`.\n*   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)`\n*   `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28`\n*   `γ ≈ 3.5714`\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nFinally, we calculate the total energy using the formula `E = γ * E₀`.\n*   `E = 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV`\n*   `E ≈ 20.0054 GeV`\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated energy is approximately 20.0054 GeV. We compare this result with the given options:\nA) 23.069 GeV\nB) 18.475 GeV\nC) 21.419 GeV\nD) 20.132 GeV\n\nOur calculated value of 20.0054 GeV is closest to option D, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (~0.6%) is likely due to the use of slightly different physical constants in the source of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>",
