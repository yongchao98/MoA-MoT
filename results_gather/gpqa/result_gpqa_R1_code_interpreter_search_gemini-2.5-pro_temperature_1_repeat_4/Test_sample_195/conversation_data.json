    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the conserved quantity: Total Energy**\n    In a conservative system, the total energy is conserved. For a relativistic particle subject to a potential, the total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n    The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the energy at two key points in the oscillation.**\n    The problem asks for the maximum speed, which occurs when the mass passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$). The oscillation is symmetric, and the mass is momentarily at rest at its maximum displacement (amplitude), $x = \\pm A$. We can use the conservation of energy by equating the total energy at these two points.\n\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum amplitude (maximum displacement)**\n        At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n        When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total, A} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position (maximum speed)**\n        At the equilibrium position, $x=0$, the potential energy is zero, and the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor at this speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total, 0} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy must be the same at both points:\n    $E_{total, 0} = E_{total, A}$\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    Divide the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n5.  **Solve for $v_{max}$ from the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    We have the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    We can rearrange this to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}}$\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    Rearrange the terms:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n6.  **Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ into the equation for $v_{max}$.**\n    Substitute the result from step 4 into the equation from step 5:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The derived expression matches option D.\n\n    A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$\n    B) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the non-relativistic limit)\n    C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$\n    D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
