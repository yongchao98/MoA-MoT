    "This is a common phrase used by organic chemists, and it almost always refers to a problem with purification, specifically by chromatography.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Context:** In a synthetic organic chemistry lab, a primary activity after running a reaction is purifying the desired product from a mixture that may contain unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and catalysts.\n2.  **Primary Purification Method:** The most common method for purifying compounds in this setting is chromatography, either Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) for analysis or Column Chromatography for purification on a larger scale.\n3.  **Principle of Chromatography:** Both TLC and column chromatography separate compounds based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This affinity is primarily determined by the compound's **polarity**.\n4.  **\"On top of each other\":**\n    *   On a **TLC plate**, compounds appear as spots after visualization. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel up the plate at the same rate, and their spots will overlap, appearing \"on top of each other.\" This indicates that a separation by column chromatography will be very difficult.\n    *   In **column chromatography**, the different compounds travel down the column as bands. If two compounds have similar polarities, their bands will move at nearly the same speed and will not separate. They will elute from the column at the same time, meaning the chemist cannot collect the pure product. The compounds are, again, effectively \"on top of each other\" in the elution profile.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n*   **A) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for separation by *distillation*, not chromatography. The jargon for this is usually different, such as \"they co-distill.\"\n*   **B) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is used for characterization, not typically for separation in a standard lab. Compounds with similar optical rotations can still have very different polarities and be easily separated.\n*   **C) Similar polarities:** This is the direct cause of poor separation in chromatography, the most common purification technique. This perfectly matches the expression \"on top of each other.\"\n*   **D) Bonding to each other:** While molecules interact via non-covalent forces, this isn't the specific technical reason for the purification failure. The failure is due to the *similarity* of their interactions with the chromatography medium, which is a function of their polarity.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is lamenting that their compounds (e.g., the desired product and an impurity) have very similar polarities, making them inseparable by standard chromatographic methods.\n\n<<<C>>>"
