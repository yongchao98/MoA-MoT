    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert through a chemical reaction, most commonly the migration of a proton. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). This hydrogen is called an α-hydrogen.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Let's examine its structure. It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. Each of these α-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (α-hydrogens). The presence of these acidic α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerization to form its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable, meaning cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily exhibits tautomerism.\n         \n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Let's examine its structure. It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4). The α-carbons (positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). They do not have the typical structure of an α-carbon (sp³ hybridized) from which a proton can be easily removed to form an enol. Therefore, benzoquinone does not have α-hydrogens in the conventional sense required for keto-enol tautomerism. It cannot tautomerize.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Let's draw its structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃. Let's analyze the carbon atom at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-C(=O)OCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OC(=O)CH=CH(C=O)OCH₃. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing all the atoms) and a center of inversion. Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does show geometric isomerism, as it is the *trans* isomer, and its *cis* counterpart is dimethyl maleate. But geometric isomerism is different from optical isomerism).\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
