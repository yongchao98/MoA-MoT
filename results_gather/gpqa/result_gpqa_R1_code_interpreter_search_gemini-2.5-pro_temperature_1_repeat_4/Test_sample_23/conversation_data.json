    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon that is the final product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, which can be either an alkane (general formula CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's test the general formulas using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, as is common in such problems.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2):\n        Mass % H = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2).\n        If we set this to 14.28% (which is approximately 1/7), we get:\n        (2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 1/7\n        7 * (2n + 2) = 1 * (14n + 2)\n        14n + 14 = 14n + 2\n        14 = 2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkane.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n):\n        Mass % H = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7.\n        1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.28%. This is a match.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, which has the formula C6H12. This fits the general formula CnH2n for n=6. We can confidently identify Z as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid in Y is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Let the other liquid in Y be D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane (no reaction).\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also give cyclohexane. This implies that D has the same six-carbon cyclic skeleton as cyclohexane.\n*   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot have any C=C double bonds in a ring or side chain. The only remaining possibility for a C6 cyclic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane and doesn't react with bromine water is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene only reacts with Br2 in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with aqueous bromine water.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B contain one or more C=C double bonds.\n*   Heating X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall reaction is:\n    A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   Since the products have a C6 ring, and hydrogenation of X also yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   The reaction is a transfer of hydrogen atoms. Let's look at the atom balance. The products are C6H12 and C6H6. The reactants A and B must collectively have C12H18 (12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms). Since A and B are both C6 compounds, their formulas must be C6Hx and C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\n*   A and B are unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Let's check if their hydrogen counts sum to 18: 10 + 8 = 18. This fits perfectly.\n*   So, the components of mixture X are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane (gains 2H), and cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene (loses 2H). This is a valid hydrogen transfer.\n*   The final condition is that \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n    *   Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (which has conjugated double bonds) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (which has isolated, non-conjugated double bonds).\n    *   To satisfy the condition, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   Mixture X consists of two liquids: cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
