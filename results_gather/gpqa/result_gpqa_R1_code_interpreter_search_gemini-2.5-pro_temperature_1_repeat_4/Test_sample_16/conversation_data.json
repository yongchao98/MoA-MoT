    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca^2+]) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex solution.\n\n1.  **Write the chemical reaction:**\n    The problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca(EDTA)]^2-. This complex will dissociate to a small extent into its constituent ions, Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    Dissociation: [Ca(EDTA)]^2-  <=>  Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant:**\n    The problem gives the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for the complex:\n    K_f = [ [Ca(EDTA)]^2- ] / ( [Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-] ) = 5 x 10^10\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10^10) = 2 x 10^-11\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\n    Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation.\n    *   **Reaction:**      [Ca(EDTA)]^2-  <=>  Ca^2+  +  EDTA^4-\n    *   **Initial (I):**      0.02 M             0 M        0 M\n    *   **Change (C):**        -x               +x         +x\n    *   **Equilibrium (E):**  (0.02 - x) M        x M        x M\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:**\n    K_d = ( [Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-] ) / [ [Ca(EDTA)]^2- ]\n    Substituting the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    2 x 10^-11 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10^-11 = x^2 / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:**\n    Because the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation constant (K_d) is very small. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    2 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n    Now, solve for x^2:\n    x^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-11) * 0.02\n    x^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n    Now, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = sqrt(4 x 10^-13)\n    x = sqrt(40 x 10^-14)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], is equal to x.\n    [Ca^2+] ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M.\n\n    The approximation is valid since 6.3 x 10^-7 is much smaller than 0.02.\n\n6.  **Use Python to confirm the calculation:**\n```python\nimport math\n\n# K_d = 2e-11\n# Initial concentration [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02\n# The equation is x^2 / 0.02 = 2e-11\nx_squared = 2e-11 * 0.02\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of Ca^2+ ions is 6.32x10^-7 M, which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical system and the question:** We have a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻, with an initial stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M. The question asks for the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺].\n\n2.  **Write down the relevant chemical reaction:** The system will reach equilibrium through the dissociation of the complex into its constituent ions. The reaction is:\n    [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Relate the given constant to the reaction:** We are given the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻  ⇌  [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n    K_f = [ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] ) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    The reaction we are analyzing is the dissociation, which is the reverse of the formation. Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** This table helps track the concentrations of all species as the system moves from the initial state to equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ formed at equilibrium.\n    *   **Reaction:**      [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺  +  EDTA⁴⁻\n    *   **Initial (I):**      0.02 M            0 M       0 M\n    *   **Change (C):**        -x              +x        +x\n    *   **Equilibrium (E):**  (0.02 - x) M       x M       x M\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:** Use the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table and the value of K_d.\n    K_d = ( [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] ) / [ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ]\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Simplify and solve for x:** The dissociation constant K_d is very small (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹), which indicates that the reaction barely proceeds to the right. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    The equation becomes:\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate x:** Rearrange the simplified equation to solve for x, which represents [Ca²⁺].\n    x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The calculation was confirmed using the python script, which gave an output of 6.32e-07.\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    A) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    D) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated value, 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
