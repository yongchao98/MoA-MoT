    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Products**\n\n*   **A**: A solid.\n*   **B**: A gas.\n*   **C**: A bright red product.\n*   **D**: A gas.\n*   **E**: An extremely hazardous product.\n*   **F**: A strong acid.\n*   **G**: A weak acid.\n*   **H**: A solvent.\n\n**2. Deduce the Identities of B, D, and H**\n\nThe reaction `D + B (1:1 ratio) -> H (solvent)` is a strong clue. This describes a simple addition reaction between two gases to form a liquid solvent. A very common and fitting example is the formation of phosgene:\n*   **CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(l)**\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) is a liquid at standard temperature (b.p. 8 °C) and is used as a solvent in some industrial applications.\n    *   This sets up two possibilities for B and D:\n        1.  B = Cl₂ and D = CO\n        2.  B = CO and D = Cl₂\n\n**3. Use the Hydrolysis Reaction to Identify A, B, C, F, and G**\n\nThe reaction `C + Water -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)` is the most chemically descriptive clue. The fact that solid A is reformed suggests a disproportionation reaction.\n\nLet's test **Case 1: B = Cl₂**.\n*   If B is Cl₂, then the strong acid F formed upon hydrolysis is very likely **hydrochloric acid (HCl)**.\n*   The reaction is `C + H₂O -> A(s) + HCl(strong) + G(weak)`.\n*   This means C is a chloride of some element (let's call it X, from A) that disproportionates in water. The element X must form a weak acid (G), which would be an oxoacid (HₓXOᵧ). This is characteristic of non-metals or metalloids in groups 15 and 16.\n*   Let's consider candidates for element A:\n    *   **Phosphorus (P)**: Hydrolysis of PCl₃ gives H₃PO₃ (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid), but it does not reform solid Phosphorus (P₄).\n    *   **Selenium (Se)**: Hydrolysis of diselenium dichloride (Se₂Cl₂) follows `2Se₂Cl₂ + 3H₂O -> 3Se(s) + H₂SeO₃(weak) + 4HCl(strong)`. This reaction fits perfectly, but requires a 3:4 ratio of Se to HCl.\n    *   **Sulfur (S)**: Hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) can be written as `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O -> S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4HCl(strong)`. The dissolved SO₂ forms sulfurous acid, H₂SO₃, which is a weak acid (G). This reaction fits the products: solid A (Sulfur), strong acid F (HCl), and weak acid G (H₂SO₃).\n\n**4. Check the Stoichiometry and Color for the Sulfur Hypothesis**\n\nNow let's verify the first reaction: `A(s) + 8 B(g) -> C (bright red product)` using the sulfur hypothesis.\n*   **A = Sulfur**. In its solid state, sulfur exists as crown-shaped S₈ rings.\n*   **B = Cl₂**.\n*   **C = SCl₂**. Sulfur dichloride is described as a cherry-red liquid. This matches \"bright red product\".\n*   Let's check the stoichiometry: **S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) -> 8SCl₂(l)**.\n    *   This reaction has a molar ratio of 1 mole of S₈ molecules to 8 moles of Cl₂ molecules. This perfectly matches the \"1 equivalent of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B\" clue.\n\n**5. Consolidate the Identities**\n\nAll clues are consistent with the following assignments:\n*   **A**: S₈ (Sulfur)\n*   **B**: Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   **C**: SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n*   **D**: CO (Carbon monoxide)\n*   **F**: HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   **G**: H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n*   **H**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\n**6. Identify Product E and its Symmetry**\n\nThe final step is to identify E from the reaction `C + 2D -> E`.\n*   **SCl₂(l) + 2CO(g) -> E**\n*   This reaction is known to produce thiophosgene (CSCl₂), although the stoichiometry in the problem (2 equivalents of CO) might be simplified. The most plausible product formed from these reactants is thiophosgene.\n    *   `SCl₂ + CO -> CSCl₂` (Thiophosgene)\n*   **E = CSCl₂** (Thiophosgene). Thiophosgene is an extremely hazardous lachrymatory liquid. This fits the description.\n*   Now, we determine the molecular geometry and point group of thiophosgene (CSCl₂).\n    *   The molecule has a central carbon atom, double-bonded to a sulfur atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    *   VSEPR theory predicts a trigonal planar arrangement around the carbon atom.\n    *   The molecule is planar. It possesses:\n        *   A C₂ rotation axis passing through the C=S bond.\n        *   A mirror plane containing all the atoms.\n        *   A second mirror plane perpendicular to the first, bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (thiophosgene) is C2v.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) C2v\nB) D4h\nC) D∞h\nD) C2\n\nOur deduced symmetry matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
