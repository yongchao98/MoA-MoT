    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties (like albedo). The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nThe problem states that all planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. It also specifies that they have the same albedo, $A$. Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis, $a$, are constant for the planets in this system.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period:**\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Combine the Relationships:**\n\nNow we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into our temperature proportionality:\n*   We know $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n*   And we know $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nTherefore:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P^{2/3}}}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{(2/3) \\cdot (1/2)}}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\nThis crucial result shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Temperatures:**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which is $\\frac{T_4}{T_2}$. Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{1/P_4^{1/3}}{1/P_2^{1/3}} = \\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_4^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**5. Use the Given Orbital Period Ratios:**\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods for Planet_1 through Planet_5 as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\nThis means:\n*   The period of Planet_2 ($P_2$) is proportional to 2.\n*   The period of Planet_4 ($P_4$) is proportional to 3.5.\n\nSo, the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_4}$ is:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\n**6. Compute the Final Value:**\n\nSubstitute this value back into our temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nTo get the numerical answer, we perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods P2/P4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The temperature ratio is the cube root of the period ratio\ntemperature_ratio = math.pow(period_ratio, 1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.8298711210665322\n```\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1-A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nWhere:\n- $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n- $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n- $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nThe problem states that all five exoplanets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant for all of them. It is also given that the planets have the same albedo, $A$. Therefore, the terms $T_{star}$, $(1-A)^{1/4}$, and $\\sqrt{R_{star}/2}$ are constant for all planets in this system.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which relates the orbital period ($P$) to the semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship for $a$ into our temperature proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P^{2/3}}} = \\frac{1}{(P^{2/3})^{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is $\\frac{T_4}{T_2}$. Using the proportionality we just derived:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{1/P_4^{1/3}}{1/P_2^{1/3}} = \\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_4^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can take the relative values for the periods of Planet_2 ($P_2$) and Planet_4 ($P_4$):\n- $P_2$ corresponds to the value 2.\n- $P_4$ corresponds to the value 3.5.\n\nSo, the ratio of their periods is:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\nNow we can calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3}$\n\nThe code output confirms the calculation:\n$(2/3.5)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nRounding this value to two decimal places gives 0.83. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
