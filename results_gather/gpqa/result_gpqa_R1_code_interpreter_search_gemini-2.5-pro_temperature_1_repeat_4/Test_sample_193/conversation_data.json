    "This problem requires us to calculate the partition function for a system of three spins. The partition function, Z, is a fundamental quantity in statistical mechanics that encodes the statistical properties of a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\n**1. Define the System and its States**\n\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 or -1.\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\n**2. The Energy of the System**\n\nThe energy for any given state is defined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\nwhere J is the coupling constant.\n\n**3. The Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors over all possible microstates:\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\n\nWe need to list all 8 possible microstates and calculate the energy for each one. We can group the states by the number of +1 and -1 spins.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    *   There are **2 states** with an energy of **E = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is different from the other two.**\n    *   Let's consider one spin is -1 and two are +1.\n        *   State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n        *   State (+1, -1, +1): E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n        *   State (-1, +1, +1): E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n    *   Let's consider one spin is +1 and two are -1.\n        *   State (+1, -1, -1): E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n        *   State (-1, +1, -1): E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n        *   State (-1, -1, +1): E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n    *   There are a total of **6 states** with an energy of **E = J**.\n\nTo verify this enumeration, we can use a simple python script.\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the possible spin values\nspins = [+1, -1]\n\n# Initialize a dictionary to store energy levels and their counts (degeneracies)\nenergy_counts = {}\n\n# We can set J=1 for the calculation and add it back symbolically later.\n# The energy will be in units of J.\n# E/J = -(s1*s2 + s1*s3 + s2*s3)\n\n# Generate all 8 possible configurations of the 3 spins\nfor s1, s2, s3 in itertools.product(spins, repeat=3):\n    # Calculate the energy for the configuration in units of J\n    energy_unit = -(s1*s2 + s1*s3 + s2*s3)\n    \n    # Count the occurrences of each energy level\n    energy_counts[energy_unit] = energy_counts.get(energy_unit, 0) + 1\n\n# Print the energy levels (in units of J) and their degeneracies\nprint(\"Energy Levels (E/J) and Their Degeneracies (g):\")\nfor energy, degeneracy in sorted(energy_counts.items()):\n    print(f\"E = {energy}*J, g = {degeneracy}\")\n\n```\n<execute_result>\nEnergy Levels (E/J) and Their Degeneracies (g):\nE = -3*J, g = 2\nE = 1*J, g = 6\n</execute_result>\nThe code output confirms our manual calculation:\n*   There are 2 states with energy E₁ = -3J.\n*   There are 6 states with energy E₂ = +J.\n\n**5. Construct the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over the distinct energy levels, weighted by their degeneracy (g):\nZ = Σ_levels g * e^(-βE)\n\nZ = (degeneracy of E₁) * e^(-β * E₁) + (degeneracy of E₂) * e^(-β * E₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z= 2e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nD) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3, each taking values +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\n**1. Understanding the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function (Z) in statistical mechanics is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible microstates of the system.\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\nSince multiple states can have the same energy, we can rewrite the sum over the distinct energy levels, multiplying each Boltzmann factor by the number of states (degeneracy, g) that have that energy:\nZ = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n\n**2. Identifying the Microstates and their Energies**\n\nThe system has three spins, each with two possible values (+1, -1). The total number of microstates is 2³ = 8. We need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states. We can group the states by their configuration.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State 1: (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n        E₁ = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   State 2: (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n        E₂ = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   So, we have **2 states** with an energy of **-3J**. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   This includes states like (+1, +1, -1) and (-1, -1, +1). Let's calculate the energy for one such state, (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = +J\n    *   By symmetry, all states with one spin different from the other two will have the same energy. Let's list them:\n        1.  (+1, +1, -1)\n        2.  (+1, -1, +1)\n        3.  (-1, +1, +1)\n        4.  (-1, -1, +1)\n        5.  (-1, +1, -1)\n        6.  (+1, -1, -1)\n    *   There are **6 states** with an energy of **+J**. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe provided Python code output confirms this analysis:\n*   Energy E = -3J has a degeneracy g = 2.\n*   Energy E = +J has a degeneracy g = 6.\n\n**3. Calculating the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow we sum the contributions from the two distinct energy levels:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nD) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
