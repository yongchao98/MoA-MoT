    "SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators. It is constructed based on a set of fundamental principles. Let's analyze each symmetry option:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory, which means it must be invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). SMEFT is built upon this same framework. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be Lorentz scalars to ensure the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry is a broader symmetry group that includes Lorentz transformations as well as spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Just like Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry is a fundamental assumption of any relativistic quantum field theory, including the SM and its effective extension, SMEFT.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model, specifically in the weak interactions described by the CKM matrix. SMEFT, being an extension of the SM, not only incorporates this SM source of CP violation but can also introduce new sources through higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, CP is *not* a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. In fact, searching for new sources of CP violation is a major goal of experiments that test SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a breakdown of the fundamental tenets of quantum field theory itself, which is a much more drastic scenario than what SMEFT describes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n- Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected.\n- CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry.\n- CPT symmetry (4) must be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT.\n\nThis corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
