    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and reactions.**\n    The solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates completely in water to give K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely in water to give 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and 2 H2O.\n    The primary species of interest are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which form a conjugate acid-base pair. This solution is a buffer.\n\n2.  **Determine the relevant equilibria.**\n    Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n    *   H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4- (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n    *   H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n    *   HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\n    Since the main components are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, the pH of the buffer is primarily controlled by the second equilibrium (Ka2).\n    The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third equilibrium (Ka3).\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L.\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = Mass of KH2PO4 / Molar mass of KH2PO4\n        Moles of H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O / Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O\n        Moles of HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = Moles of H2PO4- / V\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = Moles of HPO4^2- / V\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    Using the expression for the second dissociation constant, Ka2:\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n    [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    We can assume that the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their initial concentrations, as the dissociation is small.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\n    Using the expression for the third dissociation constant, Ka3:\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n    We use the [H+] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-].\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem statement\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # in g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # in g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # in Liters\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the initial molar concentrations\n# Moles of H2PO4- from KH2PO4\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\n# Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4*2H2O\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Concentration of H2PO4-\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n# Concentration of HPO4^2-\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\northophosphate_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The concentration of orthophosphate ions is: {orthophosphate_conc:.3e} M\")\n```\nThe calculation yields a result of 6.236 x 10^-7 M. This value, when rounded to three significant figures, is 6.24 x 10^-7 M. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M\nC) 2.81x10^-7 M\nD) 3.97x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Identify the components and their roles:**\n*   The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolved in water.\n*   KH2PO4 provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-), which acts as a weak acid.\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), which is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n*   Together, H2PO4- and HPO4^2- form a buffer solution. The pH of this buffer is determined by the equilibrium involving these two species.\n\n**2. List the relevant chemical equilibria for phosphoric acid (H3PO4):**\n*   H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4-       Ka1 = 7.5 x 10^-3\n*   H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-     Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8\n*   HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-       Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12\n\nThe primary buffer equilibrium is the second one, governed by Ka2, as the solution is made from H2PO4- and HPO4^2-. The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third equilibrium, governed by Ka3.\n\n**3. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n*   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n*   Moles of H2PO4- = Mass of KH2PO4 / Molar mass of KH2PO4\n    Moles H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O / Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O\n    Moles HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   Concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer:**\nWe use the expression for the second dissociation constant, Ka2, and assume the initial concentrations are approximately equal to the equilibrium concentrations.\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\nRearranging to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] ≈ 8.106 x 10^-8 M\n\n**5. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]:**\nWe use the expression for the third dissociation constant, Ka3.\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\nRearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.106 x 10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\n**6. Compare the result with the given options:**\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10^-7 M. Rounding to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
