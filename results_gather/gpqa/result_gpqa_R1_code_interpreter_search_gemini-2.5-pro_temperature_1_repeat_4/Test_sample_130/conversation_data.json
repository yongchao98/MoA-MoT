    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. This is the classic reaction of maleic acid to form maleic anhydride.\n    *   Maleic acid: *cis*-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH\n    *   Dehydration (-H₂O) → Maleic anhydride: A five-membered ring containing O-C(=O)-CH=CH-C(=O)-.\n*   **NMR Data of the Anhydride:**\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This corresponds to the two chemically equivalent vinylic protons (CH=CH), confirming the symmetry of maleic anhydride.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks. One for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) at ~165 ppm and one for the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) at ~137 ppm. This confirms the structure is maleic anhydride.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a substituted diene. The cyclopentadiene ring has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**2. Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Because the dienophile (maleic anhydride) can approach the plane of the diene from two different faces, two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   **The Endo Rule:** For Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically favored). The *exo* product is the minor product.\n*   **Structure of the Products:** The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride portion of the molecule is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C=C double bond bridge of the bicycloheptene system.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride portion is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C double bond bridge.\n\n**3. Analyze the Expected ¹H NMR Spectra of the Products**\n\n*   Both the *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C bond and the ether oxygen of the anhydride. This simplifies the NMR spectra.\n*   We can identify four main types of protons in the products:\n    1.  **Alpha-protons (Hα):** The two protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. Based on their chemical environment (alpha to a carbonyl, in a strained ring), a chemical shift around **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable.\n    2.  **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Methyl groups on a double bond typically resonate around **~1.7 ppm**.\n    3.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups attached to the bridgehead carbons (the carbons where the rings are fused). They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons and should be more shielded (at a lower ppm) than the vinylic methyls, likely around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    4.  **Bridge Methylene Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ group that forms the one-carbon bridge. These two protons are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic) and would typically give rise to two separate signals, each coupled to the other. The question mentions a \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\", which likely corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n**4. Use NOESY Data to Distinguish Between Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are bonded.\n*   The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons whose spatial proximity is significantly different in the *endo* vs. the *exo* isomer.\n*   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is folded *under* the C=C bridge. This brings the alpha-protons (Hα, ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) which are part of that C=C bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two groups.\n*   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring is folded *away* from the C=C bridge. The alpha-protons (Hα) and the vinylic methyl groups are now far apart. Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n\n**5. Match the Finding with the Given Options**\n\n*   The key differentiating NOE interaction connects the alpha-protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n*   Alpha-protons signal: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   Vinylic methyl protons signal: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the resonances at ~1.7 ppm and ~3.5 ppm.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This is an interaction between a bridge proton and the alpha-protons. This interaction likely exists in both isomers, although the specific protons involved might differ. It's not the clearest differentiating peak.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This is between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. They are too far apart for a significant NOE in either isomer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This corresponds to the interaction between the vinylic methyl protons and the alpha-protons. As determined above, this interaction is strong in the *endo* (major) product and weak/absent in the *exo* (minor) product. This is the correct answer.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This is between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. They are relatively close in both isomers, so an NOE would be expected in both.\n\n<<<C>>>"
