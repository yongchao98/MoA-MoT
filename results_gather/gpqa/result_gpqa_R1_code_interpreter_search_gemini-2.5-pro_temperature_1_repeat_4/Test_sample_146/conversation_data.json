    "*   **Initial State Analysis:**\n    *   The process is the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. For simplicity and to conserve momentum, we can assume we are in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. In this frame, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is the same as the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is:\n        $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n        $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n*   **Final State Analysis:**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   These particles and their antiparticles have the same mass, given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must be converted into the total final energy of the four A particles.\n    *   $E_f = E_i = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   By the principle of conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum is zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. To achieve this, the final particles must be created with some kinetic energy and move in opposite directions (in pairs or other symmetric configurations).\n    *   By symmetry, the available energy is distributed equally among the four resulting particles. The energy of each particle A is:\n        $E_A = \\frac{E_f}{4} = \\frac{1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n*   **Calculating the Velocity:**\n    *   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   We can now solve for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity $v$.\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Plugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\nWe can verify this with a short Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # MeV (Proton rest mass energy)\nm_a_c2 = 300     # MeV (Particle A rest mass energy)\n\n# 1. Calculate total initial energy (rest mass of p and p-bar)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# 2. Calculate the energy of a single final particle A (energy is shared equally)\nE_a = E_initial / 4\n\n# 3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for particle A\n# E_a = gamma * m_a_c2\ngamma = E_a / m_a_c2\n\n# 4. Calculate the velocity v in terms of c\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# (v/c)^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2\nbeta_squared = 1 - 1/(gamma**2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(beta_squared) # beta = v/c\n\nprint(f\"{beta=:.2f}c\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> beta=0.77c\n\nThe calculation confirms that the velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means we can neglect its kinetic energy. To conserve momentum (starting from a near-zero total momentum), we assume the reaction is viewed from the center-of-mass frame where the proton is also stationary.\n*   Therefore, the initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton ($p$) and the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The rest mass energy of a proton is a known physical constant, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n*   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Calculate the Final Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n\n*   The initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four resulting particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$).\n*   $E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum and the symmetry of the products, the energy will be distributed equally among the four final particles.\n*   The energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is:\n    $E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Relate Energy to Velocity**\n\n*   The total energy ($E_A$) of a relativistic particle is the sum of its rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) and its kinetic energy. The formula is:\n    $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   We can now find the Lorentz factor for particle A using its calculated total energy ($E_A = 469 \\text{ MeV}$) and its given rest mass energy ($m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$).\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.563$\n\n**5. Solve for Velocity (v)**\n\n*   Now we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity, $v$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n*   Rearranging the formula to solve for $v/c$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} \\approx \\sqrt{0.591}$\n*   $v/c \\approx 0.769$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
