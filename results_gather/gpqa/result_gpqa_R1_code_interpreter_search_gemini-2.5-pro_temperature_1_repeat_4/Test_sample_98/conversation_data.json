    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the options.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four proposed structures are saturated, so they are all consistent with this piece of information.\n*   **\"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: This is a very complex splitting pattern, which means the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d)** implies coupling to **1** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t)** implies coupling to **2** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Quartet (q)** implies coupling to **3** neighboring protons.\n    *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtq` signal must have neighbors: a `CH` group (1H), a `CH₂` group (2H), and a `CH₃` group (3H).\n*   **\"...a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This proton is also coupled to three different sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d)** implies coupling to **1** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t)** implies coupling to **2** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Another Triplet (t)** implies coupling to another, different `CH₂` group (2H).\n    *   Therefore, a proton showing a `dtt` signal must have neighbors: a `CH` group (1H), a `CH₂` group, and another non-equivalent `CH₂` group.\n\n**3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see if it can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(e)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is adjacent to H(c) (1H), a CH₃ group (3H), and a CH₂(e) group (2H). This would give a **dqt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dtt check:** To have a `dtt` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. This molecule only contains one CH₂ group (e). Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Option A is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH₂(d)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is adjacent to H(b) (1H), a CH₂(d) group (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). This would give a **dqt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dtt check:** This molecule only contains one CH₂ group (d). Therefore, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. Option D is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(c)(Et)-CH(b)(Et)-CH₂(d)CH₃(e)`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is adjacent to H(c) (1H), the CH₂ of its own ethyl substituent (2H), and the CH₂(d) of the backbone (2H). This would give a **dtt** signal. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **dqt check:** To have a `dqt` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group. Let's check the protons. None of the CH protons (b or c) are adjacent to a methyl group. The protons of the CH₂ groups (e.g., d) are adjacent to a CH (b) and a CH₃ (e), but not another CH₂ group. They are also adjacent to each other (geminal coupling, 1H). This would result in a `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets), not a `dqt`. Option C is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\nFirst, let's determine the correct structure from this condensed formula. The main chain is `C-C(Et)-C(Et)-C-COOH`. To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group. This is a 6-carbon chain, making it a hexanoic acid derivative.\nThe structure is `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\nLet's analyze the key protons in **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**:\n```\n          CH₃(g)   C₂H₅(e,f)\n          |        |\nHOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)----CH(c)----CH₂(d)-CH₃(h)\n```\n*   **Proton H(c):** This proton is on carbon 4. It is adjacent to:\n    *   H(b) on carbon 3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    *   CH₂(d) on carbon 5 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    *   CH₃(g) substituent (3H) → quartet (q)\n    The resulting signal for H(c) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dqt)**. This matches the first described signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton is on carbon 3. It is adjacent to:\n    *   H(c) on carbon 4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    *   CH₂(a) on carbon 2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    *   CH₂(e) of its ethyl substituent (2H) → triplet (t)\n    The resulting signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second described signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe structure of 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, which is represented by the condensed formula in option B, is the only one that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. It is a carboxylic acid, has no vinyl protons, and its structure predicts the presence of both a `dqt` and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
