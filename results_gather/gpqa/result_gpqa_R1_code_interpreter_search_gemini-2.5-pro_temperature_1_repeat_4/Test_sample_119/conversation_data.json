    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** This is the core assumption. It means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant everywhere in space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is given by:\n        `plx = 1/d`\n        This implies that the distance to a star can be expressed as:\n        `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Formulate the Goal:**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. In mathematical terms, if `N` is the number of stars, we need to find how the quantity `dN/d(plx)` depends on `plx`.\n\n3.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the Sun. The shell is at a distance `d` and has a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The surface area of a sphere with radius `d` is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Since the stars are uniformly distributed with density `ρ`, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the star density:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Translate from Distance to Parallax:**\n    Now, we need to express `dN` in terms of `plx` instead of `d`. We have two substitutions to make:\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Second, we need to relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to the corresponding interval in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the *number* of stars in a given range (which is always positive), we can consider the magnitude:\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n5.  **Combine the Expressions:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Analyze the Proportionality:**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax (`1/plx⁴`). This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
