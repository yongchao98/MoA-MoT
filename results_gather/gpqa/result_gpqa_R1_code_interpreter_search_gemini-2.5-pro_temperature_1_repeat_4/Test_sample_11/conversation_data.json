    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics Principles\n\nThe problem describes a particle decay. The fundamental principles governing this process are:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy of the system after the decay.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum of the system after the decay.\n\n### 2. Define the System and States\n\n*   **Reaction:** A positive pion (π⁺) decays into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν_μ). We'll denote the neutrino as ν.\n    π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   The pion (π⁺) is stationary (at rest).\n    *   Initial momentum (p_initial) = 0.\n    *   Initial kinetic energy (KE_initial) = 0.\n    *   Initial total energy (E_initial) = Rest mass energy of the pion = m_π * c².\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The system consists of a muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν), both moving.\n    *   Final momentum (p_final) = p_μ + p_ν.\n    *   Final total energy (E_final) = E_μ + E_ν.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    p_initial = p_final\n    0 = p_μ + p_ν\n    This implies that the momentum vectors of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: |p_μ| = |p_ν|. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    E_initial = E_final\n    m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n    Where E_μ and E_ν are the *total* relativistic energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.\n    *   E_μ = KE_μ + m_μ * c²\n    *   For the neutrino, its rest mass is extremely small and is considered to be zero for this type of problem (a standard approximation). For a massless particle, the total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, E_ν = KE_ν.\n\n    So, the energy conservation equation becomes:\n    m_π * c² = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + KE_ν   (Equation 1)\n\n### 4. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation\n\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\nE² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²\n\n*   **For the Muon (μ⁺):**\n    E_μ² = (p_μ * c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    Since |p_μ| = p, we have:\n    (KE_μ + m_μ * c²)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²   (Equation 2)\n\n*   **For the Neutrino (ν):**\n    Since we assume the neutrino is massless (m_ν = 0), its energy-momentum relation simplifies to:\n    E_ν = p_ν * c\n    Since |p_ν| = p and E_ν = KE_ν:\n    KE_ν = p * c   (Equation 3)\n\n### 5. Solve the System of Equations\n\nWe have a system of equations and need to solve for KE_μ and KE_ν.\n\n1.  From Equation 3, we can express (p*c) as KE_ν.\n2.  Substitute this into Equation 2:\n    (KE_μ + m_μ * c²)² = (KE_ν)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n3.  Expand the left side:\n    (KE_μ)² + 2 * KE_μ * (m_μ * c²) + (m_μ * c²)² = (KE_ν)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n4.  Cancel the (m_μ * c²)² term from both sides:\n    (KE_μ)² + 2 * KE_μ * (m_μ * c²) = (KE_ν)²   (Equation 4)\n5.  From the energy conservation (Equation 1), rearrange to find KE_ν:\n    KE_ν = m_π * c² - m_μ * c² - KE_μ\n6.  Substitute this expression for KE_ν into Equation 4:\n    (KE_μ)² + 2 * KE_μ * m_μ * c² = (m_π * c² - m_μ * c² - KE_μ)²\n7.  Let's simplify the notation by working in units of MeV. So, m_πc² becomes m_π, etc.\n    KE_μ² + 2 * KE_μ * m_μ = ((m_π - m_μ) - KE_μ)²\n8.  Expand the right side (using (a-b)² = a² - 2ab + b²):\n    KE_μ² + 2 * KE_μ * m_μ = (m_π - m_μ)² - 2 * (m_π - m_μ) * KE_μ + KE_μ²\n9.  Cancel the KE_μ² term from both sides:\n    2 * KE_μ * m_μ = (m_π - m_μ)² - 2 * (m_π - m_μ) * KE_μ\n10. Group the KE_μ terms together:\n    2 * KE_μ * m_μ + 2 * (m_π - m_μ) * KE_μ = (m_π - m_μ)²\n11. Factor out 2 * KE_μ:\n    2 * KE_μ * (m_μ + m_π - m_μ) = (m_π - m_μ)²\n    2 * KE_μ * m_π = (m_π - m_μ)²\n12. Isolate KE_μ to get the final formula:\n    KE_μ = (m_π - m_μ)² / (2 * m_π)\n\n### 6. Calculation\n\nNow, we plug in the given values to find the kinetic energies.\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n\nThe following Python code performs the calculation based on the derived formulas.\n```python\nm_pi = 139.6  # MeV/c^2\nm_mu = 105.7  # MeV/c^2\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon using the derived formula\n# KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 / (2 * m_pi)\nke_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)**2 / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino from energy conservation\n# KE_nu = m_pi - m_mu - KE_mu\nke_nu = m_pi - m_mu - ke_mu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of muon (μ+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of neutrino (ν): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> Kinetic Energy of muon (μ+): 4.12 MeV\n> Kinetic Energy of neutrino (ν): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energy for the muon is 4.12 MeV, and for the neutrino is 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV) match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν) is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Its initial total energy is its rest mass energy, E_initial = m_π * c².\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The products are a muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n*   By conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p).\n*   The final total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: E_final = E_μ + E_ν.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n    m_π * c² = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + E_ν\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    For any particle, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n    *   For the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   For the neutrino (assumed massless, m_ν ≈ 0): E_ν = pc. Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, so KE_ν = pc.\n\n**4. Deriving the Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\nBy combining the conservation laws and the energy-momentum relations, we can derive a formula for the kinetic energy of the heavier product particle (the muon):\n\nKE_μ = (m_π * c² - m_μ * c²)² / (2 * m_π * c²)\n\nLet's plug in the given values (working in units of MeV, where mc² is represented by m):\n*   m_π = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_μ = 105.7 MeV\n\nKE_μ = (139.6 - 105.7)² / (2 * 139.6)\nKE_μ = (33.9)² / (279.2)\nKE_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2\nKE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\n**5. Deriving the Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\nWe can find the neutrino's kinetic energy using the conservation of energy principle:\n\nKE_ν = E_initial - E_final_muon_rest_mass - KE_μ\nKE_ν = m_π - m_μ - KE_μ\nKE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 4.12 MeV\nKE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 4.12 MeV\nKE_ν ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
