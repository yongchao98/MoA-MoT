    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Absorption Data**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect and absorb acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   Mass increase = 0 g.\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information: no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or organic anions that would decompose to CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂).\n    *   The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass increase = mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these steps, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the Gaseous Products and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol of Gas C\n\nThe original salts are heated \"without air\". The products must come from the elements within the salts. The gases H₂O and O₂ are composed of H and O. What could Gas C be? Given that it passed through all the tubes without reacting, it must be a relatively inert gas. The most common inert gas produced from heating nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\nLet's assume Gas C is N₂ and check if the law of conservation of mass holds.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass exactly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) and their quantities is correct.\n\n**3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Mixture**\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles H = 2 × moles H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles N = 2 × moles N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles O = (1 × moles H₂O) + (2 × moles O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nSo, the original mixture contained only H, N, and O atoms. The problem states the mixture consists of two salts, A and B, in an equimolar ratio. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\nThe combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B, let's call it (A+B), must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O corresponding to the molar ratio we found:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can divide by the smallest number (0.05):\nN : H : O = (0.20/0.05) : (0.40/0.05) : (0.25/0.05) = 4 : 8 : 5.\nSo, the combined empirical formula for (A+B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n**4. Identify the Individual Salts A and B**\n\nWe need to partition the formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, the cation is almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺). If we have two salts, we likely have two ammonium cations.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions have the formula N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the total formula: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   This N₂O₅ must be the sum of the two anions in salts A and B. The most common and simple nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions) are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Let's check if they sum to N₂O₅: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ → N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions. At ~200°C:\n*   NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's find the number of moles (`n`).\nMolar mass of (A+B) = M(N₄H₈O₅) = 4(14) + 8(1) + 5(16) = 56 + 8 + 80 = 144 g/mol.\nTotal mass of mixture = `n` × M(A+B) = 7.20 g\n`n` = 7.20 g / 144 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\nSo we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's see if this produces the correct amount of gas:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio) → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.025 mol O₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   **Total products:**\n    *   N₂: 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches)\n    *   H₂O: 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Matches)\n    *   O₂: 0.025 mol (Matches)\nThe identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
