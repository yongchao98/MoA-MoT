    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the geometrical representation of a given density matrix, $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$, in the qubit's state space. This space is known as the Bloch sphere. A point in the Bloch sphere is defined by a real 3D vector, $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Bloch Sphere Representation:** Any single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix $I$ and the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$) using the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$:\n\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z)$\n\n    Our goal is to find the vector $\\vec{r}=(r_x, r_y, r_z)$ that corresponds to the given $\\rho$.\n\n3.  **Express the Given Density Matrix in Matrix Form:**\n    *   The standard basis vectors are:\n        $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The outer products are:\n        $|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, substitute these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   This is simply $\\frac{1}{2}I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n4.  **Compare the Two Forms of $\\rho$:**\n    *   We have our specific density matrix: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$.\n    *   We have the general Bloch sphere form: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z)$.\n    *   Setting them equal:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z)$\n    *   Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n        $I = I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n    *   Subtracting $I$ from both sides:\n        $0 = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n    *   The Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are linearly independent. This means the only way for their linear combination to be the zero matrix is if all the coefficients ($r_x, r_y, r_z$) are zero.\n    *   Therefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The Bloch vector is $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. This represents the center of the Bloch sphere. This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**, as it represents complete uncertainty about the qubit's state (an equal 50/50 probability of measuring 0 or 1 with no phase information).\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) r=(0,0,0) - This matches our result.\n    *   B) r=(1,1,1) - Incorrect.\n    *   C) r=(0,0,1) - This represents the pure state $|0\\rangle$.\n    *   D) r=(1,1,0) - Incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
