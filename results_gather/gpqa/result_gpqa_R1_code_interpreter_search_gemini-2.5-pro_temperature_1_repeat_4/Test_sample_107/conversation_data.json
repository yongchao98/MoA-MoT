    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to compare the two energy values.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Paramagnetic Coupling Term ($\\langle H \\rangle$)\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term, also known as the Zeeman energy shift, is given by the expectation value of the Zeeman Hamiltonian, $H_Z$:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = \\langle -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B} \\rangle $$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic dipole moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic dipole moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$$ \\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} $$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$$ H_Z = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} $$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = (0, 0, B)$. The dot product simplifies to:\n$$ \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B $$\nwhere $L_z$ is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum operator.\n\nThe Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$ H_Z = \\frac{e}{2m_e} L_z B $$\n\nThe expectation value of this Hamiltonian is the energy shift. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B $$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a fundamental physical constant known as the **Bohr magneton** ($\\mu_B$).\n$$ \\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T} $$\n\nTherefore, the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = \\mu_B m B $$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n*   $m$ has small values. Let's use $m=1$ as a representative small, non-zero integer value.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) $$\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} $$\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the energy of a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The relationship between energy and wavelength is:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is the Planck constant\n*   $c$ is the speed of light\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$\n\nThe product $hc$ is a useful constant in physics:\n$$ hc \\approx 1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm} $$\n\nFirst, convert the wavelength to nanometers:\n$$ \\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm} $$\n\nNow, calculate the transition energy:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.551 \\, \\text{eV} $$\n(Note: This wavelength, 486.1 nm, corresponds to the $n=4 \\to n=2$ transition in the Hydrogen atom's Balmer series).\n\n### 3. Comparison of Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the order of magnitude of the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Atomic transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\langle H \\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n$$ 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} \\ll 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $$\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$\n\nThis result is expected, as the Zeeman effect is a fine perturbation to the atomic energy levels, whereas the transition energy corresponds to the much larger energy difference between principal electronic shells.\n\n<<<A>>>"
