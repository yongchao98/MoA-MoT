    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (N) varies with parallax (plx) in a specific way. The number of stars per unit parallax, which can be written as the derivative dN/d(plx), is proportional to 1/plx⁵.\n    Mathematically, this is:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵  or  dN/d(plx) = k * plx⁻⁵ (where k is a constant of proportionality).\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance (r), specifically the number of stars per unit range of distance. This quantity is the derivative dN/dr. We are looking for the functional relationship between dN/dr and r.\n\n3.  **Relate Distance and Parallax:**\n    The parallax of a star is defined as the inverse of its distance. The standard formula is:\n    plx = 1/r\n    This also means r = 1/plx.\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    We want to find dN/dr, and we know dN/d(plx). We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule:\n    dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Missing Piece (d(plx)/dr):**\n    We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance. Using the relationship from step 3:\n    plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n    Taking the derivative with respect to r:\n    d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we can substitute the known parts into the chain rule equation from step 4.\n    *   From step 1: dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵\n    *   From step 5: d(plx)/dr = -1/r²\n\n    So,\n    dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)\n\n7.  **Express the Result in Terms of Distance (r):**\n    The current expression has both plx and r. To get the final relationship, we need to express everything in terms of r. We use the relationship plx = 1/r from step 3.\n    Substitute plx = 1/r into the expression:\n    dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ -r⁽⁵⁻²⁾\n    dN/dr ∝ -r³\n\n8.  **Final Interpretation:**\n    The result shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r³. The negative sign indicates that as one variable increases, the other formally decreases in the mathematical setup, but the question is about the functional dependence or the magnitude of the change. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance range varies as r³.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ r^5\nB) ~ r^2\nC) ~ r^3\nD) ~ r^4\n\nThe calculated relationship matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
