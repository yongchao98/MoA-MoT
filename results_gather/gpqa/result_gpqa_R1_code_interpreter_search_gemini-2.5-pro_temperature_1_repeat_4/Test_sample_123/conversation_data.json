    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and radioactive decay.\n\n**1. Understanding the Physics**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, that have not decayed after a time 't' in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ₀)\n    where N₀ is the initial number of particles and τ₀ is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** From our perspective in the lab (the detector's frame), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame, τ_lab, is longer than its proper lifetime τ₀ by a factor of γ (the Lorentz factor).\n    τ_lab = γ * τ₀\n\n*   **Relating the two:** The decay law can be expressed in terms of time measured in the lab frame (t_lab):\n    N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ₀))\n\n**2. Setting up the Equations**\n\n*   The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel to the inner wall. The distance they travel is the radius, R = 30 m.\n*   Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed 'v' is approximately the speed of light, 'c'.\n*   The time of flight in the lab frame is t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c.\n*   The fraction of particles reaching the detector wall is the fraction that survives this flight time:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))\n\nLet's group the constants together. Let K = R / (c * τ₀). The value of K is unknown, but it's a constant for this specific type of particle and detector setup.\nThe equation simplifies to:\nN/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)\n\n**3. Using the Initial Condition to find K**\n\nWe are given that when the Lorentz factor γ₁ = 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n\n*   γ₁ = 20\n*   N₁/N₀ = 1/3\n\nSubstitute these values into our simplified equation:\n1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n\nTo solve for K, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -K / 20\n-ln(3) = -K / 20\nK = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**4. Solving for the New Lorentz Factor**\n\nNow we want to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂, required for two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n\n*   N₂/N₀ = 2/3\n*   γ₂ = ?\n\nUse the same equation, but with the new values and the value of K we just found:\n2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nNow, solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)\nγ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula: gamma2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\ngamma2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\nThe result of this calculation is approximately 54.18.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 28\nC) 68\nD) 40\n\nThe calculated value of ~54.18 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics and Formulate the Equation**\n\nThe problem combines two key concepts from physics: radioactive decay and special relativity (specifically, time dilation).\n\n*   **Radioactive Decay:** The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a certain proper time `t_proper` is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t_proper / τ₀)`\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles, `N` is the number of surviving particles, and `τ₀` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** From our perspective in the laboratory (the detector's frame), the particle's internal clock appears to run slower. The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_proper` by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_proper`\n    Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle during its flight is `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n*   **Time of Flight:** The particles are created at the center and travel to the inner wall of the detector. The distance is the radius `R = 30 m`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. So, the time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n*   **Combining the Concepts:** We can substitute the expressions for `t_proper` and `t_lab` into the decay equation:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ₀) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    Let's group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` into a single constant `K`, since they don't change during the experiment: `K = R / (c * τ₀)`.\n    The simplified governing equation is:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**2. Use the Initial Condition to Find the Constant K**\n\nWe are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n\n*   `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n*   `γ₁ = 20`\n\nSubstitute these values into our equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**3. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nNow we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n\n*   `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n*   `γ₂ = ?`\n\nUse the same equation with the new values and the value of `K` we just found:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n`2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe previous Python calculation provided the numerical result for this expression:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 28\nC) 68\nD) 40\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 54.19 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
