    "This problem involves a two-step calculation: first, determining the pH at 25% of the way to the equivalence point in a titration, and second, finding the pH at the equivalence point itself.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume of the solution (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n\nWe use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration (M2).\n*   (0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M2 × (40.00 cm³)\n*   M2 = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Moles of Acetic Acid**\n\nNext, we calculate the initial number of moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.\n*   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol\n\n**Step 3: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻Na⁺ + H₂O\n*   At this point, we have 75% of the original CH₃COOH remaining and 25% has been converted to CH₃COO⁻.\n*   The ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to acid [HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n*   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, we find the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   Now, we calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n\nLet's compute the value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\n\n# --- pH at 25% titration ---\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n# --- pH at equivalence point ---\n# Initial moles of acetic acid\ninitial_moles_acid = 0.025 * 0.040 # M * L\n\n# At the equivalence point, all acid is converted to its conjugate base (acetate)\n# Moles of acetate = initial moles of acid = 0.001 mol\nmoles_acetate = initial_moles_acid\n\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point\n# M_naoh * V_naoh = moles_acid\nV_naoh = initial_moles_acid / 0.1 # L\n# V_naoh = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm3\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nV_total = 0.040 + V_naoh # L (initial acid solution + added NaOH solution)\n# V_total = 0.040 + 0.01 = 0.050 L\n\n# Concentration of acetate at equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acetate / V_total\n# conc_acetate = 0.001 / 0.050 = 0.02 M\n\n# Acetate is a weak base, it hydrolyzes in water: CH3COO- + H2O <=> CH3COOH + OH-\n# We need Kb for acetate\nKw = 1.0e-14\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n\n# Set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]\n# Let x = [OH-] = [CH3COOH] at equilibrium\n# Kb = x^2 / (conc_acetate - x). We assume x is small, so Kb ≈ x^2 / conc_acetate\nx_squared = Kb_acetate * conc_acetate\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared) # x = [OH-]\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(x)\npH_at_equivalence = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculations yield:\n*   **pH at 25% titration = 4.26**\n*   **pH at equivalence point = 8.52**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** ?\n\nWe use the dilution formula **M₁V₁ = M₂V₂**:\n(0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M₂ × (40.00 cm³)\nM₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\n**M₂ = 0.025 M**\n\nSo, the titration is performed on a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has reacted with the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted. This creates a buffer solution.\n\nThe reaction is: **CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O**\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\n**pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )**\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Given Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻] / [HA]:**\n    *   [A⁻] corresponds to the 25% that has reacted.\n    *   [HA] corresponds to the 75% that remains.\n    *   The ratio is 25 / 75 = 1/3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(0.333...)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻) in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol\n\n2.  **Determine the volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate:**\n    *   Total Volume = Initial volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH of the acetate solution:**\n    *   Acetate is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water: **CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb. We can find it from Ka using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then: 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we get:\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
