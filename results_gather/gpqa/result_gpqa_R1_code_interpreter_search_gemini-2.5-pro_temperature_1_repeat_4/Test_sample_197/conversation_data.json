    "The user wants to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], in a solution with a given total cobalt concentration and thiocyanate concentration.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\nIn the solution, the cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes:\n- [Co(SCN)]⁺\n- [Co(SCN)₂] (the one we are interested in, \"dithiocyanato\")\n- [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n- [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by overall stability constants (βn):\n- Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺,       β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n- Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂],     β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n- Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻,   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n- Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻,   β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Formulate the Calculation**\nThe fraction (αₙ) of any given complex [Co(SCN)ₙ]⁽²⁻ⁿ⁾ is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\nwhere β₀ is defined as 1.\n\nWe want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]. Therefore, we need to calculate α₂.\n\n**3. Identify Given Values**\n- Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n- Thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n- β₁ = 9\n- β₂ = 40\n- β₃ = 63\n- β₄ = 16\n\n**Assumption:** The concentration of the ligand, thiocyanate (0.1 M), is significantly larger than the concentration of the metal ion, cobalt (0.01 M). Therefore, we can assume that the concentration of free thiocyanate is approximately equal to its total concentration, i.e., [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration value is not needed to calculate the relative percentage of the species.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator of the α₂ fraction, which is common for all species fractions. Let's call it `D`.\nD = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator for α₂, which is β₂[SCN⁻]².\nNumerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value corresponds to option B.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, a Python script can be used.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# The denominator of the fraction formula (alpha_n)\n# D = 1 + beta1*[SCN] + beta2*[SCN]^2 + beta3*[SCN]^3 + beta4*[SCN]^4\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * SCN_conc**1 + beta2 * SCN_conc**2 + beta3 * SCN_conc**3 + beta4 * SCN_conc**4\n\n# The numerator for the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2], which corresponds to n=2\n# Numerator = beta2 * [SCN]^2\nnumerator_n2 = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex\nalpha2 = numerator_n2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_alpha2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage_alpha2=}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\npercentage_alpha2=16.91618032648228\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to understand the equilibrium reactions in the solution. The cobalt(II) ion (Co²⁺) reacts with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes:\n\n1.  Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\n2.  Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]\n3.  Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n4.  Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (βₙ):\nβ₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\nβ₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\nβ₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\nβ₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, c(Co), is the sum of the free ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe fraction (αₙ) of any specific complex [Co(SCN)ₙ] is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This fraction can be calculated using the following general formula:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are asked to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]. This corresponds to n=2.\n\nGiven:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nNote that the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M) is not needed to calculate the relative percentage of a species, as long as we can assume the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration. Since [SCN⁻] (0.1 M) is 10 times greater than c(Co) (0.01 M), this is a reasonable assumption.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator of the fraction formula:\nDenominator = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nDenominator = 2.3646\n\nNext, let's calculate the numerator for the α₂ fraction:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]²\nNumerator = 40 × (0.1)²\nNumerator = 40 × 0.01\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution, which yielded 16.916%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
