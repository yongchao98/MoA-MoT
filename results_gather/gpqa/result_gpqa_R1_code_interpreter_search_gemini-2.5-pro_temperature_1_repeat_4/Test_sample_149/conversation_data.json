    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) indicates it's adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). So, we have a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This corresponds to the CH₂ group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) is due to coupling with the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets with an integration of 2H, are classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have three fragments:\n    1.  A para-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄)\n    2.  An ethyl-aldehyde group (-CH₂CHO)\n    3.  An amino group (-NH₂)\n\n    Connecting these fragments gives the structure 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. The -NH₂ and -CH₂CHO groups are at positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. The chemical shifts support this: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons (making them appear at a lower ppm, 6.51 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -CH₂CHO group are less shielded (higher ppm, 6.98 ppm).\n\n    **Starting Material (A):** 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n     \n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: NaNO₂ + HCl, followed by H₂O.**\n    1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl (0-5 °C):** These are the reagents for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  **H₂O (often with gentle warming):** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water to replace the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂). This is a standard synthesis of phenols from anilines.\n\n    The product after these two steps is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde (B)**.\n     \n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n    *   The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat, and the substrate is an aldehyde (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde) with acidic α-protons (the protons on the carbon adjacent to the C=O group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic enolate ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. This forms an aldol addition product (an alkoxide).\n        3.  **Protonation:** The alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (C)**. This corresponds to option (B).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The condition \"Heat\" strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group at C-3 and the acidic proton at C-2 are removed, forming a double bond between C-2 and C-3. This dehydration step is called condensation. The product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is stabilized by conjugation between the new C=C double bond, the C=O group, and one of the phenyl rings.\n\n    **Final Product (D):** The final product is the result of this dehydration.\n    The structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n     \n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This name perfectly matches the structure of our derived final product from the aldol condensation.\n*   B) **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would dehydrate upon heating.\n*   C) **2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This molecule lacks the hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings.\n*   D) **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This molecule is not a dimer; it results from a different reaction pathway.\n\nGiven the reaction conditions, especially the application of heat, the condensation product is the expected final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
