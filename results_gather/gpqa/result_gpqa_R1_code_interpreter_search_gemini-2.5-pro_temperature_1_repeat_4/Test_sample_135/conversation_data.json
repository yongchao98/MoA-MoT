    "This problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field, `∇.f`, within a sphere of radius R.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude `|f(r)| = 1/r^2` and is directed radially. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. The Integral to Evaluate**\nWe need to compute the volume integral of the divergence of `f` over a sphere `V` of radius `R` centered at the origin:\n`Integral = ∫_V (∇ . f) dV`\n\n**3. Applying the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the flux of the field through the boundary surface `S` of the volume `V`:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . n_hat) dS`\n\n*   **Volume V**: A sphere of radius R.\n*   **Surface S**: The surface of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **Outward unit normal vector n_hat**: For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward normal vector at any point on the surface is simply the radial unit vector, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Surface Integral**\nLet's compute the dot product `f . n_hat` on the surface `S`:\nOn the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n`f = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n`n_hat = r_hat`\nTherefore, the dot product is:\n`f . n_hat = ((1/R^2) * r_hat) . r_hat = 1/R^2 * (r_hat . r_hat) = 1/R^2` (since `r_hat . r_hat = 1`)\n\nNow, substitute this into the surface integral:\n`∮_S (f . n_hat) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\nSince `R` is a constant radius, `1/R^2` is constant over the entire surface `S` and can be taken out of the integral:\n`Integral = (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\nThe integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\n`Integral = (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n`Integral = 4π`\n\n**Alternative Consideration: Direct Calculation of Divergence**\nIf we calculate the divergence of `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat` in spherical coordinates, we find that `∇ . f = 0` for all `r ≠ 0`. However, the field `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and the divergence at this point is undefined in the classical sense. The Divergence Theorem correctly handles this singularity by relating the integral to the flux through the enclosing surface. The non-zero result indicates that there is a \"source\" at the origin, and the divergence is actually a Dirac delta function: `∇ . (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ^3(r)`. Integrating this over a volume containing the origin gives `4π`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe value of the integral is `4π`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
