    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe formula for the relativistic relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `v1` is the velocity of the first astronaut = 0.6 c\n*   `v2` is the velocity of the second astronaut = 0.5 c\n*   `c` is the speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy (E) of a single particle is given by the formula:\n`E = γ * m0 * c^2`\n\nWhere:\n*   `m0` is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   `γ` (gamma, the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass = 2m, speed = 0.6c):**\n*   Calculate `γ1`:\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Calculate `E1`:\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass = 3m, speed = 0.5c):**\n*   Calculate `γ2`:\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Calculate `E2`:\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n**Calculate the total energy `E_total`:**\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2`\n`E_total = 5.964 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is `v_rel ≈ 0.14c` and the total energy is `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
