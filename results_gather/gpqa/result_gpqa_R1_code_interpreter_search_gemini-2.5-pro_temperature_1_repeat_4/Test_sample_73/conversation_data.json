    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a stochastic process that follows an exponential decay law. A key characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in the next minute, hour, or any other time interval.\n\n### **2. Formulating the Problem Mathematically**\n\nThe probability `P(t)` that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the formula:\nP_survival(t) = e^(-λt)\n\nwhere:\n*   `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a positive number that characterizes how quickly the substance decays.\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nThe probability that an atom *does* decay within a time `t` is therefore:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n### **3. Using the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP_decay(100) = 0.32\n\nUsing our formula:\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nThis equation relates the decay constant `λ` to the given information. We don't necessarily need to solve for `λ` itself, but we can use this relationship.\n\n### **4. Applying the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. Because the process is memoryless, this is equivalent to asking for the probability that a *new* atom of the same type would decay within 150 minutes.\n\nSo, we need to calculate:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n### **5. Calculating the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)`. We can use the information we found in Step 3:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nLet's manipulate the expression we want to find:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5)\n\nUsing the property of exponents `(a^b)^c = a^(b*c)`:\ne^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, we can substitute the value we know:\n(e^(-λ * 100))^1.5 = (0.68)^1.5\n\nSo, the probability of survival for 150 minutes is `0.68^1.5`.\n\nThe probability of decay within 150 minutes is:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n### **6. Computing the Numerical Value**\n\nTo get the final answer, we'll compute `1 - (0.68)^1.5` using a short Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the problem statement, the probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# P_survival(100) = 0.68\n# We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, this is equivalent to\n# finding the probability of decay for a new atom in a 150-minute interval.\n# P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150)\n\n# We know P_survival(t) = (P_survival(100))^(t/100)\n# So, P_survival(150) = (0.68)^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5\n\nprob_survival_150 = 0.68 ** 1.5\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survival_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"The probability of decay is: {prob_decay_150 * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe probability of decay is: 43.93%\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 43.93%.\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a problem about radioactive decay, which follows an exponential decay law. A key feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1.  **Define the probabilities:**\n    *   The probability of an atom *surviving* (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of an atom *decaying* within a time `t` is `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the given information to find a relationship for `λ`:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n    *   This means `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n        `P_survival(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability for the new time interval (150 minutes):**\n    *   We need to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, which is `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150)`.\n    *   `P_survival(150) = e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can relate this to the value we found in step 2 using the properties of exponents:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Now, substitute the value for `P_survival(100)`:\n        `P_survival(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n4.  **Compute the final value:**\n    *   First, calculate the probability of survival for 150 minutes:\n        `P_survival(150) ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   Now, calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes:\n        `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n5.  **Convert to a percentage:**\n    *   `0.4393 * 100% = 43.93%`\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
