    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers for this state:\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that the sum `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where T is the isospin. For the initial state, we have `L_i = 0` and `S_i = 0`, so `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This requires the isospin of the initial state to be `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, for the initial state `1S0`: `J_i = 0`, `P_i = +1`, `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: It has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. The problem does not specify the spin of X. A common particle emitted in such decays is a pion (π), which has spin `S_X = 0`. We will assume `S_X = 0`, which is standard for this type of problem unless specified otherwise. The orbital angular momentum of X is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`), which corresponds to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3` respectively.\n*   **Final NN state**: It has isospin `T_f = 0`. Its quantum numbers are given by the term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n\nWe must check three conservation laws and one statistical rule:\n\n**A. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle X's total angular momentum `J_X`. `vec{J}_{final} = vec{J}_f + vec{J}_X`.\n*   With `S_X = 0`, `vec{J}_X = vec{l}_X + vec{S}_X = vec{l}_X`, so `J_X = l_X`.\n*   For `vec{J}_{final}` to be zero, we must be able to couple `vec{J}_f` and `vec{l}_X` to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**B. Conservation of Parity:**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the final particles and the parity from their relative orbital motion: `P_{final} = P_{NN_f} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n*   `P_{NN_f} = (-1)^{L_f}` and `P_X = -1`.\n*   So, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n*   For this equation to hold, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**C. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\nThe problem explicitly states the condition from Pauli statistics: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n*   This, in turn, implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\nA transition is \"not permitted\" if it violates any of these three conditions.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each of the proposed final states against our three conditions.\n\n| Option | Reaction               | Final NN State (`L_f`, `S_f`, `J_f`) | X State (`l_X`) | **Pauli?** (`S_f+L_f` odd) | **Parity?** (`L_f+l_X` odd) | **Ang. Mom.?** (`J_f=l_X`) | Permitted? |\n|:------:|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------|:----------------|:-----------------------------|:----------------------------|:---------------------------|:----------:|\n|   A    | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`       | `L_f=0`, `S_f=1`, `J_f=1`            | `l_X=1`         | `1+0=1` (Odd) ✔️             | `0+1=1` (Odd) ✔️            | `1=1` ✔️                   | Yes        |\n|   B    | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`       | `L_f=2`, `S_f=3`, `J_f=1`            | `l_X=1`         | `3+2=5` (Odd) ✔️             | `2+1=3` (Odd) ✔️            | `1=1` ✔️                   | Yes        |\n|   C    | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`       | `L_f=1`, `S_f=1`, `J_f=0`            | `l_X=0`         | `1+1=2` (Even) ❌            | `1+0=1` (Odd) ✔️            | `0=0` ✔️                   | **No**     |\n|   D    | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`       | `L_f=2`, `S_f=1`, `J_f=3`            | `l_X=3`         | `1+2=3` (Odd) ✔️             | `2+3=5` (Odd) ✔️            | `3=3` ✔️                   | Yes        |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction in option **C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s** is not permitted. Although it satisfies the conservation of angular momentum and parity, it violates the Pauli principle for the final two-nucleon state. For the final state `3P0`, we have `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f + L_f = 2` (even). According to the Pauli principle for a `T_f=0` state, `S_f + L_f` must be odd. Therefore, a `3P0` state with `T=0` cannot exist for a two-nucleon system, and the transition is forbidden.\n\n<<<C>>>"
