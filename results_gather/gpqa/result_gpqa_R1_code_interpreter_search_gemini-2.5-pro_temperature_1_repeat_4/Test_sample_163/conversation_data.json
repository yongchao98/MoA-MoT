    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of binary system_1 (M1) to the total mass of binary system_2 (M2). The total mass is the sum of the masses of the two stars in the system.\n\n2.  **Extract Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principle:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2). The formula that connects these quantities is derived from Kepler's Third Law. The full expression is:\n\n    M = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\n    where:\n    *   M is the total mass of the system.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   i is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship:**\n    *   The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. Eclipsing binary systems are viewed nearly edge-on, which means their orbital inclination `i` is very close to 90 degrees. Therefore, sin(i) is approximately 1, and sin³(i) is also approximately 1.\n    *   Since we are looking for a ratio of masses (M1 / M2), the constant term (1 / (2 * π * G)) will cancel out.\n    *   This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n\n        M ∝ P * (K_total)³\n\n    where K_total = K1 + K2.\n\n5.  **Calculate Values for Each System:**\n    *   **For System 1:**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n        *   M1 is proportional to P1 * (K1_total)³ = 2 * (15)³\n\n    *   **For System 2:**\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n        *   M2 is proportional to P2 * (K2_total)³ = 1 * (25)³\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   The ratio M1 / M2 can be found by dividing the proportional values:\n\n        M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_total)³] / [P2 * (K2_total)³]\n        M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n        M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n        M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n        M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n        M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\n7.  **Final Computation:** To get the final decimal value, we perform the division. A simple python script can compute this accurately.\n\n```python\n# Parameters for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_total = 10.0 + 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_total = 15.0 + 10.0  # km/s\n\n# The total mass M is proportional to P * (K_total)^3\n# Calculate the ratio M1 / M2\n# The constants of proportionality cancel out.\nratio = (P1 * (K1_total)**3) / (P2 * (K2_total)**3)\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio M1 / M2 is 0.432. This value is approximately 0.4.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physical Principles:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P), the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K1 and K2), and the inclination of the orbit (i) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Use Simplifying Information:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" An eclipsing binary is one where the stars pass in front of each other from our point of view. This only happens when the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass formula significantly.\n\n4.  **Establish Proportionality:** With sin³(i) ≈ 1 and 2πG being a constant, we can establish a proportionality for the total mass:\n    M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\n5.  **Gather Data and Calculate for Each System:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Total radial velocity amplitude (K1_total) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n        *   Therefore, M1 ∝ 2 * (15)³\n\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Total radial velocity amplitude (K2_total) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n        *   Therefore, M2 ∝ 1 * (25)³\n\n6.  **Calculate the Mass Ratio:** Now we can find the ratio M1 / M2. The constants of proportionality will cancel out.\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_total)³] / [P2 * (K2_total)³]\n    M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The final step is to compute the decimal value of 54/125. This was done using the Python script in the previous step.\n\nThe result of the calculation `54 / 125` is 0.432.\n\nComparing this value to the options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated ratio of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
