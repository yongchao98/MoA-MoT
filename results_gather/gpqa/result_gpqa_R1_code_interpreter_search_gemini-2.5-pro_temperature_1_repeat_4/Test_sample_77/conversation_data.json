    "This problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the physical setup:**\n    *   A point charge `q` is moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n    *   We want to find the potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n    *   Because electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed `c`, the field at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define the Retarded Time ($t_r$):**\n    *   The retarded time is the time at which the signal (field) must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n    *   The distance the signal travels is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   The time it takes to travel this distance is $\\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the retarded time is defined by the implicit equation:\n        $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n3.  **Define the variables based on the problem statement:**\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r) = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t_r)}{dt_r}$.\n\n4.  **Rewrite the retarded time condition using the problem's notation:**\n    *   $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$ or $c(t - t_r) = d$.\n\n5.  **State the general formulas for Retarded Potentials:**\n    *   For a continuous charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)$, the retarded potentials are:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n        where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n6.  **Apply to a moving point charge (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):**\n    *   For a point charge, the integration becomes tricky because the volume element $d^3r'$ is evaluated at a fixed time `t`, but the charge density $\\rho$ must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. This leads to a correction factor in the denominator.\n    *   The standard results of this derivation (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) are:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)| - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r))\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)| - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r))\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n7.  **Substitute the problem's notation into the Liénard-Wiechert formulas:**\n    *   Substitute $\\vec{d}$ for $(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r))$, $d$ for $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)|$, and $\\vec{v}$ for the velocity at $t_r$.\n    *   Scalar Potential:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   Vector Potential:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n8.  **Manipulate the expressions to match the format of the options:**\n    *   The common denominator is $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})$.\n    *   We can rewrite this by finding a common denominator of `c`:\n        $d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}$\n    *   Now substitute this back into the expressions for V and A:\n    *   Scalar Potential:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n    *   Vector Potential:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   **A)** Has a `+` sign in the denominator. Incorrect.\n    *   **B)** Uses the static potential formula for V. Incorrect.\n    *   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   **D)** Uses the static potential formula for V. Incorrect.\n\nThe relationship $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$ is also satisfied by the derived potentials, since $\\frac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\mu_0\\epsilon_0\\vec{v} = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\vec{v}$. This confirms the consistency of the derived potentials.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are those given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
