    "Here is a thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring core.**\n*   **Substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3 or -OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of substituents.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects**\n\nLet's consider the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), which is the primary way to add groups to a benzene ring.\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **Amino (-NH2):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. (Intermediate, from reduction of -NO2).\n*   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. (Often used as a removable blocking group).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Final Steps**\n\nConsider how the final groups might be introduced.\n*   **The -OEt group:** It is most commonly introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis on a phenol (-OH group). This involves reacting the phenoxide (formed with a base like NaOH) with an ethyl halide (like EtBr). This suggests the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **The -NO2 group:** Could it be added last? If we nitrate 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene, both the -OEt (at C1) and -tBu (at C2) groups are ortho-, para-directors. They would direct an incoming electrophile (like NO2+) to positions 4 and 6. Position 3 is electronically and sterically disfavored. So, nitration is not the last step.\n*   **The -tBu group:** Could it be added last? If we perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, both the -OEt (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) groups direct the incoming t-butyl group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 is severely sterically hindered between the existing groups. The major products would be substitution at C4 or C6. So, alkylation is not the last step.\n\nThis analysis strongly supports that the final step is the Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr), and the key challenge is to synthesize the precursor: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**4. Devise a Synthesis for the Precursor (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol)**\n\nThe precursor has an OH, tBu, and NO2 group in a 1,2,3 arrangement. A direct synthesis is difficult. We need a strategy involving blocking groups and substituent transformations. Let's analyze the sequences given in the options.\n\n*   **Option C (i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...):** This sequence starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Options B and D (start with i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...):** These start by alkylating benzene to get tert-butylbenzene, then nitrating it. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Nitration will produce a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group hindering ortho attack. Since this step produces a significant mixture, it is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis of a single desired product. Therefore, Options B and D are unlikely to be correct.\n\n*   **Option A (i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...):** This sequence is the most promising.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.** Sulfonation. The bulky sulfonic acid group is directed to the para position, which is sterically most accessible. This step cleverly \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.** Nitration. The t-butyl group (o,p-director) can now only direct to the ortho position, as the para position is blocked. The sulfonic acid group (m-director) also directs to this same position. This gives a single, high-yield product. This initial sequence is the key to achieving the correct regiochemistry.\n\n**5. Analyze the Remainder of Option A**\n\nThe subsequent steps must transform `2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid` into `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` before the final etherification. Let's see if the remaining reagents can accomplish this, even if the written order is confusing. The required transformations are:\n1.  Remove the -SO3H group.\n2.  Transform the initial -NO2 group (at C2 relative to tBu) into an -OH group.\n3.  Introduce a new -NO2 group (at C3 relative to tBu).\n\nLet's try to logically order the remaining steps of A to achieve this:\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduces the existing nitro group.\n    `2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid`\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n    `→ 2-diazo-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid`\n*   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** This reagent, with heat, causes desulfonation.\n    `→ 2-diazo-tert-butylbenzene`\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** Now, we nitrate this intermediate. The t-butyl (at C1) and diazonium (at C2) groups are both o,p- and m-directing respectively, pointing to positions C4 and C6. We need substitution at C6. While C4 might be sterically favored, C6 substitution is plausible.\n    `→ 6-nitro-2-diazo-tert-butylbenzene`\n*   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This step hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.\n    `→ 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` (This is our required precursor!)\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis.\n    `→ 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` (The final product)\n\nThis logical reordering of the steps in Option A successfully produces the target molecule and uses every listed reagent. Although the sequence as written in Option A is not chemically sound, it provides the correct set of reagents and, most importantly, the only viable initial strategy for high-yield regiocontrol. In the context of a multiple-choice question, this makes it the best answer.\n\nFinal check:\n*   A: Correct initial steps for regiocontrol. Contains all necessary reagents for a plausible (if reordered) pathway.\n*   B, D: Poor regiocontrol in step ii. Not high-yield.\n*   C: Chemically impossible step iii.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
