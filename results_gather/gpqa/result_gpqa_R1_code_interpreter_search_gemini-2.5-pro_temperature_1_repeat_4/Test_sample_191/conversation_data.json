    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of electrostatics, specifically related to conductors and electrostatic shielding.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the conductor, it induces charges on the surfaces of the conductor.\n    *   To ensure the electric field inside the conducting material is zero (a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium), a total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This induced charge `-q` arranges itself on the inner surface to perfectly cancel the electric field produced by the `+q` charge for all points outside the cavity but within the conductor.\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means that the charges inside the conductor (the original `+q` in the cavity and the induced `-q` on the cavity wall) do not produce any electric field outside the conductor. The electric field outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge distribution on its outer surface.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly. This is because the outer surface is a perfect sphere, and it is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of the charge `+q` and the cavity inside. The charges on the outer surface will spread out as far as possible from each other, resulting in a uniform spherical distribution.\n\n4.  **Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A well-known result from Gauss's law is that the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell (or a solid sphere with a spherically symmetric charge distribution) is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a point charge at its center.\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center O.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field `E` at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at O. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other parameters given in the problem, such as the cavity radius `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance of P from the cavity's center `l`, and the angle `\\theta`, are all irrelevant for determining the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect. They are distractors.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
