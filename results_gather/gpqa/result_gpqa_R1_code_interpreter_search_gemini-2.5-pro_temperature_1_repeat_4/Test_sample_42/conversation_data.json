    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the written description into a chemical structure.\n\n*   **Core:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main Groups:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO, also named as the substituent \"formyl\"), and a cyano group (-CN). They are all *meta* (1,3-position) to one another. This implies a 1,3,5-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   **Assigning Initial Positions:** Let's place the highest priority group, the carboxylic acid (-COOH), at position C1. This makes the parent molecule a benzoic acid. The other two groups, -CHO and -CN, must be at C3 and C5 to satisfy the *meta-to-each-other* condition.\n*   **Placing Other Substituents:**\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2)\". The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3)\". The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n    *   **Crucial Constraint:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\". The nitrile (-CN) is at C5 (we could have placed it at C3, the result would be the same after renumbering).\n        *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. C4 is indeed ortho to C5. This is consistent.\n        *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the -OH group must be at **C6**.\n    *   **Finalizing the Structure:** Since the -OH group is at C6, the other group ortho to the carboxylic acid, the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2), must be at **C2**.\n\nThe final, unambiguous structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (Hydroxy)\n\n### 2. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, functional groups are prioritized. The order for the groups present is:\nCarboxylic Acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n### 3. Number the Benzene Ring\n\nWe must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n*   **C1** is fixed at the -COOH group.\n*   We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Path A (Clockwise):** C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CN, C6 is -OH. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Path B (Counter-clockwise):** C2 is -OH, C3 is -CN, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CHO, C6 is -N(CH3)2. The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince both numbering paths result in the same locant set, we must use a tie-breaker rule: the substituents are assigned the lowest possible locants based on their alphabetical order.\n*   The substituent names are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n*   We compare the two paths by looking at the locant assigned to the first substituent in the alphabetical list, which is \"cyano\".\n    *   In Path A (clockwise), \"cyano\" is at position 5.\n    *   In Path B (counter-clockwise), \"cyano\" is at position 3.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Path B (counter-clockwise) is the correct numbering scheme.**\n\nThe correct locants for the substituents are:\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **6-dimethylamino**\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nTo write the final name, list the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its correct locant, and then add the parent name.\n\n1.  **C**yano: **3-cyano**\n2.  **D**imethylamino: **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses used for clarity with complex substituents)\n3.  **F**ormyl: **5-formyl**\n4.  **H**ydroxy: **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **M**ethoxy: **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these alphabetically gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - This uses the incorrect (clockwise) numbering.\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This uses incorrect numbering and lists the substituents non-alphabetically.\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - This uses the correct numbering but lists the substituents non-alphabetically (by locant order).\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
