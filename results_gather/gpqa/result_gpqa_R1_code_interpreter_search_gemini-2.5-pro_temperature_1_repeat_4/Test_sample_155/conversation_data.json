    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   Structure: CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃ (propyl groups are *trans* to each other).\n\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   A useful stereochemistry rule is: a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face of the planar double bond with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from one face yields the (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the other face yields the (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers. Thus, this step produces a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide.\n\n*   **Step 1b: Epoxide opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).**\n    *   The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The overall reaction from alkene to diol is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   Another key stereochemistry rule is: a reaction pathway that involves an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (if the product structure allows for it). The mnemonic \"Trans-Anti-Meso\" (T.A.M) can be helpful here.\n    *   Let's verify this. We start with the racemic epoxide from the previous step.\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide: The incoming water molecule attacks one of the carbons from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (anti-attack). This inverts the stereocenter it attacks. For example, attack at C4 changes its configuration from R to S. The resulting diol is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide: Similarly, anti-attack by water leads to the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   Structure: CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃ (propyl groups are *cis* to each other).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   This is again a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: a *cis*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a *meso* compound (if the structure is symmetrical).\n    *   The (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry. The addition of oxygen from either the top or bottom face results in the same, single product: the *cis*-epoxide, which is meso-(4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Epoxide opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).**\n    *   This is an *anti*-addition, making the overall process an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: a reaction pathway that involves an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a racemic mixture. The mnemonic \"Cis-Anti-Racemic\" (C.A.R) applies.\n    *   Let's verify this. We start with the single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   The epoxide is protonated. Water can then attack either C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R): This inverts the configuration to S. The C5 configuration remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S): This inverts the configuration to R. The C4 configuration remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the attack is equally likely at both carbons, they are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   Compound 1 is a *meso* compound.\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are a pair of *enantiomers*.\n*   Compound 1 is a *diastereomer* of both Compound 2 and Compound 3.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral HPLC columns cannot distinguish between enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the enantiomeric pair (Compounds 2 and 3) will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like Compound 1 vs. the pair of 2 & 3) have different physical properties and will be separated by the column.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will interact differently with all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   The meso compound (1) will be separated from the chiral enantiomers (2 and 3).\n    *   The two enantiomers (2 and 3) will be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
