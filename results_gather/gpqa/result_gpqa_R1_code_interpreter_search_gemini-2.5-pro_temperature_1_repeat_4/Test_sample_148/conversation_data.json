    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with a combined integral of 1H, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this suggests the presence of two different species in the sample. The fact that the exchange between these two species is slow on the NMR timescale (otherwise, a single, broadened peak would be observed) points towards isomerism. The similar chemical shifts suggest the two environments are structurally similar. The roughly equal integrals imply that the two species are present in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The LC (Liquid Chromatography) separates compounds based on their physical properties (like polarity, size, etc.). The observation of two separate peaks confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species that can be separated by chromatography. The MS (Mass Spectrometry) data shows that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected product. This is a crucial piece of information: the two species are not a product and a precursor/impurity of a different mass; they are isomers of each other (same chemical formula, same mass). The equal intensities of the LC peaks corroborate the NMR data, suggesting a ~1:1 ratio of the two isomers. The mention of \"elevated temperature\" is a hint towards a dynamic process; for some isomers like conformers, raising the temperature can increase the rate of interconversion, which can affect the chromatography.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a procedural step in synthesis to improve yield. It would not result in two isomeric products.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they would not produce separate peaks in a standard NMR experiment (without a chiral reagent) or on a standard (achiral) LC column. This contradicts both the NMR and LC observations.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. This is contradicted by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass as the expected product.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is restricted rotation around the amide (C-N) bond. This creates cis and trans conformers (also known as rotamers or atropisomers), which are diastereomeric.\n        *   **NMR:** Because the chemical environments are different in the cis and trans forms, they give rise to separate sets of peaks in the NMR spectrum. The interconversion between them is often slow at room temperature, leading to two distinct peaks for the same proton.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different 3D shapes and polarities, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, resulting in two peaks. As isomers, they would have the identical mass spectrum.\n        *   This explanation perfectly fits all the observations: two NMR peaks for one proton, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass spectra for both species.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two species that are isomers (same mass) but are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by standard NMR is the hallmark of a mixture of diastereomers. In a peptide, this is most commonly due to cis/trans isomerism about an amide bond.\n\n<<<C>>>"
