    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence**\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1.**\n    *   This is the α-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with Br2, typically with an acid catalyst (which can be generated in situ), to replace one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   The two α-carbons (C2 and C6) of cyclohexanone are chemically equivalent. Therefore, the product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Product 1 = 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form product 2.**\n    *   This reaction involves an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH) and heat. The ketone has enolizable protons on the other α-carbon (C6). These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   The mechanism is as follows:\n        a.  The base (OH-) abstracts an acidic proton from C6, forming an enolate.\n        b.  The enolate attacks C2 in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclic intermediate, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-7-one.\n        c.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the strained carbonyl group of the bicyclic intermediate.\n        d.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, opening the cyclopropane ring to form the most stable carbanion. This leads to the formation of a five-membered ring.\n        e.  After protonation (during workup), the final product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   An alternative reaction could be E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the Favorskii rearrangement is a very common and expected pathway for α-halocyclohexanones. As we will see, the subsequent reactions and final options make the Favorskii pathway the only plausible one.\n    *   **Product 2 = Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n3.  **Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3.**\n    *   This is a standard textbook reaction. Thionyl chloride converts a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3 = Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n4.  **Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3) to form product 4.**\n    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for selectively reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 = Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4**\n\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.** Its structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n*   To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals expected in a proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum.\n\n*   Let's identify the different types of protons and their environments:\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (CHO):** There is one such proton. It is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n    2.  **The Methine Proton (C1-H):** This is the proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group. This proton is also in a unique environment. (1 distinct type)\n    3.  **The Methylene Protons (ring CH2 groups):** There are four CH2 groups in the cyclopentane ring at positions C2, C3, C4, and C5. Total of 8 methylene protons.\n\n*   **Symmetry and Stereochemistry Analysis:**\n    *   The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups (H, CHO, the C2-C3-C4-C5 part of the ring, and the C5-C4-C3-C2 part of the ring). Therefore, **C1 is a stereocenter**.\n    *   This means that cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a **chiral molecule**. The synthesis starts from an achiral precursor, so the product will be a racemic mixture (an equal mix of R and S enantiomers).\n    *   For NMR analysis in a standard achiral solvent, we can analyze a single enantiomer, as the spectrum of the racemate will be identical.\n    *   A chiral molecule, by definition, lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   In the absence of symmetry, protons are only chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a rapid process like bond rotation (e.g., the protons of a methyl group).\n    *   Let's analyze the methylene protons in one enantiomer (e.g., the R-enantiomer):\n        *   **Protons on C2:** The two protons on C2 are **diastereotopic**. They are not equivalent because of the presence of the nearby stereocenter at C1. They will give two different signals. (2 distinct types)\n        *   **Protons on C5:** Similarly, the two protons on C5 are diastereotopic. (2 distinct types)\n        *   **Protons on C3:** The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. (2 distinct types)\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic. (2 distinct types)\n        *   **Comparing different CH2 groups:** Since the molecule is chiral, the environment of C2 is different from C5 (they have a diastereotopic relationship). Likewise, the environment of C3 is different from C4. Therefore, the protons on C2 are not equivalent to the protons on C5, and the protons on C3 are not equivalent to the protons on C4.\n\n*   **Counting the total number of distinct hydrogens:**\n    *   Aldehyde H: 1\n    *   C1-H: 1\n    *   C2-H's: 2\n    *   C3-H's: 2\n    *   C4-H's: 2\n    *   C5-H's: 2\n    *   Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **10**\n\nThere are 10 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<B>>>"
