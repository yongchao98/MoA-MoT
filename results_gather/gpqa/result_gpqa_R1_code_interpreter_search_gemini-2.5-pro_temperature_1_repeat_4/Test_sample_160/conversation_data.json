    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n### **1. Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n\n`λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur. A larger cross-section means a higher probability of collision.\n\n### **2. Analyzing λ1 (Gas Molecule MFP)**\n\n*   **Moving Particle:** A gas molecule.\n*   **Target Particles:** Other gas molecules.\n*   **Interaction:** The interaction between two electrically neutral gas molecules is governed by short-range forces (like van der Waals forces). For a \"collision\" to happen, the molecules must get very close to each other.\n*   **Cross-Section (σ1):** The collision cross-section, let's call it `σ_gg` (gas-gas), is related to the physical, kinetic size of the molecules.\n*   **Formula for λ1:** `λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)`\n\n### **3. Analyzing λ2 (Electron MFP)**\n\n*   **Moving Particle:** An electron from the beam.\n*   **Target Particles:** Gas molecules.\n*   **Interaction:** The interaction is between a charged particle (the electron) and a gas molecule (which consists of a positive nucleus and a cloud of negative electrons). This is a long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) interaction. The incoming electron can be deflected (scattered) by the atom's electric field even from a considerable distance, without needing to physically \"hit\" it.\n*   **Cross-Section (σ2):** The collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule, let's call it `σ_eg` (electron-gas), is determined by this long-range Coulomb interaction.\n*   **Formula for λ2:** `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n\n### **4. Comparing the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\n*   The number density `n` of gas molecules is the same in both scenarios because the pressure and temperature inside the chamber have not changed.\n*   The crucial difference lies in the cross-sections. The effective area for a long-range Coulomb interaction (`σ_eg`) is much larger than the effective area for a short-range, kinetic-theory-based collision (`σ_gg`). An electron is far more likely to be scattered by a gas molecule's electric field than two gas molecules are to collide with each other.\n*   Therefore, we can conclude: `σ_eg > σ_gg`\n\n### **5. Concluding the Relationship between λ1 and λ2**\n\nSince the mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section `σ`, and we have established that `σ_eg > σ_gg`:\n\n*   A larger cross-section leads to a shorter mean free path.\n*   Because `σ_eg` is larger than `σ_gg`, the corresponding mean free path `λ2` must be smaller than `λ1`.\n\n`λ2 < λ1`\n\nThis means an electron traveling through the residual gas in the vacuum chamber will, on average, travel a shorter distance before being scattered than a gas molecule will travel before colliding with another gas molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>"
