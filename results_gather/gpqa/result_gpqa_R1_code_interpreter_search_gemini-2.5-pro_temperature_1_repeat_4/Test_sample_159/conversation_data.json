    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Shape:**\n    The problem describes an aperture in the shape of a regular N-sided polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. An apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n\n2.  **Consider the Limit as N becomes infinitely large:**\n    As the number of sides (N) of a regular polygon increases infinitely (N → ∞), while keeping the apothem 'a' constant, the polygon's shape approaches that of a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this resulting circle.\n\n3.  **Identify the Physics Problem:**\n    The problem is now simplified to finding the Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction pattern of a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This well-known phenomenon produces a diffraction pattern called an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n4.  **Locate the Intensity Minima:**\n    The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is given by:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n    where:\n    *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n    *   `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   `θ` is the angular distance from the central axis.\n\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur where the numerator, `J₁(k * a * sinθ)`, is equal to zero. The locations of these minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\n5.  **Use the Zeros of the Bessel Function:**\n    Let `u = k * a * sinθ`. The minima occur at the values of `u` that are the roots (zeros) of `J₁(u) = 0`. We need to find the first two non-zero roots. From mathematical tables or computational tools, the first two zeros of `J₁(u)` are approximately:\n    *   First zero, `u₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `u₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    The condition for the m-th minimum is `k * a * sin(θ_m) = u_m`.\n    Substituting `k = 2π/λ` and using the small angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`, we get:\n    `(2π/λ) * a * θ_m = u_m`\n    `θ_m = (u_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n    *   Angular position of the first minimum (`θ₁`):\n        `θ₁ = (u₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n    *   Angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`):\n        `θ₂ = (u₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n7.  **Find the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    The angular distance is the difference between the positions of the second and first minima:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n    `Δθ = [ (u₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ] - [ (u₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ]`\n    `Δθ = (u₂ - u₁) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Coefficient:**\n    To find the numerical coefficient, we calculate `3.1839 / (2π)`. We can use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# First zero of the Bessel function J1(x)\nu1 = 3.83170597\n# Second zero of the Bessel function J1(x)\nu2 = 7.01558667\n\n# The angular distance is delta_theta = (u2 - u1) / (2 * pi) * (lambda / a)\ncoefficient = (u2 - u1) / (2 * np.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately `0.5067`.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a (This is the angular position of the first minimum, not the distance between minima)\nD) 1.220 λ /a (This is related to the Rayleigh criterion for the diameter D=2a)\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will approach a circle of radius 'a' as N approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nFor a circular aperture, the intensity of the diffraction pattern at an angle θ from the central axis is given by the Airy pattern formula:\n\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n\nWhere:\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0`. The minima are located at the angles `θ` that satisfy this condition.\n\nLet `x = k * a * sinθ`. The minima correspond to the roots (zeros) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The first few non-zero roots of `J₁(x)` are approximately:\n*   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317` (for the first minimum)\n*   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156` (for the second minimum)\n\nUsing the small angle approximation, `sinθ ≈ θ`. So, the angular positions of the first two minima (`θ₁` and `θ₂`) are given by:\n\n`k * a * θ₁ = x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n`k * a * θ₂ = x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nSubstitute `k = 2π / λ`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ₁ ≈ 3.8317`  =>  `θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)`\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ₂ ≈ 7.0156`  =>  `θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`:\n\n`Δθ ≈ [ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ] - [ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ]`\n`Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) * (λ / (2π * a))`\n`Δθ ≈ 3.1839 * (λ / (2π * a))`\n\nNow we calculate the numerical coefficient `3.1839 / (2π)`:\n\n`Coefficient ≈ 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159) ≈ 0.5067`\n\nThe python code execution confirms this calculation with higher precision, giving `0.50673`.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance is approximately `0.506 * λ / a`.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
