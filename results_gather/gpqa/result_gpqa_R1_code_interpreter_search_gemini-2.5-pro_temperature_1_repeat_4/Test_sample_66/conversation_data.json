    "This problem involves the addition of angular momenta in quantum mechanics. We are given a system of two electrons, each in a p-orbital, and we need to determine the probability of a specific measurement outcome for their individual z-components of orbital angular momentum.\n\n### 1. Understand the initial state\n\n*   The system consists of two electrons in p-orbitals. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`. So, we have `l1 = 1` for the first electron and `l2 = 1` for the second.\n*   The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n*   In this state:\n    *   `l1 = 1`: Orbital angular momentum of electron 1.\n    *   `l2 = 1`: Orbital angular momentum of electron 2.\n    *   `l = 2`: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   `m = -1`: The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum (`Lz = L1z + L2z`).\n\nThis means the system is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator `L^2` with eigenvalue `l(l+1)ħ^2 = 2(2+1)ħ^2 = 6ħ^2`, and an eigenstate of the z-component of the total angular momentum `Lz` with eigenvalue `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\n### 2. Understand the measurement and the final state\n\n*   A joint measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L1z` and `L2z`, is performed.\n*   The eigenvalues of `L1z` and `L2z` are `m1ħ` and `m2ħ`, respectively.\n*   We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue `-ħ` for `L1z` AND the eigenvalue `-ħ` for `L2z`.\n*   This corresponds to the measurement outcome `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n*   The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state `|l1, m1; l2, m2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>`.\n\n### 3. Connect the initial and final states using the rules of quantum mechanics\n\nThere are two ways to solve this problem: a conceptual way based on conservation laws and a more formal way using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n#### Method 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum\n\nThe initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is an eigenstate of `Lz = L1z + L2z` with a definite eigenvalue of `mħ = -1ħ`. This means that any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum will *always* yield the value `-ħ`.\n\nThe measurement we are considering is of `L1z` and `L2z` individually. If the outcome of this measurement is `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`, the total z-component for this outcome would be:\n`m_final = m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\nThis would imply that the total z-component of angular momentum is `-2ħ`. However, we know the system started in a state where the total z-component was definitively `-1ħ`. A measurement cannot change the value of a conserved quantity if the system is already in an eigenstate of the corresponding operator. Since the z-component of total angular momentum must be conserved, it is impossible for a system with `m = -1` to be measured in a state with `m1 + m2 = -2`.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this outcome must be zero.\n\n#### Method 2: Using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients\n\nThe probability of measuring the system, which is in the initial coupled state `|l, m>`, to be in the final uncoupled state `|m1, m2>` is given by the square of the amplitude of the projection:\n\n`P(m1, m2) = |<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l1, l2, l, m>|^2`\n\nThe term `<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>` is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients provide the transformation between the coupled and uncoupled bases.\n\nA fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if `m = m1 + m2`.\n\nIn our case:\n*   Initial state: `|l, m> = |2, -1>`, so `m = -1`.\n*   Desired final state: `|m1, m2> = |-1, -1>`, so `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\nLet's check the selection rule:\n`m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince `m1 + m2 = -2` is not equal to `m = -1`, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n`<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0`\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n`P(-1, -1) = |0|^2 = 0`\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion. The joint probability of measuring both `L1z` and `L2z` to have eigenvalues of `-ħ` is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>"
