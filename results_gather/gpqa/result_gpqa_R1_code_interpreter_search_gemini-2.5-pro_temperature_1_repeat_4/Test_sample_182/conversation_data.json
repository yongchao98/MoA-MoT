    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Structure Breakdown:**\n    *   **Core:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n    *   **Main Functional Group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH). By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2.\n        *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5.\n\n*   **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** We can calculate this, but it's easier to first determine the IHD of the reactant from its structure.\n\n*   **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant:**\n    The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   One ring: IHD = 1\n    *   One C=C double bond in the ring: IHD = 1\n    *   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group: IHD = 1\n    *   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group: IHD = 1\n    *   One C=O double bond in the formyl (aldehyde) group: IHD = 1\n    *   **Total IHD of reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.**\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess of hydriodic acid (Red P + excess HI).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is a very powerful and exhaustive reduction reaction. It is known to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane structures.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The alkene double bond in the ring (C=C) is reduced to a single bond (C-C).\n    *   The alkene double bond in the vinyl group (C=C) is reduced to a single bond, converting the vinyl group to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\n*   **Structural Transformation:** The reaction removes all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) and all oxygen atoms. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the initial ring structure.\n*   **Product Structure:** The reactant's cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring. The substituents become alkyl groups. The product is a substituted cyclohexane, specifically 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane (the exact IUPAC name depends on numbering, but the connectivity and formula are fixed).\n*   **Key Feature of the Product:** The product is a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). It is fully saturated except for the presence of the single ring.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThere are two ways to find the IHD of the product:\n\n*   **Method 1: Based on Structural Features**\n    The product molecule contains:\n    *   One ring: IHD = 1\n    *   Zero pi bonds (C=C or C=O): IHD = 0\n    *   **Total IHD of product = 1.**\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on Molecular Formula**\n    *   The number of carbon atoms is conserved during the reaction. The reactant had 10 carbons, so the product has 10 carbons (C10).\n    *   The product is a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H(2*10) = C10H20.\n    *   Now, we use the IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. (Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, N is nitrogens. Halogens are treated like H, and Oxygen is ignored).\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0/2 + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   **IHD = 1.**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 3\nD) 5\n\nThe calculated IHD is 1, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
