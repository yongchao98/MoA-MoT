    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi, known as lithium dimethylcuprate or a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The nucleophile is the methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack\nThe primary rule for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by atoms C1, C6, and O7.\n*   Carbon C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group (`1,3,4-trimethyl...`).\n*   Carbon C6 is a secondary carbon (it is not directly substituted with one of the named methyl groups).\n*   Comparing C1 and C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n*   This immediately eliminates options B and C, which have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethyl` substitution pattern. This pattern would arise if the new methyl group added to C1, which is incorrect. The product must be a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` derivative (after re-numbering for the final product), which corresponds to options A and D.\n\n### 3. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThe ring-opening of an epoxide by a nucleophile is an **Sₙ2-type reaction**. This has a critical stereochemical consequence:\n*   The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom being attacked.\n*   The configuration of other chiral centers not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps is retained.\n\nLet's track the configuration of each chiral center from the reactant to the product.\n\n*   **Reactant Stereochemistry:** (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S)\n\n*   **Site of Attack:** C6.\n    *   The initial configuration at C6 is **S**.\n    *   Due to the Sₙ2 attack, the configuration at C6 will be **inverted** from S to **R**.\n\n*   **Other Stereocenters:**\n    *   **C1:** This carbon is part of the epoxide, but it is not the site of nucleophilic attack. The C1-O bond is not broken during the initial attack. It is protonated during the workup step to form the hydroxyl (-OH) group. Therefore, the configuration at C1 is **retained**. It starts as **R** and remains **R**.\n    *   **C3 and C4:** These carbons are on the cyclohexane ring and are not part of the reaction site. Their configurations are unaffected and are **retained**. They start as **R** and remain **R**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Product Structure and Name\nLet's assemble the final product, a substituted cyclohexanol, and determine its IUPAC name.\n\n*   The attack on C6 opens the epoxide ring, and after workup, we have an -OH group on C1 and a new methyl group on C6.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature for alcohols, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is assigned the lowest possible number, so it becomes the new C1.\n*   Let's map the old numbering to the new IUPAC numbering for the final product:\n    *   Old C1 (with -OH and a methyl group) -> **New C1**. Configuration retained: **R**.\n    *   Old C6 (attacked by Me⁻) -> **New C2**. Configuration inverted: S -> **R**.\n    *   Old C5 -> New C3\n    *   Old C4 (with a methyl group) -> **New C4**. Configuration retained: **R**.\n    *   Old C3 (with a methyl group) -> **New C5**. Configuration retained: **R**.\n    *   Old C2 -> New C6\n\n*   Combining these results, the stereochemistry of the product is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nComparing our derived product name with the given options:\n*   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2)\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect regiochemistry and stereochemistry)\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect regiochemistry)\n*   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (**Correct**)\n\nThe final product matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
