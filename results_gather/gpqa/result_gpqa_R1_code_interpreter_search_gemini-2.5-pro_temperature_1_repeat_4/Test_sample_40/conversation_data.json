    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference.\n    *   **S:** The laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   **S':** The rest frame of the glass, which is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **v:** The velocity of the glass (frame S') with respect to the lab (frame S). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam.\n    *   **u':** The velocity of the light beam with respect to the moving glass (frame S'). The index of refraction, `n`, relates the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, to its speed in the medium, `u'`. The relationship is `n = c / u'`.\n    *   Given that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **u:** The velocity of the light beam with respect to the observer in the laboratory (frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    *   According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, when adding velocities that are in the same direction, we use the following formula:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    *   This formula correctly combines the speed of light in the moving medium (`u'`) with the speed of the medium itself (`v`) to find the resultant speed as seen by a stationary observer (`u`).\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    *   We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the velocity addition formula:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   To simplify the complex fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and denominator, or more simply, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    *   `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    *   `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    *   `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
