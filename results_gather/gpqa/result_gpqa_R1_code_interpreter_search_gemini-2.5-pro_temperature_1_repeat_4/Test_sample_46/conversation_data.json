    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, calculate the degree of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring. The strong IR band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a C=O double bond, which accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine (R3N) would show none.\n    *   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This specific frequency is characteristic of an ester (typically 1715-1735 cm-1). It is too high for an amide (usually 1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic effects. One is electron-donating (shielding the ortho/meta protons), and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the ortho/meta protons).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water. This signal, combined with the IR data, confirms the primary amine (-NH2) group. Its chemical shift is appropriate for an aniline (aminobenzene) derivative.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The ester accounts for the C=O from the IR and the ethyl group from the NMR.\n    3.  The amine group (-NH2) is an electron-donating group. The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    4.  Placing these groups in a para- (1,4-) arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    5.  Let's verify this structure with the NMR shifts. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group should be upfield (shielded), which corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group should be downfield (deshielded), corresponding to the doublet at 8.0 ppm. This is consistent with the data.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This has a propionate group. The NMR would show a -C(=O)-CH2- quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two simple doublets. Also, the IR for an amide C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm-1).\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, so the IR would show only one N-H band, not two. It would also have a very downfield formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular Formula, DBE, IR, and 1H NMR).\n\n<<<D>>>"
