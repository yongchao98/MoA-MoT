    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is highly characteristic of the O-H group within a carboxylic acid (-COOH), due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (C=O stretch typically appears at 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the conclusion from the FTIR data that the molecule contains an alkene functional group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most plausible candidate, given the other evidence, is the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2 * 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragmentation strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectroscopic data, we have deduced that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: **A) C6H10O2** and **B) C6H12O2**.\n    *   To differentiate between these two, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n        (Note: Oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n    *   Our unknown compound has one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it must have a Degree of Unsaturation of **2**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation for the Remaining Options:**\nI will use a short Python script to calculate the DoU for the final two options.\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a given formula string like 'C6H10O2'.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    atoms = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n    \n    C = atoms.get('C', 0)\n    H = atoms.get('H', 0)\n    N = atoms.get('N', 0)\n    X = atoms.get('F', 0) + atoms.get('Cl', 0) + atoms.get('Br', 0) + atoms.get('I', 0)\n    \n    dou = C - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\nformula_A = \"C6H10O2\"\nformula_B = \"C6H12O2\"\n\ndou_A = calculate_dou(formula_A)\ndou_B = calculate_dou(formula_B)\n\nprint(f\"Degree of Unsaturation for {formula_A}: {dou_A}\")\nprint(f\"Degree of Unsaturation for {formula_B}: {dou_B}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nDegree of Unsaturation for C6H10O2: 2\nDegree of Unsaturation for C6H12O2: 1\n</execute_result>\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option B):** The calculated DoU is 1. This can account for the one C=O double bond of a carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), but it cannot also have a C=C double bond. Therefore, this formula is incorrect.\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option A):** The calculated DoU is 2. This perfectly matches our requirement for one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll the analytical data (FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec) consistently point to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with a molecular formula of C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "All the analytical data point to the same conclusion. Let's summarize the evidence:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is definitive evidence for a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH).\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene**, C=C).\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the **alkene** group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong confirmation of the **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n*   The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the formula must contain two oxygen atoms, eliminating options C (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n*   We must now decide between **A) C6H10O2** and **B) C6H12O2**.\n*   The molecule has one double bond from the carbonyl (C=O) in the carboxylic acid and a second double bond from the alkene (C=C). This means the molecule has a **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**.\n\nThe code calculated the DoU for the remaining options:\n*   **C6H10O2:** DoU = 2\n*   **C6H12O2:** DoU = 1\n\nThe molecular formula C6H10O2 has a Degree of Unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches the required two double bonds (one C=O and one C=C). The formula C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which could only account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, not the additional C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
