    "This problem requires us to determine the total energy of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well for its three lowest energy states.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n*   **Implication:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, each level can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2). So, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\nE_n = n^2 * E\n\nLet's list the first few energy levels:\n*   n = 1: E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n*   n = 2: E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n*   n = 3: E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n*   n = 4: E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nWe need to place the four fermions into these energy levels to find the total energy for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n**A. Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest possible energy levels first.\n*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is 2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level, `n=2`. Their combined energy is 2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**B. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)\n    E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**C. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\nLet's list the possibilities and their energies:\n*   **First Excited State (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility 1:** Promote one particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest empty level, `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
