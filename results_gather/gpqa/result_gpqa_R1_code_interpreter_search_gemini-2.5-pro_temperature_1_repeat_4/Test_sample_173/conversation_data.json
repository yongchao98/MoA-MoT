    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, let's call them fragment 1 (more massive) and fragment 2 (less massive).\n*   **Mass Relationship:** The rest mass of fragment 1 (`m1`) is twice the rest mass of fragment 2 (`m2`). So, `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. So, `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses and Rest Energies of the Fragments**\n\nFirst, we solve the system of equations for `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of fragment 1: `E1_rest = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of fragment 2: `E2_rest = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission must equal the total energy after. The energy released from the mass defect is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This total kinetic energy is called the Q-value.\n    `Q = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest`\n    `Q = (M * c^2) - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest (`p_initial = 0`). Therefore, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    `p1 + p2 = 0` (vector sum)\n    `|p1| = |p2|`\n\n**4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy (T1) using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`.\nSince the total energy is `E = T + E_rest`, we can write:\n`(T + E_rest)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`\nRearranging for `(p*c)^2`:\n`(p*c)^2 = (T + E_rest)^2 - (E_rest)^2 = T^2 + 2 * T * E_rest`\n\nSince `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`. Therefore:\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * E1_rest = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * E2_rest`\n\nWe have a system of two equations to solve for T1:\n1.  `T1 + T2 = 3` (in GeV) => `T2 = 3 - T1`\n2.  `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (99)`\n\nSubstitute `T2` from (1) into (2):\n`T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * 99`\n`T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396 * T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396 * T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396 * T1 + 204 * T1 = 603`\n`600 * T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nThis is the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**5. Calculate the Kinetic Energy (T1) using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal (`|p1| = |p2| = p`), we can write:\n`T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n`T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy released is the same Q-value of 3 GeV.\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\nThis is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment under the non-relativistic approximation.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the relativistic and classical values and convert it to MeV.\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nConvert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation.\n```python\n# Rest energies in GeV\nE1_rest = 198  # More massive fragment\nE2_rest = 99   # Less massive fragment\nQ_value = 3    # Total kinetic energy in GeV\n\n# Relativistic calculation\n# We solve the equation: 600 * T1 = 603\nT1_relativistic = 603 / 600  # in GeV\n\n# Classical calculation\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = Q_value\n# T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = E2_rest / E1_rest\n# T1_cl * (1 + m1/m2) = Q_value\n# T1_cl * (1 + E1_rest/E2_rest) = Q_value\n# T1_cl * (1 + 198/99) = 3\n# T1_cl * (1 + 2) = 3\n# 3 * T1_cl = 3\nT1_classical = 1.0  # in GeV\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy, `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`, and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\nWe are given the following relationships:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2` (one fragment is twice as massive as the other)\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M` (the sum of fragment rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass)\n\nFirst, let's find the rest masses of the fragments in terms of `M`.\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, let's calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1): `E1_rest = m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2): `E2_rest = m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = E_initial - E_final_rest = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared by the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nBy conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n`|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (E_rest) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`.\nSince total energy is `E = T + E_rest`, we can write `(p*c)^2 = (T + E_rest)^2 - (E_rest)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`.\n\nSince `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`. Therefore:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*E1_rest = T2^2 + 2*T2*E2_rest`\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `T1 + T2 = 3` => `T2 = 3 - T1` (all in GeV)\n2.  `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n\nSubstitute `T2` from (1) into (2):\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*99`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out.\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n**Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation of T1**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T_classical = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1=p2=p`), we have:\n`p^2 = 2 * T1_classical * m1`\n`p^2 = 2 * T2_classical * m2`\n\nTherefore, `2 * T1_classical * m1 = 2 * T2_classical * m2`, which gives the ratio:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`\n`T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `Q = 3 GeV`:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>"
