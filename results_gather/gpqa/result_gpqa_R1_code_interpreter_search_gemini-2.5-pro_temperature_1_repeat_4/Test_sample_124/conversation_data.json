    "This is a problem concerning the three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System and Energy Eigenvalues\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating variables in either Cartesian or spherical coordinates.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the potential is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The problem separates into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators. The total energy is the sum of the energies of these three oscillators:\n\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nwhere $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n### 2. Identifying the Energy States\n\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy state, which corresponds to the smallest value of $n$. The smallest value is $n=0$, which occurs when $n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0$.\n    *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next higher energy level, $n=1$.\n    *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Degeneracy\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. We need to find the degeneracy for the third excited state, which corresponds to $n=3$.\n\nWe need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n$n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$\n\nWe can list them out:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) -> 3 states\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) -> 6 states\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1) -> 1 state\n\nTotal number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator with principal quantum number $n$ can be calculated using the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10. This matches option B.\n\nThe energy expression in options A and C, $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, corresponds to the energy levels of a particle in a spherical box, not a harmonic oscillator potential.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Energy of third excited state ($n=3$): $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   Degeneracy of this state: 10.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 - Incorrect energy\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10 - Correct energy and degeneracy\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy\nD) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy\n\n<<<B>>>"
