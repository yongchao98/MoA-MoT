    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center is at C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure of (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one):\n        ```\n           O(1) - C(2)=O\n          /      \\\n        C(6)H2    C(3)H2\n        |         |\n        C(5)H2 -- C(4)H(Et)\n        ```\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This name indicates a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other is an isobutyl ester. The ethyl group is at the central carbon.\n    *   Structure of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid:\n        ```\n              Et\n              |\n        HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COOiBu\n         1     2    3    4      5\n        ```\n    *   The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe formation of a δ-lactone (6-membered ring) from this starting material implies that one of the carbonyl groups is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and then cyclization occurs.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagents LiBH₄ + H⁺**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The ester group at C5 (-COOiBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  --[LiBH4]--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1, forming a six-membered lactone (intramolecular esterification).\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagents BH₃ + H⁺**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  --[BH3]--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the ester at C1, forming the same six-membered lactone (intramolecular transesterification).\n\n**Conclusion from Pathways:** Both reaction pathways convert the starting material into the same product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. In both cases, the C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the spatial arrangement of the four groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of these groups, which might change due to the chemical transformation.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities for the Starting Acid (at C3):**\n    The four groups attached to C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n    1.  **-CH₂COOiBu** (Highest priority, P1): Comparing -CH₂COOiBu and -CH₂COOH, the ester group takes priority because the oxygen of the alkoxy group (-OiBu) is attached to a carbon, while the oxygen of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n    2.  **-CH₂COOH** (P2)\n    3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (P3)\n    4.  **-H** (Lowest priority, P4)\n    Priority Order (Acid): **-CH₂COOiBu > -CH₂COOH > -Et > -H**\n\n*   **CIP Priorities for the Product Lactone (at C4):**\n    The four groups attached to C4 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), and two fragments of the ring: -CH₂-C(=O)O- (let's call it A') and -CH₂-CH₂-O- (let's call it B').\n    *   Fragment A' is derived from the original -CH₂COOH group.\n    *   Fragment B' is derived from the original -CH₂COOiBu group.\n    1.  **-CH₂-C(=O)O- (A')** (Highest priority, P1): Comparing fragments A' and B', we look down their chains. In A', C4 is attached to C3, which is attached to C2. C2 is part of the C=O group and is bonded to two oxygens. In B', C4 is attached to C5, which is attached to C6. C6 is bonded to only one oxygen. Therefore, A' has higher priority.\n    2.  **-CH₂-CH₂-O- (B')** (P2)\n    3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (P3)\n    4.  **-H** (Lowest priority, P4)\n    Priority Order (Lactone): **-CH₂-C(=O)O- > -CH₂-CH₂-O- > -Et > -H**\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    Let's compare the priorities before and after the reaction:\n    *   The group that was **P1** in the acid (-CH₂COOiBu) becomes fragment B' in the lactone, which is **P2**.\n    *   The group that was **P2** in the acid (-CH₂COOH) becomes fragment A' in the lactone, which is **P1**.\n    The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap between any two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion of the stereochemical configuration** (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** A + LiBH₄ → **(R)**-lactone\n    Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** B + BH₃ → **(S)**-lactone\n    Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, the starting material B must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting Material A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
