    "The user wants me to find the energy spectrum for a particle in a given 2D potential.\n\n**1. Understand the Potential**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 * kr^2 + 3/2 * kr^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation, it is often best to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's try converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n**2. Coordinate Transformation**\n\nThe relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n*   x = r * cos(θ)\n*   y = r * sin(θ)\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\n*   The first term is `1/2 * kr^2 = 1/2 * k(x^2 + y^2)`.\n*   The second term involves `r * cos(θ)`, which is simply `x`. So, `kr^2 * cos^2(θ) = k * (r * cos(θ))^2 = kx^2`.\n\nNow, substitute these back into the potential V:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * (kx^2)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * kx^2 + 1/2 * ky^2 + 3/2 * kx^2\n\nGroup the terms by x and y:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 * k + 3/2 * k)x^2 + 1/2 * ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 * k)x^2 + 1/2 * ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 * ky^2\n\n**3. Identify the System**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 * ky^2\n\nThis is the potential for two independent (uncoupled) one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillators. One oscillator moves along the x-axis, and the other moves along the y-axis.\n\nThe total Hamiltonian of the system is separable:\nH = H_x + H_y\nTherefore, the total energy E is the sum of the energies of the individual oscillators:\nE = E_x + E_y\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential V(q) = 1/2 * k_eff * q^2 are given by:\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω\nwhere the angular frequency ω is `sqrt(k_eff / m)`.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We can write this in the standard form `1/2 * k_x * x^2`.\n    1/2 * k_x * x^2 = 2kx^2  =>  k_x = 4k\n    The angular frequency for the x-oscillator is:\n    ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k / m))\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 * ky^2.\n    The effective spring constant is k_y = k.\n    The angular frequency for the y-oscillator is:\n    ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**5. Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}:\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k / m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nFactor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m).\nLet's compare this with the given choices:\nA) E = (2n_x + 3n_y + 1/2) ħ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\nC) E = (n_x + 3*n_y + 3/2) ħ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (3n_x + 2n_y + 1/2) ħ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
