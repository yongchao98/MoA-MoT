    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n*   Substituents are at positions 1 (-COCH3), 3 (-Br), and 5 (-NO2).\n*   The three substituents are all in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating, ortho,para-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n**Evaluation of a Direct Synthesis Route:**\nA simple, direct synthesis might be:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The -COCH3 group directs the -NO2 group to the meta position.\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In 3-nitroacetophenone, both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) are meta-directors. They cooperatively direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to position 5.\n\nThis three-step synthesis is regiochemically correct. However, the final step (bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone) would be very slow and require harsh conditions because the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2). This would not be a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The provided options are all seven steps long, suggesting a more complex, indirect route is necessary to achieve a good yield. Such routes often involve using a temporary directing group that is later modified or removed. The presence of reagents for reduction of a nitro group (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) strongly points to the use of an amino group (-NH2) as a powerful ortho,para-directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this understanding.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These options start with the nitration of benzene, followed by reduction to form aniline. However, Option B proposes a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (iii), which is problematic as the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and making the reaction fail or give poor yields of the meta product. Option C proposes a sequence (i-iv) that converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene, which is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option D:** This option starts by making p-bromonitrobenzene (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of this product. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, and the nitro group is a very strong deactivator. Therefore, this step would fail, making Option D incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence appears to be the most chemically sound, employing the strategy of using a temporary directing group. Let's trace the steps carefully:\n\n    i) **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone**: Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n\n    ii) **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone**: The meta-directing acetyl group leads to bromination at the C3 position.\n\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**: This is a crucial step. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). The directing effects conflict. However, substitution is most likely at C4 (ortho to the o,p-director and meta to the m-director) and C6. Position 4 is generally favored. The product formed is 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone, which is the key intermediate for the next steps.\n\n    iv) **3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone**: The nitro group is selectively reduced to a primary amine.\n\n    v) **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**: Now, a second nitration is performed. The powerful activating and ortho,para-directing amino group at C4 dictates the position of the new substituent. It directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position, C5 (C3 is already occupied). The other groups on the ring (-COCH3 and -Br) are also consistent with substitution at C5. This step has excellent regioselectivity.\n\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt formation**: The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n\n    vii) **Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**: The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination reaction). This leaves the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups in the desired 1,3,5-relationship.\n\nThis sequence is a clever and synthetically valid route that uses an amino group (generated from an initial nitro group) as a temporary directing group to install the final nitro group at the correct position with high selectivity, before being removed. This pathway would lead to a high yield of the target product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
