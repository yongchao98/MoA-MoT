    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and present in a non-racemic form. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms bonded to the sp2 carbons (Cl, H, C, C) lie in the same plane. The molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the key information. The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of specific stereocenters with a defined absolute configuration. The `(E)` describes the geometry of the exocyclic double bond.\n    *   This designates a single, specific stereoisomer. A specific stereoisomer is always optically active unless it happens to be a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound must possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The structure is complex and unsymmetrical, particularly due to the `(E)-chloromethylene` group (`=CHCl`). This substituent breaks any potential symmetry that the parent bicyclic framework might have.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral and, as a specific stereoisomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are identical to the substituents on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   For a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the isomer with the (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is the meso form.\n    *   The meso form has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. Because it is superimposable on its mirror image, it is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It is the (R,R) diastereomer.\n    *   This isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are not superimposable.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair. As a single enantiomer is specified, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) -CH2-CH=CH- (path towards C2), and (4) -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6). The two paths around the ring are different due to the asymmetric position of the double bond relative to C1.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Thus, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the isomer where the three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. The most stable conformation would have all three bulky -OH groups in equatorial positions. However, even the less stable tri-axial conformation can be considered.\n    *   In the tri-axial conformation, the molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three vertical planes of symmetry (Ïƒv). Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group opposite to it.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Although the molecule has conformational isomers, the overall time-averaged molecule is achiral because the symmetric conformers are accessible.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters (a carbon with four different substituents).\n    *   The `CH(CH3)2` carbon is bonded to H, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule; it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   All other carbons are either sp2 hybridized (C=O) or are CH2 groups, so there are no stereocenters in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry in its most stable conformation (this plane contains the carbonyl group and bisects the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group).\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   **Inactive**: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Inactive**: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Inactive**: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   **Inactive**: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
