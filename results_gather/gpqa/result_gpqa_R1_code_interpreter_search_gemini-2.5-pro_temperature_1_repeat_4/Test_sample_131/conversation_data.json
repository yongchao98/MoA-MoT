    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe problem provides the following data for a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds with the formula C10H14:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets indicates a lack of adjacent, non-equivalent protons that would cause spin-spin splitting.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its chemical structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent to each other. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct sets of methyl groups. They will produce **two alkyl singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (ratio 1:1).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two aromatic singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. One might expect four separate alkyl singlets. However, due to very similar electronic environments (accidental equivalence), the spectrum typically shows **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The -CH2- group will be a quartet and the -CH3 group will be a triplet. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be eliminated** from consideration.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Described in Each Option**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Combined, this gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. Combined, this gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no overlap). This does not match the observed two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option does not match.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that correctly predicts the number and ratio of signals in both the aromatic and alkyl regions is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
