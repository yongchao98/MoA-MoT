As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of G2.**\n    *   The single-mutant `g2` results in a complete loss of resistance (0%). This is the most severe phenotype possible.\n    *   The double-mutant `g1g2` also has 0% resistance. The phenotype of the double mutant is identical to the `g2` single mutant. This is a classic example of **epistasis**, where the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation (which on its own only causes a drop to 75% resistance). Therefore, G2 is epistatic to G1.\n    *   Similarly, the double-mutant `g2g3` has 0% resistance, which is identical to the `g2` single mutant. This means G2 is also epistatic to G3.\n    *   In a genetic pathway, when one gene is epistatic to others, it typically means it acts upstream. The prompt states that at least one gene is a transcription factor. Since G2's knockout blocks the function of the pathway regardless of the status of G1 and G3, it is the most logical candidate for an upstream transcription factor that is required to activate both G1 and G3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between G1 and G3.**\n    *   The `g1` mutant has 75% resistance (a 25% loss from control).\n    *   The `g3` mutant has 50% resistance (a 50% loss from control).\n    *   If the genes acted in completely separate, additive pathways, we would expect the double mutant `g1g3` to have a resistance of 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n    *   However, the `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance. This phenotype is much more severe than the phenotype of either single mutant and also more severe than a simple additive effect. This type of genetic interaction, where the combination of two mutations produces a phenotype more severe than the sum of their individual effects, is known as a **synergistic interaction**.\n    *   Synergistic interactions often point to **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform similar or parallel functions. The loss of one can be partially compensated for by the other, but the loss of both is catastrophic to the function.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the provided options based on the analysis.**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: This aligns perfectly with our analysis of G2's epistasis over G1 and G3.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: This is a correct interpretation of the synergistic interaction observed in the `g1g3` double mutant.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This part is technically incorrect based on the classic definition of epistasis. For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` double mutant should have the same phenotype as the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). This is not the case (the double mutant has 10% resistance). However, the first two clauses are strongly supported by the data.\n\n    *   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. G2 is the clear candidate for the upstream transcription factor.\n        *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. We only have data for one trait (resistance), so we cannot make this conclusion.\n        *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This part is correct, but the rest of the option is wrong.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a possible molecular mechanism, but it cannot be concluded from this phenotypic data alone. They could have separate promoters that are both targeted by G2.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Cannot be concluded from the data.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Option A contains two statements (`G2 is a transcription factor` and `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`) that are the most accurate and strongest conclusions drawn from the experimental data. The other options contain statements that are either definitively incorrect or cannot be supported by the provided information. Despite the third clause in option A being technically inaccurate under a strict definition of epistasis, Option A is overwhelmingly the best choice as it correctly identifies the major roles and interactions of the genes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
