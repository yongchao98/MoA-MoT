    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of the impulse approximation is to treat a scattering event off a nucleus as a collection of scatterings off individual, quasi-free nucleons. Let's analyze each assumption:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the most fundamental tenet of the impulse approximation. It posits that the incoming probe (e.g., a photon, electron, or neutrino) interacts with a single nucleon at a time. This excludes more complex scenarios like meson-exchange currents (where the probe interacts with the particles mediating the nuclear force) or interactions with correlated nucleon pairs. Therefore, this assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption deals with what happens *after* the initial interaction. If the struck nucleon is ejected from the nucleus, or if other particles are produced, this assumption states that these outgoing particles do not interact with the remaining \"spectator\" nucleons on their way out. This is the \"plane wave impulse approximation\" (PWIA), which neglects Final State Interactions (FSI). Without this assumption, the behavior of the ejected nucleon would be significantly different from that of a free nucleon, as it would be influenced by the surrounding nuclear medium. Therefore, this assumption is essential for treating the nucleon as effectively free throughout the process.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. While models of the nucleon often involve quark dynamics, the impulse approximation is a statement about the behavior of the *nucleon as a composite particle* within the nuclear medium. The validity of the impulse approximation itself does not depend on whether the quarks inside the nucleon are treated relativistically or non-relativistically. One can apply the impulse approximation in both relativistic and non-relativistic frameworks for the nucleus. This assumption is therefore not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This assumption deals with the *initial state* of the nucleon before the interaction. In reality, a nucleon in a nucleus is bound by the strong force, which means it is not at rest (it has a momentum distribution) and its energy is shifted (it has a binding energy). This assumption states that for the brief duration of the high-energy interaction, these binding effects can be ignored. The nucleon is treated as if it were on its mass shell, like a free particle. This is crucial for simplifying the calculation and is a core part of the approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe impulse approximation rests on treating the interaction as a clean, one-on-one event with a single nucleon, ignoring both its initial binding to the nucleus and its final interactions with the residual nucleus. This corresponds to assumptions 1, 2, and 4.\n\n*   Assumption 1: Defines the interaction vertex (one-body current).\n*   Assumption 4: Defines the initial state (no binding).\n*   Assumption 2: Defines the final state (no re-interaction).\n\nAssumption 3 is related to the internal structure of the nucleon, not its behavior as a particle within the nucleus, which is the focus of the impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
