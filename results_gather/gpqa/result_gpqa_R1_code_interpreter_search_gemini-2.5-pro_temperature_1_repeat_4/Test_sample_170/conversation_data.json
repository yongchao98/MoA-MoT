    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either an ortho,para-director or a meta-director. This property determines the primary positions where the incoming bromine atom will attach.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They generally lead to a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating, o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all deactivating. The yield of the para-isomer from these substances will be very low.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the general order.**\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-isomer compared to ortho,para-directors, the substances with meta-directing groups will come first in the sequence (lowest yield), followed by the substances with ortho,para-directing groups.\n\nThe order will look like: {meta-directors} < {ortho,para-directors}.\nSo, {4, 2, 6} < {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6).**\nThe question asks for the order of *increasing* yield of the para-isomer. For meta-directors, the amount of para-product formed is minimal, but we can still rank them. The ranking depends on how strongly each group directs to the meta position. A stronger meta-director will result in a lower yield of any ortho or para products. The strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect for these groups is generally accepted as:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nThis means the -NO2 group is the most effective at directing to the meta position, and thus will produce the *least* amount of para-isomer. The -COOC2H5 group is the least effective meta-director among the three, so it will produce the *most* para-isomer (although still a very small amount).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2).\n\n**Step 4: Rank the substances with ortho,para-directing groups (1, 5, 3).**\nFor these substances, we need to consider the factors that influence the ratio of para to ortho product. The main factor is steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly. As a result, substitution at the less hindered para position is favored. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1).\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **Considering -Cl (3):** Halogens are a special case. Although they are deactivating, they are ortho,para-directors. The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the chlorine atom deactivates the entire ring, but it deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with some steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for substitution at the para position. The yield of the para-isomer for the bromination of chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest yield of the para-isomer in this group.\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the rankings into the final order.**\nNow we combine the rankings from Step 2, 3, and 4.\n\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\n\nThe final order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
