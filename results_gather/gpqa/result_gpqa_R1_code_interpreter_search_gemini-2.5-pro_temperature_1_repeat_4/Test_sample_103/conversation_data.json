    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which can be written as $P_2 / P_1$.\n\n### **2. Deconstruct the Provided Information**\n\n*   **System 1:** A star with mass $M_{s1}$ and a planet with mass $m_{p1}$.\n*   **System 2:** A star with mass $M_{s2}$ and a planet with mass $m_{p2}$.\n*   **Star Masses:** The stars have the same mass, so $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n*   **Planet Masses:** The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune\". In the context of the Radial Velocity (RV) method, the measured quantity is the *minimum mass*, which is $m_p \\sin(i)$, where $i$ is the orbital inclination. The most reasonable interpretation is that this measured quantity is the same for both planets. Therefore, we assume $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n*   **Orbits:** Both orbits are circular.\n*   **RV Data:** The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's light. The magnitude of this shift is proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight.\n    *   Periodic wavelength shift for star #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms.\n    *   Periodic wavelength shift for star #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms.\n\n### **3. Relate Observations to Physical Quantities**\n\nThe observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$). This means:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n### **4. Find the Relevant Physical Formula**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the host star's radial velocity ($K$) is given by the formula:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\nwhere:\n*   $P$ is the orbital period.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $m_p \\sin(i)$ is the minimum mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n\n### **5. Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems**\n\nWe want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's set up the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes, $K_1 / K_2$.\n\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}}$\n\n### **6. Simplify the Ratio**\n\nWe can cancel out the terms that are identical for both systems:\n*   The term $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$ is a constant and cancels out.\n*   The star masses are equal ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$), so $M_{s1}^{2/3}$ and $M_{s2}^{2/3}$ cancel out.\n*   The planet minimum masses are equal ($m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$), so these terms cancel out.\n\nAfter cancellation, the expression simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(1/P_1)^{1/3}}{(1/P_2)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n### **7. Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nNow we can substitute the known value of $K_1 / K_2$:\n\n$\\frac{5}{7} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nTo solve for $P_2 / P_1$, we need to cube both sides of the equation:\n\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n### **8. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nTo compare with the given options, we'll calculate the decimal value of the fraction.\n\n```python\nprint(125 / 343)\n```\n<execute_ipython>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_ipython>\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.364. This matches option A.\n\nA quick sanity check: Planet #2 causes a larger velocity shift in its star ($K_2 > K_1$). The formula $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ shows that a larger velocity amplitude corresponds to a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we expect $P_2$ to be shorter than $P_1$, and the ratio $P_2 / P_1$ should be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5 \\text{ miliangstroms}}{7 \\text{ miliangstroms}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the host star's radial velocity ($K$) is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight ($m_p \\sin(i)$ is the minimum mass).\n    *   $M_{\\text{star}}$ is the mass of the star.\n\n3.  **Set up a Ratio for the Two Systems**\n    We can write the equation for each system:\n    $K_1 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}$\n    $K_2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}$\n\n    Now, let's take the ratio $K_1 / K_2$:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio using the Given Information**\n    The problem provides the following key information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses. In the context of RV measurements, this implies their minimum masses are the same: $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n    *   $2\\pi G$ is a constant.\n\n    Canceling these identical terms from the numerator and denominator simplifies the equation significantly:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{P_1} \\cdot \\frac{P_2}{1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio ($P_2/P_1$)**\n    We now have a simple relationship between the velocity ratio and the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Substitute the known value of the velocity ratio from step 1:\n    $\\frac{5}{7} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, $P_2/P_1$, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**\n    Calculating the decimal value of the fraction:\n    $\\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Comparing this to the options:\n    A) ~ 0.36\n    B) ~ 1.96\n    C) ~ 0.85\n    D) ~ 1.40\n\n    The calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
