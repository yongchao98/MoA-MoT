    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time states that it is impossible to know both the exact energy of a quantum state and its exact lifetime simultaneously. The relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state (the uncertainty in time).\n    *   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Relate Uncertainty to \"Resolving\" Energy Levels:** The uncertainty in energy, ΔE, can be thought of as the \"natural linewidth\" or \"width\" of the energy level. An energy level is not a perfectly sharp line but has a small spread of energies. For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two levels will overlap and appear as a single, broader level.\n\n3.  **Identify the Limiting Factor:** We have two states with different lifetimes. The state with the *shorter* lifetime will have the *larger* energy uncertainty, making it the broader energy level. This broader level is the limiting factor for resolution.\n    *   State 1: Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   State 2: Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    Since Δt₁ < Δt₂, the energy uncertainty ΔE₁ will be greater than ΔE₂. Therefore, the minimum energy separation required is determined by the width of State 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty:** We can calculate the minimum energy width for each state. For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n    *   Value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    *   **Energy width for State 1:**\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **Energy width for State 2:**\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:** To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two energy widths.\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE₁\n    |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:** Now we check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Only option D provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is significantly greater than the natural linewidth of the broader state.\n\n### **Computational Verification**\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation.\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth, Gamma = h_bar / tau) for each state\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width for state 1 (lifetime {tau1} s): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width for state 2 (lifetime {tau2} s): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# To be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the\n# energy width of the broader line, which is state 1.\nprint(f\"\\nRequired energy difference must be > {delta_E1:.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-4\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > delta_E1:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is a valid energy difference for resolution.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a valid energy difference for resolution.\")\n```\n> Energy width for state 1 (lifetime 1e-09 s): 6.582e-07 eV\n> Energy width for state 2 (lifetime 1e-08 s): 6.582e-08 eV\n>\n> Required energy difference must be > 6.582e-07 eV.\n>\n> Comparing with options:\n> Option A (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT a valid energy difference for resolution.\n> Option B (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT a valid energy difference for resolution.\n> Option C (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT a valid energy difference for resolution.\n> Option D (1.0e-04 eV) is a valid energy difference for resolution.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem is solved using the energy-time formulation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state. This can be interpreted as the \"natural linewidth\" or \"width\" of the energy level.\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor two energy levels to be clearly resolved (distinguishable), the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the width of the energy levels. Since we have two levels, each with its own width, the energy difference must be greater than the *larger* of the two widths.\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy width for each state:**\n    The energy width (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Δt). Therefore, the state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, which is the limiting factor for resolution.\n\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / Δt₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / Δt₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n2.  **Determine the condition for resolution:**\n    The energy width of State 1 (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is larger than that of State 2 (ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV). Therefore, for the two levels to be clearly distinguishable, their energy difference must be greater than the width of State 1.\n\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n3.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    We need to find the option that is greater than ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV  (smaller)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV  (smaller)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (smaller)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV  (larger)\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference (10⁻⁴ eV) that is significantly larger than the required minimum separation (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\n<<<D>>>"
