    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct statement:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Problem:** The user describes a sophisticated chemical process: creating branched polyethylene using only ethylene as a starting material. This requires a dual-catalyst system.\n    *   **Catalyst 1 (Polymerization):** Takes ethylene and polymerizes it to form the main polymer chain (e.g., a Ziegler-Natta or metallocene catalyst).\n    *   **Catalyst 2 (Oligomerization):** Takes ethylene and converts it into short alpha-olefins (like 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene). These alpha-olefins are the \"branches\".\n    *   **The System:** Both catalysts must work together in the same reactor (*in situ*). Catalyst 2 makes the branches, and Catalyst 1 incorporates them into the main chain. This is known as tandem catalysis. The problem asks to identify the correct statement about this process.\n\n2.  **Analyze Statement A: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n    *   Noble metals (like palladium, rhodium) are known to catalyze ethylene oligomerization. However, they are extremely expensive and often sensitive to catalyst poisons. While technically possible in a lab, they are not the basis for the large-scale, industrial tandem catalysis systems developed for polyethylene production. The most successful systems are based on more common metals. Thus, this statement is misleading in the context of industrial implementation.\n\n3.  **Analyze Statement B: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n    *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene.\n    *   The catalysts used for both polymerization (metallocenes) and oligomerization (e.g., chromium-based systems) are very often activated by aluminum-based compounds. Methylaluminoxane (MAO) and other alkylaluminum compounds are standard co-catalysts/activators in this field. They are crucial for activating the catalyst.\n    *   Therefore, the statement that aluminum-based activators \"do not work\" is factually incorrect. They are often essential.\n\n4.  **Analyze Statement D: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n    *   The key breakthrough for industrial tandem catalysis was the development of catalysts that selectively trimerize ethylene to 1-hexene. These highly successful catalysts are based on the transition metal **Chromium (Cr)**.\n    *   The nomenclature \"Group VIa\" is archaic and ambiguous.\n        *   In the modern IUPAC system (Groups 1-18), Chromium is in **Group 6**.\n        *   In the older US-based CAS system, Chromium is in **Group VIB**. Group VIA contains the non-metals Oxygen, Sulfur, etc.\n        *   In the older European system, Chromium is in **Group VIA**.\n    *   Because of this ambiguity, the statement's validity depends on which convention is used. Under the common US (CAS) convention, this statement would be false as it would refer to the wrong group of elements. This ambiguity makes it a weak choice for a definitively correct answer.\n\n5.  **Analyze Statement C: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n    *   This is a statement of fact about the chemical industry. Research confirms this is true.\n    *   Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, a major US-based company, developed and commercialized a tandem catalysis process. Their technology, which uses a chromium-based catalyst for in-situ 1-hexene generation and a polymerization catalyst, was first commercialized at their Cedar Bayou plant in Texas, USA.\n    *   This statement is factually accurate and unambiguous.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Statement B is demonstrably false.\n    *   Statement A is misleading.\n    *   Statement D is, at best, ambiguous and potentially false depending on the nomenclature system used.\n    *   Statement C is a clear, verifiable, and unambiguous fact.\n    *   Therefore, Statement C is the most accurate and correct choice among the options provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
