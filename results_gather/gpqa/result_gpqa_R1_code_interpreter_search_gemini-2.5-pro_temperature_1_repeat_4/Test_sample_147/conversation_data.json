    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and substance A2**\n\nThe problem states that A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, so its formula can be written as YF_n.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\nWhere M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M_Y is the molar mass of element Y.\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for M_Y:\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\nM_Y = (n * 12.9276) / 0.3196\nM_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow we test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms, corresponding to an oxidation state of Y) to find a matching element Y.\n*   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, Ar - chemically unlikely)\n*   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Br - bromine does not form 5 binary fluorides)\n*   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (no stable element)\n*   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Hg, Tl - chemically less likely)\n*   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.70 g/mol (close to Pu, Am - let's keep this in mind)\n\nLet's check the fit for Antimony (Sb) precisely. If Y = Sb and n = 3, then A2 = SbF3.\nThe theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF3 is:\nɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis value is very close to the given 31.96% (a difference of only 0.25%). This provides strong evidence that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF3**.\n\nThe other properties (\"Five binary compounds\", \"A1 and A3 oxidize Xenon\") are characteristic of strong fluoride compounds, like those of antimony. SbF5 is a very strong Lewis acid and can oxidize Xenon. While only two simple binary fluorides (SbF3, SbF5) are common, mixed-valence compounds exist, which might be what \"five binary compounds\" refers to.\n\n**Step 2: Identify A1, A3, A4, and A5**\n\n*   **A1:** Decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and F2. This means A1 must have a higher fluorine content than SbF3. The next stable fluoride is SbF5. Thus, **A1 = SbF5**. The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" and decomposing at room temperature seems to be an inaccuracy in the problem statement, as pure SbF5 is a colorless liquid and more stable.\n*   **A3:** Obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and interacts with Xenon. Fluorination of Sb can yield SbF3 or SbF5. Since it interacts with Xenon, it must be the powerful oxidant and Lewis acid **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A4 and A5:** \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes a reaction where antimony metal is added to a solution of one of its fluorides (A4) to produce another fluoride (A5). This must be a reduction reaction. The only plausible reaction among the simple fluorides is the reduction of SbF5 by Sb metal to produce SbF3. This is a known comproportionation reaction:\n    2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3\n    In this reaction, the starting fluoride in solution is A4, and the product is A5.\n    Therefore, **A4 = SbF5** and **A5 = SbF3**.\n*   **Final Check:** \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" A5 is SbF3. Antimony trifluoride hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride and hydrofluoric acid (SbF3 + H2O → SbOF + 2HF), or antimony(III) oxide and hydrofluoric acid (2SbF3 + 3H2O → Sb2O3 + 6HF). In either case, two substances are formed. This is consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nThe question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls.\nFrom our analysis, A4 is Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF5).\nLet's calculate its molecular weight:\nM(A4) = M(SbF5) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\nM(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 5 * 19.00 g/mol\nM(A4) = 121.76 + 95.00\nM(A4) = 216.76 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the given options**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight for A4 is 216.76 g/mol. Let's look at the options:\nA) 220-240\nB) 110-130\nC) 160-180\nD) 140-160\n\nOur calculated value of 216.76 g/mol does not fall into any of these ranges. It is closest to range A, but is outside of it.\n\nLet's check the molecular weight of A5 (SbF3) for comparison:\nM(A5) = M(SbF3) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\nM(A5) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol\nM(A5) = 121.76 + 57.00\nM(A5) = 178.76 g/mol\n\nThis value, 178.76 g/mol, falls perfectly within range **C) 160-180**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere is a high probability that the question contains a typo and intended to ask for the molecular weight of substance A5, not A4. The entire logical chain of the problem consistently identifies all substances, and the molecular weight of A5 fits one of the options perfectly. The calculated molecular weight of A4 does not fit any option. Assuming this likely typo in the question, the correct substance to consider is A5 (SbF3), whose molecular weight is ~179 g/mol.\n\nHowever, if we must answer the question as written (for A4), there is no correct option. Given the choices, and the commonality of such errors in problem design, we select the answer that aligns with the most consistent logical path. This path points to A5 being the intended substance. If the question was for A5, the answer would be C. If the question is for A4, and we assume the ranges are simply inaccurate, A (220-240) is the closest choice for our calculated 216.76 g/mol. But the perfect fit for C is a much stronger indicator.\n\nLet's revisit the reaction to be certain. A4 is the reactant, A5 is the product.\nSb + A4(SbF5) -> A5(SbF3).\nQuestion asks for A4.\nIt appears the question is flawed. But if a choice has to be made, the most likely intended answer is C, based on the perfect numerical fit for A5, suggesting a typo in the question's target molecule. However, if we must assume A4 is asked, another possibility is that A4 is not SbF5, but another substance. Let's check the options. If A4's MW is in range C, A4 would be SbF3. The reaction would be Sb + SbF3 -> A5. This is not a chemically sound reaction to produce another binary fluoride. Therefore, A4 cannot be SbF3. This confirms that A4 must be SbF5.\n\nThe problem is fundamentally inconsistent as stated. But the evidence for a typo (asking for A4 instead of A5) is very strong. Based on this deduction, we identify the range for the intended molecule, A5.\n\nThe molecular weight of A5 (SbF3) is 178.76 g/mol, which is in the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal Answer seems to be C, assuming a typo in the question. Let's re-read again. What if A4 is the substance whose solution is colorless? Both SbF3 and SbF5 solutions are colorless.\nLet's assume the question is correct. Then A4 is SbF5, MW is 216.76. None of the options is correct. This is not how these problems usually work. It is almost certain that the question asks for A4 but the answer choices are for A5.\n\nI will provide the answer corresponding to the most likely intended question.\n\nFinal Answer should be based on A5 = SbF3, M=178.76.\nRange C is 160-180.\n\n```python\n# To confirm the molar mass calculation for the identified substances.\n# Element Y = Antimony (Sb), M = 121.76 g/mol\n# Fluorine (F), M = 19.00 g/mol\n\n# A4 was identified as SbF5\nmw_a4 = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00\n\n# A5 was identified as SbF3\nmw_a5 = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00\n\nprint(f\"Molecular weight of A4 (SbF5): {mw_a4}\")\nprint(f\"Molecular weight of A5 (SbF3): {mw_a5}\")\nprint(\"Option A: 220-240\")\nprint(\"Option B: 110-130\")\nprint(\"Option C: 160-180\")\nprint(\"Option D: 140-160\")\nprint(\"MW of A4 (216.76) is not in any range.

    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the unknown element Y and compound A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for A2 can be written as YF_n, where n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n × M_F) / (M_Y + n × M_F)\n    where M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol) and M_Y is the molar mass of element Y.\n\n    We can rearrange the formula to solve for M_Y:\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M_Y + n × 19.00)\n    0.3196 × M_Y + 0.3196 × n × 19.00 = n × 19.00\n    0.3196 × M_Y = n × 19.00 × (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 × M_Y = n × 12.9276\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    Now, we test integer values for 'n', which represents the oxidation state of Y, to find a plausible element.\n    *   If n = 1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but CaF is not stable).\n    *   If n = 2, M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine, but Br is a halogen itself).\n    *   If n = 3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This value is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   If n = 4, M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (no stable element matches well).\n\n    Let's verify the choice of Y = Sb and n = 3. This would mean A2 = SbF3.\n    The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF3 is:\n    ɷF = (3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 × 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is Antimony trifluoride (SbF3)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the remaining compounds.**\n    *   **A1 and A3**: A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine, so it must have a higher fluorine content. Both A1 and A3 oxidize xenon, which is characteristic of very strong Lewis acids and oxidants like Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). Fluorination of Sb (Y) also produces SbF5. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that **A1 = A3 = SbF5**.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: The problem describes a reaction where element Y (Sb) is added to a solution of A4 to produce A5. This is a classic comproportionation reaction where an element in its highest oxidation state is reduced by the pure element to an intermediate oxidation state. The reaction is:\n        2 Sb + 3 SbF5 → 5 SbF3\n    In this reaction, the substance in solution is A4, and the product is A5.\n    Therefore, **A4 = SbF5** and **A5 = SbF3**.\n    *   The final clue confirms this: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" A5 (SbF3) hydrolyzes in water to form antimony(III) oxide (Sb2O3) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), which are two distinct substances.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4 and compare with options.**\n    The question explicitly asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance **A4** falls.\n    We have identified A4 as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\n    Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(A4) = M(SbF5) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F)\n    M(A4) ≈ 121.76 + 5 × 19.00 = 121.76 + 95.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n    Now let's check the given options:\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges. It is close to range A, but is not within it.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate and conclude.**\n    There appears to be an inconsistency between the question and the options. Let's calculate the molecular weight of **A5 (SbF3)** as a check.\n    M(A5) = M(SbF3) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F)\n    M(A5) ≈ 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\n    This value, 178.76 g/mol, falls perfectly within range **C) 160-180**.\n\n    Given that all chemical clues consistently lead to the identification of the compounds, and the molecular weight of A5 is a perfect match for one of the options while the molecular weight of A4 is not, it is highly probable that the question contains a typographical error and was intended to ask for the molecular weight of substance A5. Based on this logical deduction, the correct answer corresponds to the range for A5.\n\n```python\n# Molar mass of Antimony (Sb)\nm_sb = 121.76\n# Molar mass of Fluorine (F)\nm_f = 19.00\n\n# Substance A4 is SbF5\nmw_a4 = m_sb + 5 * m_f\n\n# Substance A5 is SbF3\nmw_a5 = m_sb + 3 * m_f\n\nprint(f\"The calculated molecular weight of A4 (SbF5) is {mw_a4:.2f} g/mol.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated molecular weight of A5 (SbF3) is {mw_a5:.2f} g/mol.\")\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 220-240\")\nprint(\"B) 110-130\")\nprint(\"C) 160-180\")\nprint(\"D) 140-160\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe value for A4 ({mw_a4:.2f}) does not fit any range.\")\nprint(f\"The value for A5 ({mw_a5:.2f}) fits perfectly in range C (160-180).\")\nprint(\"\\nConclusion: The question likely has a typo and intended to ask for A5.

    "Based on the detailed step-by-step reasoning and calculations performed:\n\n1.  **Element Identification**: The element Y was identified as Antimony (Sb) based on the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2. A2 was identified as SbF3.\n2.  **Compound Identification**:\n    *   A4 was identified as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\n    *   A5 was identified as Antimony trifluoride (SbF3).\n3.  **Molecular Weight Calculation**:\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 (SbF5) is approximately 216.76 g/mol.\n    *   The molecular weight of A5 (SbF3) is approximately 178.76 g/mol.\n4.  **Conclusion**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4.
