    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles over energy states in a system at a certain temperature, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. Understand the Boltzmann Equation:**\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_i) is given by:\n\n(N_j / N_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_j, N_i are the populations of the energy levels j and i.\n*   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   E_j - E_i = ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe term (N_j / N_i) represents the \"excitation\" of the atoms to level j relative to level i.\n\n**2. Set up the equations for both stars:**\nLet's denote the excitation ratio for star_1 (at temperature T_1) as R_1 and for star_2 (at temperature T_2) as R_2. The energy levels and their statistical weights are the same for the iron atoms in both stars.\n\nFor star_1:\nR_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\nwhere C = (g_j / g_i) is a constant factor.\n\nFor star_2:\nR_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n**3. Use the information from the problem:**\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This translates to:\n\nR_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n**4. Substitute and solve:**\nNow, we substitute the expressions for R_1 and R_2 into this equation:\n\nC * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * ( C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] )\n\nThe constant C cancels out from both sides:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\nUsing the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x:\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nCombine the terms in the parenthesis using a common denominator (T_1 * T_2):\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n**5. Use the given numerical values:**\nThe problem provides:\n*   Energy difference, ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   The Boltzmann constant, k, is a fundamental constant with a value of k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nThe ratio (ΔE / k) is therefore:\n\n(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our derived equation:\n\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
