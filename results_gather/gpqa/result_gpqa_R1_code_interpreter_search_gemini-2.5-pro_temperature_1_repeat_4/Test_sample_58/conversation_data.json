    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The correct approach involves a step-by-step neutralization calculation.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles HCl = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates: Moles H+ = 0.08 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-), Moles OH- = 2 * 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles CH3COOH = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol.\n\n**2. Neutralize the strong acid and strong base.**\nThe strong acid (H+) and strong base (OH-) will react first in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Initial moles H+ = 0.08 mol\n*   Initial moles OH- = 0.18 mol\n*   Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, the H+ will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**3. Neutralize the remaining strong species with the weak species.**\nThe remaining strong base (OH-) will now react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of CH3COOH available = 0.05 mol\n*   The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Since there are more moles of OH- than CH3COOH, the weak acid will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n**4. Calculate the final concentration and pH.**\nThe final solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH- (a strong base). The presence of this strong base will dominate the pH of the solution.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M.\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) â‰ˆ 1.38.\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
