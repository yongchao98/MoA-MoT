    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical System and Method\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed near a grounded conducting sphere. A grounded conductor is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. To find the potential and forces, the most effective method is the **method of images**.\n\n### 2. Applying the Method of Images\nThe method of images states that the electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of V=0 at all points on the surface of the sphere (where r=R).\n\nThe standard results for this configuration are:\n*   **Image charge magnitude (q'):** The image charge is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`. Its magnitude is given by:\n    `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n*   **Image charge position (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center of the sphere is:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of the original charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: `q` at distance `d` and `q'` at distance `b` from the origin.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which, by the method of images, is simply the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n\n1.  The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere is the Coulomb force between `q` and its image `q'`.\n    *   Force `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n    *   At position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The force is attractive (negative sign).\n\n2.  The potential energy `U` is the work done against this force, which is the negative of the work done by the field.\n    `U = - W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n3.  To solve the integral, we use substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫ (1/2) * (1/u^2) du`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u]` evaluated from `x=∞` to `x=d`.\n    The limits for `u` are `∞` and `d^2 - R^2`.\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential `U = (1/2)qV`**\n\n1.  The energy of a system of conductors and charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\n2.  In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, so its potential `V_sphere = 0`. Thus, its contribution to the energy sum is zero.\n\n3.  The total energy is therefore just the energy of the point charge `q` in the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the potential `V_induced` is created by the charge `q` itself. We must not double-count the interaction energy.\n\n4.  The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere (`V_induced`) is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  Now, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result for the potential energy of the system.\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
