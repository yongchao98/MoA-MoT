    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position, with (S) configuration.\n    The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This means two diastereomeric products will be formed, generally in unequal amounts.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    The structure is: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C4). Because the reactant and reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Due to the symmetry of the molecule (the groups attached to C2 and C4 are identical), there are three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This compound is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Normal-Phase HPLC Chromatogram**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. In an achiral environment:\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties and cannot be separated (they co-elute).\n\nThe combined mixture contains five compounds in total: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers from Reaction II.\n1.  **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will have different retention times and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-diols). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers, however, will co-elute. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n3.  **Combined Mixture:** The products from Reaction I are methoxy-alcohols, while the products from Reaction II are diols. These two classes of compounds have significantly different structures and polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks on a normal-phase column will be the sum of the peaks from each group: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   The column creates a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n\nThe mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nSince all five of these compounds are stereochemically different from one another, a chiral column is expected to resolve all of them.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II will be separated from the others (as it's a diastereomer to them).\n*   The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be resolved from each other.\n\nAssuming no accidental co-elution, each of the five stereoisomers will produce a separate peak. This results in a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
