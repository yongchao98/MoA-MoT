    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from NaCN, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        `CH3-C(=O)-CH2CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin. Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n        `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., adding HCl or H₂SO₄ to water). It is a strong source of protons and is commonly used in an acidic workup step to protonate intermediates like the alkoxide formed here. This is a suitable choice for A.\n        *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite is a reagent that also adds to ketones, but it forms a bisulfite addition product, not a cyanohydrin. It is used for purification, not as a proton source in this context. Therefore, NaHSO₃ is not the correct reagent for A.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be **H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water, usually with heating. The reaction proceeds in two stages: first to an amide, and then the amide is further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n        `R-C≡N + 2 H₂O --(catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃ (or NH₄⁺ in acid)`\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B:**\n        *   **HCl:** Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. Strong acids are effective catalysts for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction mixture would be acidic, yielding the carboxylic acid directly.\n        *   **CH₃COOH:** Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it can theoretically catalyze the reaction, the hydrolysis of nitriles requires harsh conditions (strong acid or strong base). A weak acid like acetic acid is generally not effective enough to drive the reaction to completion in a reasonable timeframe.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The most suitable catalyst for this transformation is a strong acid, **HCl**.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n    *   Comparing this with the given choices:\n        A) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\n        B) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\n        C) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\n        D) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\n    *   The correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
