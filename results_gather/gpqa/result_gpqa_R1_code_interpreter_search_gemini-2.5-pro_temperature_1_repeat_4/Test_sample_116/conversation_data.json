    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. In biphenyl systems, if the four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky substituents, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered due to steric strain.\n    *   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'. This steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar. The molecule is forced into a stable, twisted conformation. This molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, it is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of stereoisomerism is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Analysis:** To check for chirality, we look for asymmetric carbon atoms (chiral centers). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group):\n        *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n        *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n        Since all four groups attached to carbon-2 are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and therefore it shows optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized, bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl rings), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, there is a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (the midpoint of the C=C double bond). The presence of any element of symmetry like a plane or center of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does show geometric isomerism with its *cis*-isomer, dimethyl maleate).\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
