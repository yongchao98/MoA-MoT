    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators:**\n    The components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ are given in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    This is the spin angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The problem asks for the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by a single angle $\\theta$ (the polar angle with respect to the z-axis). The azimuthal angle $\\phi$ is 0.\n    The Cartesian components of the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ are:\n    $n_x = \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi = \\sin\\theta \\cos(0) = \\sin\\theta$\n    $n_y = \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = \\sin\\theta \\sin(0) = 0$\n    $n_z = \\cos\\theta$\n    So, the direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n    Substituting the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)\\sin\\theta + (1)\\cos\\theta & (1)\\sin\\theta + (0)\\cos\\theta \\\\ (1)\\sin\\theta + (0)\\cos\\theta & (0)\\sin\\theta + (-1)\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $\\chi = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n \\chi = \\lambda \\chi$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components:**\n    This matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n    (i) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (ii) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    From equation (i), we can express $b$ in terms of $a$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $b = a \\left( \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta} \\right)$\n\n    Using the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b$:\n    $b = a \\left( \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\right) = a \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\right) = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, the eigenvector has the form $\\chi = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose $a=1$ for simplicity, giving an unnormalized eigenvector $\\chi_{un} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    A physical state vector must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) is 1. The normalization condition is $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n    Let the normalized eigenvector be $\\chi_{norm} = N \\chi_{un}$, where $N$ is the normalization constant.\n    The squared norm is $1^2 + (\\tan(\\theta/2))^2 = 1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2) = \\sec^2(\\theta/2)$.\n    The norm is $\\sqrt{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = |\\sec(\\theta/2)|$. We can choose the positive real root, so the normalization constant is $N = 1/\\sec(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ (assuming $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$, so $\\cos(\\theta/2) \\ge 0$).\n\n    Now, we find the normalized eigenvector:\n    $\\chi = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2)/\\cos(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option C.\n    Options A and B are incorrect as they include the constant $\\hbar$, and eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors. Option D has the wrong angular dependence ($\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$)."
