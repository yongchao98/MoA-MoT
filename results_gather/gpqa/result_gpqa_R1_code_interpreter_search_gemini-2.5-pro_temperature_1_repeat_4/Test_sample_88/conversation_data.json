    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2).\n*   **Reagents:** excess KOH, heated to 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:** A light yellow solid with an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ (indicating a ketone, C=O) and a ¹H NMR spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total proton count is 14H.\n*   The reaction is C10H14Br2 + 2KOH -> Product 1 + 2KBr + H₂O. For Product 1 to have the formula C10H14O, the reaction is a hydrolysis and rearrangement. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C10H14O is 4. Since the adamantane skeleton is tricyclic (DoU=3), the extra degree of unsaturation corresponds to the C=O bond, meaning the skeleton is otherwise saturated.\n*   The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with strong base at high temperature is a known transformation that involves skeletal rearrangement. The established product for this reaction is **protoadamantan-4-one** (also known as tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one).\n*   Let's check if this structure matches the data:\n    *   **Formula:** Protoadamantane is C10H16, so the ketone is C10H14O. This fits.\n    *   **IR:** It is a saturated tricyclic ketone, so an IR peak around 1720 cm⁻¹ is expected. This fits.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The reported literature spectrum for protoadamantan-4-one shows all protons in the 1.6-2.8 ppm range. It does **not** have a peak at 4.79 ppm.\n*   This presents a contradiction. The NMR data provided in the problem is highly unusual for a saturated ketone and does not match the known product. Given that the subsequent reaction steps must be chemically plausible, it is highly likely that the provided NMR data for Product 1 is erroneous or a red herring, and the reaction proceeds via the known literature pathway. We will proceed by assuming **Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide [Al(O-iPr)₃].\n*   This set of reagents is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces a ketone to an alcohol. Heating can also promote subsequent dehydration, especially with a Lewis acid like Al(O-iPr)₃.\n*   The overall transformation is a reduction followed by an elimination:\n    C=O → CH-OH → C=C\n*   Therefore, Product 2 is an alkene, C10H14, formed by the reduction of protoadamantan-4-one and subsequent dehydration. The most stable and likely alkene to form is **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene), where the double bond is formed between C4 and C5.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones).\n*   The ozonolysis of the C4=C5 double bond in protoadamant-4-ene cleaves the seven-membered ring of the tricyclic system, resulting in a bicyclic product. The resulting product is C10H14O2.\n*   The structure of Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one-3-carbaldehyde**. The original C4 of protoadamantene becomes the aldehyde carbon, and the original C5 becomes part of the C7 ketone group after rearrangement and bond cleavage logic. The skeleton becomes bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one-3-carbaldehyde.\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding exchangeable ones)?\n*   The most deshielded proton in this molecule is the **aldehyde proton** (-CHO), which typically appears at δ 9-10 ppm. It is coupled to the single proton on C3. According to the n+1 rule, it would be a doublet. However, \"doublet\" is not among the options (A, B, C, D).\n*   This suggests we should look for the next most deshielded proton on the carbon skeleton. This would be the proton on C3 (H3), which is alpha to the strongly electron-withdrawing aldehyde group.\n*   Let's analyze the coupling of H3:\n    *   H3 is a methine proton (CH).\n    *   It is bonded to C2 and C4.\n    *   In the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system, C2 and C4 are both methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C7, and C9. This makes the two protons on C2 chemically equivalent to the two protons on C4.\n    *   Therefore, H3 is coupled to a total of 4 neighboring protons (two on C2 and two on C4).\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, the signal for H3 will be split into (4+1) = 5 lines. This splitting pattern is called a **pentet** (or quintet).\n\n*   Let's confirm H3 is the most deshielded proton among the choices. The protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) would be the next most deshielded, but the alpha effect from an aldehyde is typically as strong or stronger than from a ketone. The bridgehead protons (H1, H5) are further away (beta to the carbonyls) and would be less deshielded than H3.\n*   Therefore, the most deshielded aliphatic proton is H3, and its coupling pattern is a pentet.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe logical chemical pathway leads to a final product where the most deshielded aliphatic proton (H3) is coupled to four neighboring protons, resulting in a pentet.\n\n<<<A>>>"
