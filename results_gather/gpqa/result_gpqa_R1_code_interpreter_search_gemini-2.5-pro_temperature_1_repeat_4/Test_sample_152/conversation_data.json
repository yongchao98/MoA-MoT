These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon (the carbon atom of the double bond further from the ester group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Conjugate Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to form another enolate intermediate.\n    *   This second enolate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Naming Product A:**\n    To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional groups (the three methyl ester groups). This is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    *   The propane chain is `C1 - C2 - C3`.\n    *   We number the chain to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the malonate end:\n        *   C1 has two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   C2 has a `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3 has one `-COOCH₃` group (it's attached to C3 via a CH₂).\n    Let's re-verify the structure and name. The structure is `(MeOOC)₂C¹H-C²H(p-tolyl)-C³H₂-COOMe`.\n    The IUPAC name is based on a propane main chain with three carboxylate groups.\n    The propane chain is `C¹-C²-C³`. The substituents are attached as follows: `(MeOOC)₂-CH¹ - CH²(p-tolyl) - CH₂³-COOMe`.\n    Numbering from the right side gives the principal groups at positions 1, 3, 3, and the p-tolyl at 2. Numbering from the left gives the principal groups at 1,1,3 and the p-tolyl at 2. The set (1,1,3) is lower than (1,3,3).\n    So, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enols and are excellent nucleophiles. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the original enone system, which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion.\n    *   The reaction is worked up with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   A cyclohexanone ring is regenerated.\n    *   A new substituent is attached at the C2 position (the α-carbon to the carbonyl).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at C2.\n\n4.  **Naming Product B:**\n    We can name this compound in two ways, but we will choose the one presented in the options. Naming the butanenitrile as the parent chain:\n    *   The parent chain is butanenitrile: `NC-C¹H₂-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃`.\n    *   The substituent is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Looking at our product structure, `(2-oxocyclohexyl)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`, the substituent is attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, more stable tautomer compared to the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants from Product (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Known Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Unknown Reactant (Michael Donor):** C.\n\n2.  **Analysis:**\n    *   A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, comes from MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) after it has been attacked at its β-carbon (`CH₂=`) and protonated.\n    *   This means the bond was formed between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the remaining part of the molecule, which is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n3.  **Verifying the Forward Reaction:**\n    *   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic methylene protons at C2 (located between two carbonyls) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Subsequent protonation yields the product, `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This confirms C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
