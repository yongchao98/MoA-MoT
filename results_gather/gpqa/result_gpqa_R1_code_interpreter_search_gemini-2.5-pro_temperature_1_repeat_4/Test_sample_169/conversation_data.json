    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the expectation value of the spin angular momentum in the y-direction, denoted as `<S_y>`, for an electron in a given spin state `|ψ>`.\n\n**2. Define the State Vector and Operator**\n*   The given spin state is `(3i, 4)`. In quantum mechanics, this is represented as a column vector (a \"ket\"):\n    `|ψ> = [ 3i ]`\n          `[  4 ]`\n*   The spin operator for the y-direction is `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n*   The Pauli Y-matrix is given as:\n    `σ_y = [ 0  -i ]`\n          `[ i   0 ]`\n*   Therefore, the `S_y` operator is:\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] = [ 0      -iħ/2 ]`\n                     `[ i   0 ]   [ iħ/2     0   ]`\n\n**3. The Formula for Expectation Value**\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ>` is given by the formula:\n`<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\nwhere:\n*   `|ψ>` is the ket vector (the column vector).\n*   `<ψ|` is the bra vector, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket.\n*   `<ψ|ψ>` is the inner product of the state with itself, which is the squared norm of the state vector. This term is for normalization.\n\n**4. Calculation Steps**\n\n**Step 4a: Find the bra vector `<ψ|`**\nTo get the bra vector, we take the transpose of the ket `|ψ>` and then take the complex conjugate of each element.\n*   Ket: `|ψ> = [3i, 4]^T`\n*   Transpose: `[3i, 4]`\n*   Complex Conjugate: `[-3i, 4]` (since the conjugate of `3i` is `-3i` and the conjugate of `4` is `4`).\n*   So, `<ψ| = [ -3i, 4 ]`\n\n**Step 4b: Calculate the normalization factor `<ψ|ψ>`**\nThis is the denominator in our expectation value formula.\n`<ψ|ψ> = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ 3i ]`\n                         `[  4 ]`\n`= (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`= -9i^2 + 16`\nSince `i^2 = -1`:\n`= -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n**Step 4c: Calculate the term `S_y|ψ>`**\nThis is the operator `S_y` acting on the state `|ψ>`.\n`S_y|ψ> = [ 0      -iħ/2 ] * [ 3i ]`\n         `[ iħ/2     0   ]   [  4 ]`\n`= [ (0)(3i) + (-iħ/2)(4) ]`\n  `[ (iħ/2)(3i) + (0)(4)   ]`\n`= [ -4iħ/2 ] = [  -2iħ  ]`\n  `[ 3i^2ħ/2 ]   [ -3ħ/2  ]`\n\n**Step 4d: Calculate the numerator `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`**\nNow we multiply the bra vector `<ψ|` with the result from the previous step.\n`<ψ|S_y|ψ> = [ -3i, 4 ] * [  -2iħ  ]`\n                           `[ -3ħ/2  ]`\n`= (-3i)(-2iħ) + (4)(-3ħ/2)`\n`= 6i^2ħ - 12ħ/2`\n`= 6i^2ħ - 6ħ`\nSince `i^2 = -1`:\n`= 6(-1)ħ - 6ħ = -6ħ - 6ħ = -12ħ`\n\n**Step 4e: Combine the numerator and denominator**\nNow we can find the final expectation value.\n`<S_y> = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n`<S_y> = (-12ħ) / 25`\n`<S_y> = -12*hbar/25`\n\nTo verify the result, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the unnormalized state vector (ket)\npsi = np.array([3j, 4])\n\n# Define the spin operator S_y. We can set hbar=1 for the calculation\n# and add it back at the end.\n# S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]])\nSy_operator_no_hbar = sigma_y / 2.0\n\n# The expectation value is given by <psi|S_y|psi> / <psi|psi>\n\n# Calculate the numerator: <psi|S_y|psi> (without hbar)\n# First, get the bra vector <psi|\npsi_bra = psi.conj().T\n# Then calculate S_y|psi>\nSy_psi = np.dot(Sy_operator_no_hbar, psi)\n# Finally, calculate the full numerator\nnumerator = np.dot(psi_bra, Sy_psi)\n\n# Calculate the denominator: <psi|psi>\ndenominator = np.dot(psi_bra, psi)\n\n# The expectation value (without hbar) is the ratio\nexpectation_value_coeff = numerator / denominator\n\n# The result must be a real number for an observable.\n# The coefficient of hbar is -12/25 = -0.48\nprint(f\"The coefficient of hbar is: {expectation_value_coeff.real}\")\n```\n\nThe calculation confirms that the expectation value of `S_y` is `-12ħ/25`. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) -12*hbar/25\nB) 12*hbar/25\nC) 25*hbar/2\nD) -25*hbar/2\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
