    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. While the specific reagents are a variation, the fundamental reaction is similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence of deprotonation and alkylation reactions, similar to a malonic ester synthesis, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt), making its protons acidic. The strong base NaH removes one proton to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide and forming a six-membered ring. This is a Thorpe-Ziegler type cyclization.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\nThe final step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:**\n    ```\n          CN\n         /\n    C(1)-------COOCH2CH3\n   /   \\\n  C(2)---C(6)\n /         \\\nC(3)-------C(5)\n \\         /\n   ---C(4)---\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 and C4 atoms, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry makes certain pairs of atoms and protons equivalent.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   **Topicity and Chemical Equivalence:** We need to identify sets of protons that are chemically equivalent. Protons are chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation or by rapid conformational changes. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct (non-equivalent).\n    *   **Diastereotopic protons** are non-equivalent and give distinct NMR signals.\n    *   **Enantiotopic protons** are equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and give a single signal.\n\n*   **Signal Analysis:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two methylene protons are diastereotopic. They are adjacent to a prochiral quaternary carbon (C1) and cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring (-C6H10-):** We assume rapid chair-chair interconversion at room temperature.\n        *   **C2 and C6 positions (4H):** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is \"cis\" and the other \"trans\" relative to the substituents on C1). Due to the plane of symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C6, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C6. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5 positions (4H):** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The protons on C3 are equivalent to their counterparts on C5 due to symmetry. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n        *   **C4 position (2H):** The C4 atom lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C4 are interchanged by reflection through this plane. This makes them enantiotopic. In an achiral solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 1 (for C4) = 5 signals\n    *   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 signals.**\n\nEach of these 8 sets of protons is chemically distinct, leading to 8 observable signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
