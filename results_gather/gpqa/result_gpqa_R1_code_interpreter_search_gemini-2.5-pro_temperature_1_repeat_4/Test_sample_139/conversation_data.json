    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues to identify the substances involved.**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W.** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Doesn't fit)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): D is an isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Fits perfectly)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely to be formed in the context of the other clues)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n        *   D₂O (Heavy water vapor): 10 protons (2 from D, 8 from O), 10 neutrons (2 from D, 8 from O). (Fits)\n\n    *   **Clue 2: The reaction.** \"Substance X... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". The release of D₂ gas strongly suggests a reaction between a deuterated reducing agent (a metal deuteride) and a proton/deuteron source like water or heavy water.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Substance B.** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\".\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is \"very close to 277 K\".\n        *   Therefore, substance B is D₂O (heavy water).\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance G.** Since heating the precipitate G releases D₂O (B), G is likely a metal deuteroxide (the deuterated analog of a metal hydroxide), which decomposes upon heating. For example, M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n2.  **Propose a candidate for Substance X.**\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The organic chemistry context.** \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Let's consider common deuterated reagents. Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) and its analog, lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), are extremely common and powerful reducing agents. NaBD₄/NaBH₄ is another pair.\n    *   LiAlH₄ is famous for reducing both ketones (>C=O) and carboxylic acids (-COOH). A keto acid contains both functional groups. The reduction of a keto acid (like pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH) with LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) followed by workup yields a diol (like 1,2-propanediol, CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH). This product contains **2 atoms of oxygen**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   Let's test LiAlD₄ as Substance X. The reaction would be with heavy water (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W), which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. (Checks out)\n    *   It produces a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate. (Checks out)\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) gives aluminum oxide and D₂O (B). 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. (Checks out)\n    *   The melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K. (Checks out)\n    *   The organic chemistry reaction with a keto acid makes sense. (Checks out)\n\n    All clues point strongly to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" implies we sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements within the molecule's formula. We will use the integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n        *   Sum = (Mass from lightest element) + (Mass from heaviest element)\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
