    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR:** The problem states that the FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. An ester group has the general formula R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) have two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with this information.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify Structural Fragments and Proton Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. Two signals for the aromatic protons typically suggest a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly a 1,4- (para-) disubstituted benzene ring. A para-substituted ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6**H4**), which appear as two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system, often simplified to two doublets). Thus, we have **4 aromatic protons**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** There are two signals for vinyl protons (protons on a C=C double bond). One is a doublet (d) and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (each peak of the doublet becomes a quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets (dq). This accounts for **1 vinyl proton**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This accounts for the second **1 vinyl proton**.\n    *   **–CH3 Groups (2 signals):** There are two signals for methyl groups.\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-**CH3**), which accounts for **3 protons**.\n        *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Since the problem states there are no –CH2 groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (e.g., -COO**CH3**) or an acetate ester (e.g., -O-CO-**CH3**). Both contain a methyl group, which accounts for another **3 protons**.\n    *   **No –CH2 Groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a -CH2- unit.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    Based on the NMR analysis, we can sum the number of protons in the molecule:\n    Total H = (Aromatic H) + (Vinyl H) + (Methyl H)\n    Total H = 4 + (1 + 1) + (3 + 3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n\n4.  **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**\n    The molecular formula must contain 12 hydrogen atoms. Let's look at the options:\n    A) C12H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    B) C11H14O2 (14 H) - **Eliminated**\n    C) C11H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    D) C12H14O2 (14 H) - **Eliminated**\n    We are now left with two choices: C12H12O2 and C11H12O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Carbon Atoms:**\n    Now, let's assemble the fragments we've identified and count the carbon atoms:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring (**C6**H4) contributes **6 carbons**.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The -CH=CH-CH3 group contributes **3 carbons**.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The ester group containing a methyl group, either -**C**OO**C**H3 or -O**C**O**C**H3, contributes **2 carbons**.\n\n    Total C = (Ring C) + (Propenyl C) + (Ester C)\n    Total C = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11 carbons**.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Chemical Formula:**\n    Based on our analysis, the molecule contains 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms.\n    The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n7.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE for C11H12O2 is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    The proposed structure contains:\n    *   One benzene ring (4 DBEs)\n    *   One C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 DBE)\n    *   One C=O double bond in the ester group (1 DBE)\n    Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The calculated DBE matches the structural features deduced from the spectra, confirming our conclusion.\n\nComparing our result with the remaining options, C11H12O2 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
