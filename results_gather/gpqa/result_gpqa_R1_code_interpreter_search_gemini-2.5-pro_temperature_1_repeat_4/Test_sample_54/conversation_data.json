    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n*   **Chemical Shift:** 2.1 ppm\n*   **Integration:** 3H (represents 3 protons)\n*   **Multiplicity:** s (singlet)\nThis signal is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O). A singlet means these 3 protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons. This perfectly describes the acetyl group (`-OCOCH₃`) present in an acetate ester. All four possible options are acetate esters, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n**2. Analyze the Remaining Signals and Determine the Carbon Chain Length:**\n*   The remaining signals are at 7.0 ppm (1H), 5.5 ppm (1H), and 1.6 ppm (3H).\n*   The total number of protons accounted for by these signals is 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons.\n*   Let's compare this to the non-acetate part of the options:\n    *   **Propenyl group** (`-CH=CH-CH₃`): Has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons. This matches the data.\n    *   **Butenyl group** (`-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`): Has 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7 protons. This does not match the data.\n*   Based on the total number of protons, the compound must be a **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and C (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Distinguish Between Cis and Trans Isomers using the Coupling Constant (J-value):**\n*   We now need to decide between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n*   The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J) for the protons on the double bond (the vinylic protons).\n*   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This coupling arises from the interaction between the two protons on the `C=C` double bond.\n*   There is a well-established rule for the magnitude of vinylic coupling constants:\n    *   **Trans-coupling (`J_trans`)** is typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (`J_cis`)** is typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   The observed value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Final Confirmation of the Structure:**\nLet's assign all the signals to the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-OCOCH₃(d)`\n*   **Protons (d) at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** The methyl group of the acetate. Correct.\n*   **Protons (a) at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** The methyl group attached to the double bond. It is split into a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single adjacent proton H(b). Correct.\n*   **Proton (c) at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz):** The vinylic proton attached to the carbon bearing the oxygen atom. It is highly deshielded (higher ppm value) due to the electronegative oxygen. It is split into a doublet (d) by the other vinylic proton, H(b), with a large trans-coupling constant. Correct.\n*   **Proton (b) at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** The vinylic proton next to the methyl group. It is split by H(c) into a doublet (d) and by the three protons of the methyl group (a) into a quartet (q), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). Correct.\n\nAll the provided data is perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
