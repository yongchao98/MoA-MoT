The relationship is `P(t) = 1 - S(t)`. The survival probability is given by the formula `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where λ is the decay constant.\n\n3.  **Calculate the decay constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   `P(100) = 0.32`\n    *   Therefore, the survival probability for 100 minutes is `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n    Using the survival formula:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:** Due to the memoryless nature of the decay, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant.

This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a classic example of a process that follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this type of process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is constant and does not depend on how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for the first 50 minutes has no impact on the probability of it decaying in the future. We can calculate the probability as if we were starting from time zero.\n\n### 2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving (not decaying) up to a certain time *t* is given by the formula:\nP(survival) = e<sup>-λt</sup>\nwhere:\n*   **e** is the base of the natural logarithm.\n*   **λ** is the decay constant.\n*   **t** is the time.\n\nThe probability of decay is therefore:\nP(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e<sup>-λt</sup>\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is:\nP(survival for 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nWe can now use this to find the decay constant λ:\n0.68 = e<sup>-λ * 100</sup>\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(0.68) = -100λ\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, the question is equivalent to asking for the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes using the decay constant we found:\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>-λ * 150</sup>\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ into this equation:\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>(-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150</sup>\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>-1.5 * ln(0.68)</sup>\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that a * ln(b) = ln(b<sup>a</sup>), we get:\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>ln(0.68<sup>1.5</sup>)</sup>\n\nSince e<sup>ln(x)</sup> = x, the equation simplifies to:\nP(survival for 150 min) = 0.68<sup>1.5</sup>\nP(survival for 150 min) ≈ 0.5607\n\nThe probability of the atom *decaying* within 150 minutes is 1 minus the probability of it surviving:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survival for 150 min)\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probability of decay is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random, memoryless process. This is a crucial concept. \"Memoryless\" means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed without decaying. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to: What is the probability that this type of atom will decay within any 150-minute interval?\n\n**2. Model the Decay Mathematically**\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\nP(survival, t) = e^(-λt)\n\nWhere:\n*   `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom.\n*   `t` is the time interval.\n\nThe probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is:\nP(decay, t) = 1 - P(survival, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP(decay, 100) = 0.32\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nWe don't need to calculate the exact value of `λ` yet. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability for the New Time Interval**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As established in Step 1, this is equivalent to finding the probability of decay for any 150-minute interval.\nP(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the relationship we found in Step 3:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value from Step 3:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n(0.68)^1.5 = (0.68) * √(0.68) ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nThis is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes.\n\n**5. Find the Final Answer**\n\nThe probability of the atom *decaying* in 150 minutes is:\nP(decay, 150) = 1 - P(survival, 150)\nP(decay, 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\nP(decay, 150) ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get 43.93%, which is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics and Mathematics of Radioactive Decay:**\n    *   Radioactive decay is a random process. The probability of a single atom decaying does not depend on its age. This is known as the **memoryless property**.\n    *   This means the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its probability of decaying in any future time interval.\n    *   The problem is mathematically described by the exponential decay law. The probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` is given by `P(survival, t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is `P(decay, t) = 1 - P(survival, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n    *   Using the formula: `P(decay, 100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   This equation relates the decay constant `λ` to the given time and probability. We don't necessarily need to solve for `λ` itself, but we can use this relationship.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically:**\n    *   We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes.\n    *   Because of the memoryless property, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant. The question is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a newly observed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n    *   So, we need to calculate `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can use the information from Step 2: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   Let's use the rules of exponents to relate the two expressions:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^((-λ * 100) * (150/100)) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(1.5)`.\n    *   Now, substitute the value we found in Step 2:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   Let's calculate `(0.68)^1.5`:\n        `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   This value, `0.5607`, is the probability that the atom will *survive* for 150 minutes.\n    *   The probability that it will *decay* in 150 minutes is:\n        `P(decay, 150) = 1 - P(survival, 150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated probability is `0.4393`, which is 43.93%.\n    *   Looking at the given options:\n        A) 48%\n        B) 44%\n        C) 40%\n        D) 52%\n    *   The value 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property:** This is the most critical concept. Forgetting this would lead to a much more complicated (and incorrect) conditional probability calculation. The 50 minutes of survival time is extraneous information designed to test this understanding.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** Be careful to distinguish between the probability of decay (`1 - e^(-λt)`) and the probability of survival (`e^(-λt)`). The initial information is about decay, and the final calculation requires finding the decay probability.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The calculation is made simpler by manipulating the exponents (`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`) rather than explicitly calculating `λ`, which would involve logarithms and could introduce rounding errors.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Probability of survival for 100 minutes = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n2.  Let S(t) be the survival probability for time t. So, S(100) = 0.68.\n3.  We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless nature of decay, this is simply the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, which is 1 - S(150).\n4.  S(t) = e^(-λt). Therefore, S(150) = e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (S(100))^1.5.\n5.  S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607.\n6.  Probability of decay in 150 minutes = 1 - S(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393.\n7.  0.4393 is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The decay of a single radioactive atom is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived.

Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of an atom *not* decaying within a certain time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n\n*P(survival) = e^(-λt)*\n\nWhere:\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n*   `λ` is the decay constant, which is unique to the atomic nucleus in question.\n*   `t` is the time interval.\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. This means the probability of survival is:\n\n*P(survival in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68*\n\nNow, we can use this information to find the decay constant `λ`:\n\n*0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)*\n\nTo solve for `λ`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n*ln(0.68) = -100λ*\n\n*λ = -ln(0.68) / 100*\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because the process is memoryless, this is equivalent to calculating the decay probability for a fresh atom over a 150-minute period.\n\nThe probability of decay within a time `t` is:\n\n*P(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)*\n\nWe will use the `λ` we found in the previous step and set `t = 150` minutes:\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)*\n\nSubstitute the expression for `λ`:\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)*\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * 1.5)*\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that `e^(ln(x)) = x`, we can simplify:\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (e^ln(0.68))^1.5*\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5*\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n\n*   First, calculate `0.68` raised to the power of `1.5`:\n    *(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.558*\n*   Next, subtract this value from 1:\n    *1 - 0.558 = 0.442*\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n*0.442 * 100 = 44.2%*\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic problem involving the \"memoryless\" property of exponential decay. Radioactive decay follows this principle, which means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its inherent decay probability for any future period.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:** Let S(t) be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time t. The decay probability is P(t) = 1 - S(t). The survival probability follows an exponential decay law: S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   P(100) = 0.32\n    *   This means the survival probability S(100) is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    *   Using the formula: 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100).\n\n3.  **Address the Memoryless Property:** The question asks for the probability of decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Because the process is memoryless, the 50 minutes of survival are irrelevant to the future probability. We simply need to calculate the probability of decay for a fresh 150-minute interval.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes:** We need to find P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n    *   We can rewrite e^(-λ * 150) as (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5.\n    *   From step 2, we know that e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68.\n    *   Therefore, S(150) = (0.68)^1.5.\n    *   S(150) ≈ 0.5607.\n    *   The probability of decay in 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393.\n\n5.  **Final Answer:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.

For any single unstable nucleus, the probability of it decaying in a given time interval is constant, regardless of how long it has already existed. This is known as the **memoryless property**. This means the fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes has no bearing on its probability of decaying in the future. The \"clock\" effectively resets at the 50-minute mark.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Model:**\n    The probability of a single atom *surviving* (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    Consequently, the probability of the atom *decaying* within a time `t` is:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Data to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n    Using our formula:\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    Rearranging the equation to find the survival probability:\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n    This equation relates the decay constant `λ` to the known experimental data. We don't need to calculate the exact value of `λ`; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n4.  **Define the Question Mathematically:**\n    We are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   Let A be the event \"the atom decays in the next 150 minutes\" (i.e., between t=50 and t=200).\n    *   Let B be the event \"the atom has not decayed by t=50\".\n    We want to find the conditional probability P(A|B).\n\n5.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    Because of the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, the condition that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay. Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    So, we just need to calculate `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We need to find the value of `e^(-150λ)`. We can use the relationship we found in Step 3: `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    Using the rules of exponents:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the known value:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    Let's calculate this value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * (0.68)^0.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68)`\n    `sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246`\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n    This is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of it *decaying* in 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This is closest to option A, 44%.\n\n### Formal Conditional Probability (Optional Confirmation)\nThe probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200, given survival up to t=50 is:\n`P(decay in [50, 200] | survive up to 50) = P(decay in [50, 200] AND survive up to 50) / P(survive up to 50)`\nThe event \"decay in [50, 200] AND survive up to 50\" is the same as \"survive up to 50 and then decay before 200\". This is `P(survive up to 50) - P(survive up to 200)`.\nSo, the probability is `(P_survive(50) - P_survive(200)) / P_survive(50)`\n`= (e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)) / e^(-50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-200λ) / e^(-50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-200λ + 50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-150λ)`\nThis confirms that the result is simply the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, as deduced from the memoryless property.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay is a random, memoryless process.

We simply need to calculate the probability that a new atom of this type would decay within a 150-minute period.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant:** The probability of decay, `P(t)`, within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant and `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\n    Rearranging this, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes:** We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is `P(150)`.\n    `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    We can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the value we found in the previous step:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Now, we calculate the value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\n    This is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes.

The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic decay characteristics.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):** The decay constant is a measure of the decay probability per unit of time. We can calculate it from the initial information provided. The probability of decay, P(decay), within a time *t* is given by the formula:\n\n    P(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay is 32% (or 0.32) in 100 minutes.

The key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the decay constant, λ, from the initial information: a 32% probability of decay in 100 minutes. The survival probability, P(T > t), is given by e^(-λt). Therefore, the decay probability is 1 - e^(-λt).\n    *   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    *   e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n2.  Next, we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability: P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50).\n3.  Due to the memoryless property, this conditional probability is equal to the unconditional probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval starting from time zero: P(T < 150).\n4.  Calculate P(T < 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n5.  From step 1, we have e^(-100λ) = 0.68. We can write e^(-150λ) as (e^(-100λ))^(1.5), which is 0.68^1.5.\n6.  The final probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5.

However, the entire answer hinges on the correct application of this principle and the subsequent calculation. My main concern is ensuring the calculation is precise, as the multiple-choice options are relatively close to each other. A search that also confirms the formula for conditional probability in radioactive decay would add confidence to the result.\n\nDecide: The proposed path is logical. The next step is to execute the calculation and verify the underlying principle. A combined search can achieve this.\n\nProposer: The search results confirm my initial approach. Result explicitly states the memoryless property of processes like radioactive decay: \"P(T > t + s | T > s) = P(T > t)\". This means the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes it has already survived. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the unconditional probability of decay within 150 minutes. My calculation path remains the same: find the decay constant λ from the first condition and then use it to find the probability for a 150-minute interval. The final calculation is `1 - 0.68^1.5`.\n\nSkeptic: I agree. The search results, particularly and, strongly support the use of the memoryless property for single-atom decay. The problem is now reduced to a straightforward calculation. The key is to perform this calculation accurately to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\nDecide: The debate has converged.

Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a classic example of a process that follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this type of process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is constant and does not depend on how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for the first 50 minutes has no impact on the probability of it decaying in the future. We can calculate the probability as if we were starting from time zero.\n\n### 2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving (not decaying) up to a certain time *t* is given by the formula:\nP(survival) = e<sup>-λt</sup>\nwhere:\n*   **e** is the base of the natural logarithm.\n*   **λ** is the decay constant.\n*   **t** is the time.\n\nThe probability of decay is therefore:\nP(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e<sup>-λt</sup>\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is:\nP(survival for 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nWe can now use this to find the decay constant λ:\n0.68 = e<sup>-λ * 100</sup>\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(0.68) = -100λ\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, the question is equivalent to asking for the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes using the decay constant we found:\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>-λ * 150</sup>\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ into this equation:\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>(-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150</sup>\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>-1.5 * ln(0.68)</sup>\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that a * ln(b) = ln(b<sup>a</sup>), we get:\nP(survival for 150 min) = e<sup>ln(0.68<sup>1.5</sup>)</sup>\n\nSince e<sup>ln(x)</sup> = x, the equation simplifies to:\nP(survival for 150 min) = 0.68<sup>1.5</sup>\nP(survival for 150 min) ≈ 0.5607\n\nThe probability of the atom *decaying* within 150 minutes is 1 minus the probability of it surviving:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survival for 150 min)\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393\n\n### 4.

This is a crucial concept. \"Memoryless\" means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed without decaying. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to: What is the probability that this type of atom will decay within any 150-minute interval?\n\n**2.

This relationship is sufficient.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability for the New Time Interval**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As established in Step 1, this is equivalent to finding the probability of decay for any 150-minute interval.\nP(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the relationship we found in Step 3:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value from Step 3:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n(0.68)^1.5 = (0.68) * √(0.68) ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nThis is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes.\n\n**5. Find the Final Answer**\n\nThe probability of the atom *decaying* in 150 minutes is:\nP(decay, 150) = 1 - P(survival, 150)\nP(decay, 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\nP(decay, 150) ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get 43.93%, which is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics and Mathematics of Radioactive Decay:**\n    *   Radioactive decay is a random process. The probability of a single atom decaying does not depend on its age. This is known as the **memoryless property**.\n    *   This means the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its probability of decaying in any future time interval.\n    *   The problem is mathematically described by the exponential decay law. The probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` is given by `P(survival, t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is `P(decay, t) = 1 - P(survival, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n    *   Using the formula: `P(decay, 100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   This equation relates the decay constant `λ` to the given time and probability. We don't necessarily need to solve for `λ` itself, but we can use this relationship.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically:**\n    *   We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes.\n    *   Because of the memoryless property, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant. The question is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a newly observed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n    *   So, we need to calculate `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can use the information from Step 2: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   Let's use the rules of exponents to relate the two expressions:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^((-λ * 100) * (150/100)) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(1.5)`.\n    *   Now, substitute the value we found in Step 2:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   Let's calculate `(0.68)^1.5`:\n        `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   This value, `0.5607`, is the probability that the atom will *survive* for 150 minutes.\n    *   The probability that it will *decay* in 150 minutes is:\n        `P(decay, 150) = 1 - P(survival, 150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated probability is `0.4393`, which is 43.93%.\n    *   Looking at the given options:\n        A) 48%\n        B) 44%\n        C) 40%\n        D) 52%\n    *   The value 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property:** This is the most critical concept. Forgetting this would lead to a much more complicated (and incorrect) conditional probability calculation. The 50 minutes of survival time is extraneous information designed to test this understanding.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** Be careful to distinguish between the probability of decay (`1 - e^(-λt)`) and the probability of survival (`e^(-λt)`). The initial information is about decay, and the final calculation requires finding the decay probability.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The calculation is made simpler by manipulating the exponents (`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`) rather than explicitly calculating `λ`, which would involve logarithms and could introduce rounding errors.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Probability of survival for 100 minutes = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n2.  Let S(t) be the survival probability for time t. So, S(100) = 0.68.\n3.  We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless nature of decay, this is simply the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, which is 1 - S(150).\n4.  S(t) = e^(-λt). Therefore, S(150) = e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (S(100))^1.5.\n5.  S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607.\n6.

This means the probability of survival is:\n\n*P(survival in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68*\n\nNow, we can use this information to find the decay constant `λ`:\n\n*0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)*\n\nTo solve for `λ`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n*ln(0.68) = -100λ*\n\n*λ = -ln(0.68) / 100*\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because the process is memoryless, this is equivalent to calculating the decay probability for a fresh atom over a 150-minute period.\n\nThe probability of decay within a time `t` is:\n\n*P(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)*\n\nWe will use the `λ` we found in the previous step and set `t = 150` minutes:\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)*\n\nSubstitute the expression for `λ`:\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)*\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * 1.5)*\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that `e^(ln(x)) = x`, we can simplify:\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (e^ln(0.68))^1.5*\n\n*P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5*\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n\n*   First, calculate `0.68` raised to the power of `1.5`:\n    *(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.558*\n*   Next, subtract this value from 1:\n    *1 - 0.558 = 0.442*\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n*0.442 * 100 = 44.2%*\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic problem involving the \"memoryless\" property of exponential decay. Radioactive decay follows this principle, which means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its inherent decay probability for any future period.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:** Let S(t) be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time t. The decay probability is P(t) = 1 - S(t). The survival probability follows an exponential decay law: S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   P(100) = 0.32\n    *   This means the survival probability S(100) is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    *   Using the formula: 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100).\n\n3.  **Address the Memoryless Property:** The question asks for the probability of decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Because the process is memoryless, the 50 minutes of survival are irrelevant to the future probability. We simply need to calculate the probability of decay for a fresh 150-minute interval.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes:** We need to find P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n    *   We can rewrite e^(-λ * 150) as (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5.\n    *   From step 2, we know that e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68.\n    *   Therefore, S(150) = (0.68)^1.5.\n    *   S(150) ≈ 0.5607.\n    *   The probability of decay in 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393.\n\n5.  **Final Answer:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay:**\n    Radioactive decay is a random, quantum process. For any single unstable nucleus, the probability of it decaying in a given time interval is constant, regardless of how long it has already existed. This is known as the **memoryless property**. This means the fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes has no bearing on its probability of decaying in the future. The \"clock\" effectively resets at the 50-minute mark.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Model:**\n    The probability of a single atom *surviving* (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    Consequently, the probability of the atom *decaying* within a time `t` is:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Data to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n    Using our formula:\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    Rearranging the equation to find the survival probability:\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n    This equation relates the decay constant `λ` to the known experimental data. We don't need to calculate the exact value of `λ`; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n4.  **Define the Question Mathematically:**\n    We are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   Let A be the event \"the atom decays in the next 150 minutes\" (i.e., between t=50 and t=200).\n    *   Let B be the event \"the atom has not decayed by t=50\".\n    We want to find the conditional probability P(A|B).\n\n5.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    Because of the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, the condition that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay. Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    So, we just need to calculate `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We need to find the value of `e^(-150λ)`. We can use the relationship we found in Step 3: `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    Using the rules of exponents:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the known value:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    Let's calculate this value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * (0.68)^0.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68)`\n    `sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246`\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n    This is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of it *decaying* in 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This is closest to option A, 44%.\n\n### Formal Conditional Probability (Optional Confirmation)\nThe probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200, given survival up to t=50 is:\n`P(decay in [50, 200] | survive up to 50) = P(decay in [50, 200] AND survive up to 50) / P(survive up to 50)`\nThe event \"decay in [50, 200] AND survive up to 50\" is the same as \"survive up to 50 and then decay before 200\". This is `P(survive up to 50) - P(survive up to 200)`.\nSo, the probability is `(P_survive(50) - P_survive(200)) / P_survive(50)`\n`= (e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)) / e^(-50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-200λ) / e^(-50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-200λ + 50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-150λ)`\nThis confirms that the result is simply the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, as deduced from the memoryless property.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay is a random, memoryless process. This \"memoryless\" property is crucial: the probability that an atom will decay in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes. We simply need to calculate the probability that a new atom of this type would decay within a 150-minute period.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant:** The probability of decay, `P(t)`, within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant and `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\n    Rearranging this, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes:** We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is `P(150)`.\n    `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    We can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the value we found in the previous step:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Now, we calculate the value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\n    This is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes. To find the probability of it *decaying*, we subtract this from 1:\n    `P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.

This principle states that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic decay characteristics.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):** The decay constant is a measure of the decay probability per unit of time. We can calculate it from the initial information provided. The probability of decay, P(decay), within a time *t* is given by the formula:\n\n    P(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay is 32% (or 0.32) in 100 minutes. We can plug these values into the formula:\n\n    0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\n    By rearranging the equation to solve for λ, we get:\n\n    e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n    -100λ = ln(0.68)\n    λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:** Because of the memoryless property, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to the future decay probability. Therefore, we simply need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in any 150-minute period.\n\n    We use the same formula with the new time interval (t = 150 minutes) and the decay constant (λ) we just found:\n\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n3.  **Substitute and solve:** Now, we substitute the expression for λ into the equation:\n\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^[1.5 * ln(0.68)]\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^[ln(0.68^1.5)]\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\n    Calculating the final value:\n\n    0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n    P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability of approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%, is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: The problem describes a classic scenario of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the decay constant, λ, from the initial information: a 32% probability of decay in 100 minutes. The survival probability, P(T > t), is given by e^(-λt). Therefore, the decay probability is 1 - e^(-λt).\n    *   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    *   e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n2.  Next, we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability: P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50).\n3.  Due to the memoryless property, this conditional probability is equal to the unconditional probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval starting from time zero: P(T < 150).\n4.  Calculate P(T < 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n5.  From step 1, we have e^(-100λ) = 0.68. We can write e^(-150λ) as (e^(-100λ))^(1.5), which is 0.68^1.5.\n6.  The final probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5. I will use a search query to perform this calculation accurately.\n\nMy proposed action is to use a search engine to calculate the final numerical value.\n\nSkeptic: The reasoning seems solid, especially the application of the memoryless property, which is a fundamental concept in exponential decay processes. However, the entire answer hinges on the correct application of this principle and the subsequent calculation. My main concern is ensuring the calculation is precise, as the multiple-choice options are relatively close to each other. A search that also confirms the formula for conditional probability in radioactive decay would add confidence to the result.\n\nDecide: The proposed path is logical. The next step is to execute the calculation and verify the underlying principle. A combined search can achieve this.\n\nProposer: The search results confirm my initial approach. Result explicitly states the memoryless property of processes like radioactive decay: \"P(T > t + s | T > s) = P(T > t)\". This means the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes it has already survived. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the unconditional probability of decay within 150 minutes. My calculation path remains the same: find the decay constant λ from the first condition and then use it to find the probability for a 150-minute interval. The final calculation is `1 - 0.68^1.5`.\n\nSkeptic: I agree. The search results, particularly and, strongly support the use of the memoryless property for single-atom decay. The problem is now reduced to a straightforward calculation. The key is to perform this calculation accurately to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\nDecide: The debate has converged. The physical principle is confirmed, and the calculation is clear. The next and final step is to perform the calculation and select the answer.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define Survival Probability:** The probability that an atom survives past time `t` is `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n2.  **Use Given Information:** We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. This means the survival probability is 100% - 32% = 68%.\n    *   `P(T > 100) = e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived for 50 minutes. This is `P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50)`. Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, this is equal to the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, `P(T < 150)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    *   `P(T < 150) = 1 - P(T > 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` as `(e^(-100λ))^(150/100)` or `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    *   From step 2, we know `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    *   Substituting this value gives: `1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Calculating the value: `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   The final probability is `1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.
