  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Information**: The spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This confirms the presence of two oxygen atoms in the molecule. All four possible answers have \"O2\" in their formula, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**:\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H**: A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical arrangement, such as a para (1,4) substitution, which would result in two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by one other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups**: One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH₃). The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality, indicating a methyl ester (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups**: This is a crucial constraint. It rules out substituents like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), or allyl (-CH₂CH=CH₂).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure**: Based on the analysis, the compound consists of:\n    *   A benzene ring (C₆H₄)\n    *   A propenyl group (-C₃H₅)\n    *   A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃, which contributes C₂H₃O₂)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Chemical Formula**: Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from the benzene ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 1 (from the carbonyl group) + 1 (from the methyl part of the ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from the aromatic ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group: -CH=CH-C**H₃**) + 3 (from the methyl ester group) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from the ester group)\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This corresponds to a structure like methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**:\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: Incorrect. This would likely contain a propyl group instead of a propenyl group, which would have -CH₂ signals.\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: Incorrect. A plausible structure would be ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, but this contains an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and is thus ruled out by the absence of -CH₂ signals.\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: Incorrect. It is difficult to construct a molecule with this formula that matches all the spectral data without including -CH₂ groups or other features that contradict the NMR data.\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: Correct. This formula perfectly matches the structure deduced from the FTIR and NMR spectra.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the following deductions can be made to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the chemical formula options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which has the formula -C₆H₄-. The presence of two signals for these aromatic protons suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which would result in two chemically distinct sets of protons.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** The absence of signals for methylene (-CH₂) groups is a critical clue. This eliminates the possibility of an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or other similar structures.\n    *   **Two –CH₃ groups:** There are two distinct signals for methyl groups. One must be part of the ester, making it a methyl ester (-COOCH₃), as this contains no -CH₂ group. The other methyl group must be part of the second substituent on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** The presence of two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) indicates a double bond in the second substituent. The splitting pattern provides more detail:\n        *   A *doublet of quartets* for one vinyl proton means it is coupled to one other vinyl proton (creating the doublet) and a methyl group (creating the quartet).\n        *   A *doublet* for the other vinyl proton means it is coupled to only the first vinyl proton.\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:** The pieces are a di-substituted benzene ring (-C₆H₄-), a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃), and a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). Assembling these gives a structure of methyl propenylbenzoate.\n\n4.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 from the benzene ring + 1 from the carbonyl (C=O) + 1 from the methyl of the ester (OCH₃) + 3 from the propenyl group = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 from the aromatic ring + 3 from the methyl of the ester + 5 from the propenyl group (1+1+3) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 from the ester group.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A 6-membered aromatic ring (like benzene) has a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, which contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The 1H NMR shows signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). This C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total DoU:** The minimum DoU based on the identified functional groups is 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for Each Possible Formula:**\n    The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. This does not match the required DoU of 6.\n    *   B) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. This matches.\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. This also matches.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This does not match.\n\n    Based on the DoU, the correct formula must be either **B) C11H12O2** or **C) C12H14O2**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring (C6H4):** A di-substituted 6-membered ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals for these protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para) substitution.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The problem states there are **no signals for –CH2 groups**. An ester has the general structure R-COO-R'. If R' were an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), we would see a -CH2- signal. Since there is none, the simplest possibility for R' is a methyl group (-CH3). This gives us a **methyl ester** fragment (-COOCH3) and accounts for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n    *   **Vinyl Group & Second -CH3:** There are two vinyl protons. One is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to only one other proton. The other is a doublet of quartets (dq), meaning it's coupled to one proton (the other vinyl H) and a group of three protons (a -CH3 group). This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). This fragment accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and the second –CH3 signal.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    We have the following pieces:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring: C6H4\n    *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n    *   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n\n    Assembling these gives a structure like methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. Let's count the atoms in this complete structure:\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from -OCH3) + 3 (from propenyl) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from -OCH3) + 5 (from propenyl) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The deduced formula C11H12O2 matches option B. The other possibility with the correct DoU, C12H14O2 (Option C), contains an extra CH2 unit compared to our deduced structure. The explicit absence of –CH2 signals in the NMR spectrum rules out this option.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information from the problem statement.**\n\n1.  **Molecular Framework:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The core formula for this part is C6H4. The degree of unsaturation for the ring itself is 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n2.  **Functional Group (FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms (C, O2) and adds one degree of unsaturation due to the C=O double bond.\n3.  **Proton NMR (1H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C6H4). Having only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4-substitution). In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents, the four protons form two chemically distinct sets (an AA'BB' system), which often appears as two signals (two doublets).\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** This indicates the presence of a C=C double bond with a proton on each carbon. Let's call them Ha and Hb.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Ha) is coupled to only one other proton (Hb).\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Hb) is coupled to two different groups of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet, which must be Ha) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, which must be a -CH3 group).\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group would be the doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton would be the doublet.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n        *   One -CH3 group is already identified as part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be located elsewhere. Given the presence of an ester group, a methyl ester (-COOCH3) is a very common and plausible structure. A methyl group in this position would be a singlet, as it's not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out structures containing ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or other alkyl chains with methylene groups.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we have the following pieces:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n*   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n*   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n\nLet's combine these to form the complete molecule. The two substituents on the benzene ring are the propenyl group and the methyl ester group.\n\nThe proposed structure is: **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n      CH3\n       |\n      (O=)C-O\n       |\n      / \\\n     |   |\n    // \\\\ //\n   |     |\n    \\\\ // \\\\\n     |   |\n      \\ /\n       |\n      CH=CH-CH3\n```\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Di-substituted aromatic ring:** Yes.\n*   **Ester group:** Yes (-COOCH3).\n*   **Aromatic-H:** Yes, 4 protons in a para arrangement, giving 2 signals.\n*   **Vinyl-H:** Yes, the -CH=CH- part gives 2 signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets).\n*   **-CH3 groups:** Yes, two of them. One in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) and one in the methyl ester (-COOCH3). They are in different chemical environments, so they will give two separate signals.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** Yes, the structure contains no -CH2- groups.\n\nThe proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the chemical formula from the proposed structure.**\n\nNow, we count the atoms in the structure CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3.\n*   **Carbon (C):** 1 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from -CH=CH-) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from -COO-) + 1 (from ester CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 3 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from -CH=CH-) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from ester CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester -COO-) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C11H12O2\n*   D) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe user has provided the output from the code execution. I will now complete the reasoning process and provide the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of Code Output and Further Reasoning\n\nThe Python code calculated the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for each of the possible chemical formulas. The DBE represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n1.  **DBE from Structural Fragments:**\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, contributing 4 to the DBE.\n    *   An ester group has a C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the DBE.\n    *   The presence of vinyl-H signals indicates a C=C double bond, contributing 1 to the DBE.\n    *   **Total required DBE = 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6.**\n\n2.  **DBE from Provided Formulas (Code Output):**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DBE = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DBE = 6 (Possible)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DBE = 6 (Possible)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DBE = 7 (Incorrect)\n\nThe DBE calculation narrows down the possibilities to **B (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**.\n\n### Distinguishing Between B and C using NMR Data\n\nNow, we must use the specific fragment information from the ¹H NMR spectrum to determine the exact number of carbons and hydrogens.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄ (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens)\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The \"doublet\" and \"doublet of quartets\" pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH₃**. This fragment contains 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (1+1+3).\n*   **Methyl Groups:** There are two -CH₃ signals. One belongs to the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester. Since there are **no -CH₂ signals**, the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). It must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH₃). In either case, this second methyl group adds 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.\n*   **Ester Carbonyl:** The C=O part of the ester adds 1 carbon.\n\nLet's sum the atoms from these identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the second CH₃) + 1 (from the ester C=O) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the second CH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe molecular formula assembled from all the spectroscopic evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches option B.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider why option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is incorrect. The difference between our derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is one carbon and two hydrogens (a CH₂ group). The problem statement explicitly says, \"**There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\" Therefore, option C is inconsistent with the provided data.\n\nThe only formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, we can deduce the structure and subsequently the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring and Ester:** The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`) and contains an ester group (`-COO-`). The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens, and a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 4. The ester's C=O bond adds another degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **NMR Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which has a plane of symmetry, resulting in two sets of chemically equivalent aromatic protons. This accounts for 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, d & dq):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The `CH` adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton into a doublet (d). The other vinyl `CH` is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). This group adds 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`-C3H5`) and one C=C double bond (1 DoU).\n    *   **-CH3 Groups (2 signals):** One methyl group is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other methyl group must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No -CH2 Groups:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) or have any other alkyl chain with a -CH2- unit. Therefore, the second methyl group must be either from a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure and Formula:**\n    Let's assemble the pieces: a para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`), a propenyl group (`-C3H5`), an ester group (`-COO-`), and a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The structure contains one benzene ring (4 DoU), one C=C double bond (1 DoU), and one C=O double bond (1 DoU). The total DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the formula C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   This matches perfectly. The other options either have the wrong DoU (A and D) or imply the presence of a -CH2- group (C), which is contradicted by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4. The presence of an aromatic ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O double bond in the ester accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - Six signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR - Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern with two different substituents, which would give a characteristic pair of doublets (an AA'BB' system).\n    *   **1H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic splitting pattern for a `CH3-CH=CH-` group.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet). The resulting signal is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d).\n        *   This fragment confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl groups is part of the `CH3-CH=CH-` fragment identified above. This means there must be a second, chemically distinct methyl group somewhere else in the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR - No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates many potential structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments:**\n    Based on the analysis above, the molecule must contain the following pieces:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n    *   An ester group: `-COO-`\n    *   A propenyl group: `CH3-CH=CH-` (which has a formula of `C3H5` when attached to another group)\n    *   A methyl group: `-CH3`\n\n3.  **Construct a Plausible Structure and Determine its Formula:**\n    Let's assemble these fragments. There are two primary ways they can be connected that are consistent with the data:\n\n    *   **Structure A:** The ester is a methyl ester, and the propenyl group is attached to the ring.\n        *   `CH3-CH=CH-`[ring]`-COO-CH3` (e.g., Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate)\n    *   **Structure B:** The ester is a phenyl ester (specifically, a tolyl ester), and the rest of the molecule forms the acyl group.\n        *   `CH3-CH=CH-CO-O-`[ring]`-CH3` (e.g., 4-methylphenyl but-2-enoate or p-tolyl crotonate)\n\n    Now, let's determine the chemical formula for these structures.\n    *   **For Structure A:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester CH3) = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester CH3) = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 (ester)\n        *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n    *   **For Structure B:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 3 (alkene chain) + 1 (ester C=O) + 6 (ring) + 1 (ring CH3) = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 5 (alkene chain) + 4 (ring) + 3 (ring CH3) = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 (ester)\n        *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n    Both plausible structures that fit all the spectroscopic data have the same chemical formula: **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) C12H14O2:** Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) = 6. This formula is C11H12O2 + CH2. To make a valid structure, a -CH2- group would need to be added, which is explicitly contradicted by the NMR data.\n    *   **B) C11H12O2:** DBE = 6. This matches the formula derived from the structural fragments and is consistent with all the data (aromatic ring=4, C=O=1, C=C=1).\n    *   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 5. This is inconsistent. It lacks a degree of unsaturation, meaning it couldn't have the C=C vinyl group required by the NMR data.\n    *   **D) C12H12O2:** DBE = 7. This is inconsistent. It has an extra degree of unsaturation (an extra ring or double bond) that is not supported by the data.\n\nBased on this systematic analysis, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided information is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Deduce the structural fragments of the unknown compound from the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data.\n    2.  Assemble these fragments into a complete, plausible chemical structure that satisfies all the given constraints (di-substituted aromatic, ester, specific NMR signals, no –CH2– groups).\n    3.  Calculate the molecular formula of the deduced structure and match it with the given options.\n\n*   **Action (Execution of Plan):**\n\n    1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n        *   **FTIR:** An ester group (–COO–) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the formula options.\n        *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core. The presence of only two aromatic-H signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is C6H4.\n        *   **Vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton coupled to both another vinyl proton and a methyl group gives the doublet of quartets. This fragment is C3H5.\n        *   **Two –CH3 signals:** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (–CH=CH–**CH3**). The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **No –CH2– signals:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3) or a propanoate (–CH2COO–), for example.\n\n    2.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n        *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n        *   One substituent is the propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n        *   The other substituent must be an ester containing a methyl group, with no methylene (–CH2–) groups. This leaves two possibilities for this substituent:\n            *   An acetate group: –O–CO–CH3\n            *   A methoxycarbonyl group (methyl ester): –COO–CH3\n\n    3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n        *   **Possibility 1:** The molecule is 4-propenylphenyl acetate.\n            *   Fragments: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (acetate group)\n            *   Total Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n            *   Total Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n            *   Total Oxygens: 2\n            *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n        *   **Possibility 2:** The molecule is methyl 4-propenylbenzoate.\n            *   Fragments: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (methoxycarbonyl group)\n            *   Total Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n            *   Total Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n            *   Total Oxygens: 2\n            *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n    Both plausible structures that fit all the spectroscopic data have the same molecular formula: C11H12O2. This formula corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present. This functional group contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which corresponds to a C₆H₄ fragment.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The presence of two signals for the four aromatic protons suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which results in a symmetrical structure.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** There are two hydrogens on a carbon-carbon double bond. The splitting patterns are key:\n        *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** indicates a hydrogen that is split by one adjacent hydrogen (doublet) and by a group of three hydrogens, like a methyl group (quartet).\n        *   A **doublet (d)** indicates a hydrogen that is split by only one adjacent hydrogen.\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group appears as a doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl hydrogen appears as a doublet.\n    *   **-CH₃ Groups (2 signals):** There are two distinct methyl groups. One belongs to the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester group (e.g., a methyl ester or an acetate).\n    *   **No -CH₂ Groups:** The absence of any methylene (-CH₂) signals is a crucial constraint for the final structure.\n\n### 2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments\n\nBased on the analysis, we can identify the following pieces of the molecule:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n2.  **Substituent 1 (from vinyl and one CH₃ signal):** A propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH₃. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n3.  **Substituent 2 (from FTIR and the second CH₃ signal):** An ester group containing a methyl group. To avoid having a -CH₂- group, this must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Chemical Formula\n\nNow, we add up the atoms from all the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches the spectral data perfectly. It accounts for the di-substituted aromatic ring, the ester group, the propenyl group with its specific NMR splitting pattern, two distinct methyl groups, and the absence of any methylene groups. Comparing this to the given options, it corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe analysis of the provided spectroscopic data allows for a step-by-step deduction of the unknown compound's structure and, consequently, its chemical formula.\n\n### Spectroscopic Data Analysis:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with two signals corresponding to the four aromatic hydrogens.\n\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** The presence of an ester functional group (-COO-) is confirmed. This adds two oxygen atoms to the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the C6H4 ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The doublet arises from one vinyl proton being split by the other vinyl proton. The doublet of quartets arises from the second vinyl proton being split by both the first vinyl proton and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3), as that would produce a –CH2 signal.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Structure:\n\nBased on the data, the molecule is composed of the following fragments:\n*   A C6H4 (aromatic ring) fragment.\n*   A -COO- (ester) fragment.\n*   A -CH=CH-CH3 (propenyl) fragment, which accounts for the vinyl and one methyl signal.\n*   A -CH3 (methyl) fragment, which must be part of the ester group.\n\nTo satisfy the \"no –CH2 groups\" rule, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-O-CO-CH3). Both arrangements lead to the same molecular formula.\n\nLet's calculate the formula by summing the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 1 (from the carbonyl C in the ester) + 1 (from the methyl C in the ester) + 3 (from the propenyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 3 (from the ester's methyl group) + 5 (from the propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This formula is consistent with known isomers like ethyl cinnamate and methyl isoeugenol, which fit the structural features deduced from the spectra.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the unknown compound can be determined by systematically analyzing each piece of data.\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group indicates the molecule contains a -COO- functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms. All the proposed formulas (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this, as they each contain two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The proton NMR spectrum provides the most detailed information for identifying the molecular structure's components and, subsequently, its formula.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm) correspond to the protons on a di-substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring with two substituents has the formula C₆H₄, meaning there are 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals for vinyl protons indicate the presence of a -CH=CH- group. The splitting patterns are key: one signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets for a vinyl proton strongly suggests it is coupled to another vinyl proton (giving the doublet) and to a methyl (-CH₃) group (giving the quartet). This points to a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) as a fragment. This fragment contains 2 vinyl hydrogens.\n    *   **Methyl Protons**: The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One of these is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be located elsewhere in the molecule. In total, these two methyl groups account for 2 x 3 = 6 hydrogens.\n    *   **Absence of -CH₂ Groups**: The lack of any signals corresponding to methylene (-CH₂) groups is a crucial constraint on the possible structure.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, the molecular formula can be calculated.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Count**:\n    *   From the di-substituted aromatic ring (C₆H₄): 4 hydrogens\n    *   From the vinyl group (-CH=CH-): 2 hydrogens\n    *   From the two methyl groups (2 x -CH₃): 6 hydrogens\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 hydrogens.**\n    This hydrogen count immediately eliminates options B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and C (C₁₁H₁₄O₂).\n\n*   **Carbon Count**:\n    *   From the benzene ring: 6 carbons\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (-**C**OO-): 1 carbon\n    *   From the vinyl group (-**C**H=**C**H-): 2 carbons\n    *   From the two methyl groups (2 x -**C**H₃): 2 carbons\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 11 carbons.**\n    This carbon count eliminates option D (C₁₂H₁₂O₂).\n\n*   **Oxygen Count**:\n    *   From the ester group (-C**O****O**-): 2 oxygens\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the counts for each element gives a final molecular formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with a structure such as methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, which would exhibit all the described spectroscopic features: a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester, a propenyl group giving rise to a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the vinyl protons, two distinct methyl signals, and no methylene groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a corrected step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nFirst, we determine the required Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) from the structural features described:\n*   A 6-membered aromatic ring has a DBE of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n*   An ester group (R-COO-R') contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which contributes 1 to the DBE.\n*   The presence of vinyl-H signals in the 1H NMR spectrum indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which contributes 1 to the DBE.\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6.**\n\nNow, we calculate the DBE for each of the given options using the formula DBE = C + 1 - (H/2):\n*   A) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6\n*   B) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n*   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6\n*   D) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n\nBased on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options B and D. The correct formula must be either A (C12H14O2) or C (C11H12O2).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify Fragments**\n\nWe use the detailed NMR data to build the molecular structure.\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical, 1,4-(para) substitution pattern. This identifies a **C6H4** fragment.\n*   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. One vinyl proton is split only by its vinyl neighbor (giving a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by its vinyl neighbor (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment is **C3H5**.\n*   **-CH3 Groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal belongs to the propenyl group just identified. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n*   **No -CH2 Groups:** This is a critical constraint. The ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-OCH2CH3) or have any other methylene groups. Therefore, the second methyl group must be either from a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). In either case, this fragment is **C2H3O2**.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n1.  Aromatic ring: **C6H4**\n2.  Propenyl group: **C3H5**\n3.  Methyl ester or acetate group: **C2H3O2**\n\n*   **Total Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe chemical formula derived from a structure that fits all the spectroscopic data is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Plausible Options and Conclude**\n\nThe derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\nLet's re-evaluate option A (C12H14O2). This formula has the correct DBE of 6. However, its composition is C11H12O2 + CH2. To form a valid structure for C12H14O2 based on the NMR fragments (e.g., by changing the methyl ester to an ethyl ester), a -CH2- group would have to be introduced. This directly contradicts the explicit constraint that there are no signals for -CH2- groups in the spectrum. No other plausible structure for C12H14O2 fits the highly specific vinyl proton splitting pattern without containing a -CH2- group.\n\nTherefore, C11H12O2 is the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided information (FTIR, aromaticity, and all details of the 1H NMR spectrum including splitting patterns and the absence of specific signals).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user wants me to identify the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on its spectral data.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Information:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core.\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) substitution pattern with electronically similar substituents or symmetry.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This strongly suggests a `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group. The H on the carbon adjacent to the ring would be a doublet (split by the other vinyl H). The other vinyl H would be a doublet of quartets (split by the first vinyl H and the three protons of the methyl group).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** This indicates two distinct methyl groups.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** Confirms the absence of any methylene (-CH2-) bridges.\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectral data, we can propose a plausible structure.\n*   **Core:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents:**\n    *   An ester group (-COO-).\n    *   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   A methyl group (-CH3).\n\nLet's combine these pieces. The ester group must be one of the substituents on the ring, and it incorporates one of the methyl groups. The other substituent is the propenyl group.\n\n**Plausible Structure:** Methyl propenylbenzoate. For example, methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n*   The aromatic ring is substituted with a `-COOCH3` group and a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n*   This structure fits all the NMR data:\n    *   Two aromatic signals (from the para-substituted ring).\n    *   Two vinyl signals with the described splitting pattern.\n    *   Two methyl signals (one from the ester, one from the propenyl group).\n    *   No -CH2- groups.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula:\n\nNow, let's determine the chemical formula for this proposed structure.\n*   **Benzene ring part:** C6H4\n*   **Ester group part:** -COOCH3 -> adds C2, H3, O2\n*   **Propenyl group part:** -CH=CH-CH3 -> adds C3, H5\n*   **Total Carbon atoms:** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O-CH3) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11 carbons.\n*   **Total Hydrogen atoms:** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from O-CH3) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Total Oxygen atoms:** 2 (from ester).\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Verifying with Degree of Unsaturation:\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n*   Benzene ring = 4 units of unsaturation.\n*   C=O bond in ester = 1 unit of unsaturation.\n*   C=C bond in vinyl group = 1 unit of unsaturation.\n*   Total = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated degree of unsaturation matches the proposed structure.\n\n### Comparing with the Options:\n\n*   A) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5) - Incorrect DoU.\n*   B) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7) - Incorrect DoU.\n*   C) C11H12O2 (DoU = 6) - Matches the analysis.\n*   D) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6) - While the DoU is correct, this formula does not match the fragments identified from the NMR data. Building a C12H14O2 molecule consistent with the NMR data (especially the absence of -CH2- groups) is not feasible.\n\nThe analysis of the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data strongly and consistently points to a molecular formula of C11H12O2.

The 1H NMR shows two signals for these aromatic protons, which often suggests a para-substitution pattern, leading to two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** Confirms the 4 protons on the di-substituted ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One methyl signal corresponds to the propenyl group mentioned above. The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group. This could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). In either case, this adds a CH3 group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out structures containing ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl groups (-CH2CH2CH3), which would show signals for -CH2- protons.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula:\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the C6H4 ring) + 3 (from the C3H5 propenyl group) + 1 (from the -COO- ester core) + 1 (from the second CH3 group) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the C6H4 ring) + 5 (from the C3H5 propenyl group) + 3 (from the second CH3 group) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the -COO- ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Comparing with Options:\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** Incorrect carbon count.\n*   **B) C11H12O2:** Matches the derived formula. Examples of isomers with this formula include ethyl cinnamate and cinnamyl acetate. However, ethyl cinnamate has a -CH2- group and cinnamyl acetate has a -CH2- group, both of which are ruled out by the NMR data. The correct structures would be isomers like *p*-propenyl methyl benzoate or *p*-propenylphenyl acetate.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** Incorrect carbon and hydrogen count.\n*   **D) C11H14O2:** Incorrect hydrogen count. A compound like 3-phenylpropyl acetate has this formula but contains -CH2- groups and lacks vinyl protons.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula among the choices is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer's Initial Analysis:**\n\nThe problem asks to identify the molecular formula of a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectral data.\n\n1.  **From the problem statement, we know:**\n    *   It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring, C6H4).\n    *   FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-).\n    *   1H NMR shows:\n        *   Two aromatic-H signals.\n        *   Two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets).\n        *   Two -CH3 signals.\n        *   No -CH2 signals.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This suggests a para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** The pattern of a doublet and a doublet of quartets is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet), and the other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One of these is the methyl group from the propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3).

For the ester group not to have a -CH2- group, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), for example, is ruled out.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure and Formula:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring fragment: C6H4.\n    *   We have a propenyl group substituent: -C3H5.\n    *   We have an ester-related substituent that also contains a methyl group. This can be either:\n        *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3, which has the formula -C2H3O2.\n        *   An acetate group: -OCOCH3, which also has the formula -C2H3O2.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the total molecular formula:\n        *   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester part) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl of ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygens: 2 (ester).\n    *   The resulting formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Proposed Action:** The logical deduction seems complete. To be certain, I will perform a search to confirm that the proposed structures (like methyl p-propenylbenzoate or p-propenylphenyl acetate) are consistent with the given data and that no other possibilities for the other formulas exist.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination:**\n\nThe initial deduction to C11H12O2 is strong. The search results provide spectra for related compounds. Let's analyze them to see if they support or contradict the conclusion.\n*   The search did not yield spectra for the exact proposed structures (methyl propenylbenzoate or propenylphenyl acetate).\n*   However, it provided spectra for similar molecules. For example, 3-phenylpropyl acetate (C11H14O2) shows the presence of -CH2- groups in its NMR spectrum, confirming that adding hydrogens to C11H12O2 would introduce these signals, which contradicts the problem statement.\n*   Spectra for methyl benzoate (C8H8O2) and other simple esters are available, but don't directly help confirm the vinyl group signals.\n*   The search on C12H14O2 and C12H12O2 did not reveal any common structures that would fit all the NMR constraints (di-substituted, propenyl group, ester, no -CH2-). For instance, many isomers of C12H14O2 contain -CH2- groups.\n\nThe core of the argument remains the logical deduction from the spectral data:\n*   **Aromatic Ring (C6H4) + Propenyl Group (C3H5) + Ester with a Methyl Group (C2H3O2) = C11H12O2.**\n*   **C11H14O2:** This formula has two more hydrogens. To add two hydrogens to C11H12O2, one would typically saturate the propenyl's double bond, creating a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3). This introduces -CH2- signals, which are explicitly absent. Thus, C11H14O2 is incorrect.\n*   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. This is directly ruled out by the \"no -CH2- signals\" constraint.\n*   **C12H12O2:** This formula has an extra C and the same number of hydrogens as C11H12O2. It is impossible to add a carbon atom without either adding hydrogens (which would change the formula), creating a forbidden -CH2- group (e.g., by making an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3), or violating another rule (e.g., adding a methyl to the ring would make it tri-substituted; adding a vinyl group to the ester, -COOCH=CH2, would create four vinyl signals instead of two).\n\nThe initial deduction is robust and withstands scrutiny. The constraints provided are very specific and point to a single molecular formula.\n\n**Convergence and Final Decision:**\n\nThe proposer's initial analysis is correct. The combination of a di-substituted benzene ring, an ester group, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and the absence of any methylene groups can only be satisfied by the molecular formula C11H12O2. The other options are systematically ruled out by the given constraints.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

This confirms the presence of two oxygen atoms in the molecule. All four possible answers have \"O2\" in their formula, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**:\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H**: A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical arrangement, such as a para (1,4) substitution, which would result in two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by one other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups**: One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH₃). The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality, indicating a methyl ester (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups**: This is a crucial constraint. It rules out substituents like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), or allyl (-CH₂CH=CH₂).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure**: Based on the analysis, the compound consists of:\n    *   A benzene ring (C₆H₄)\n    *   A propenyl group (-C₃H₅)\n    *   A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃, which contributes C₂H₃O₂)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Chemical Formula**: Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from the benzene ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 1 (from the carbonyl group) + 1 (from the methyl part of the ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from the aromatic ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group: -CH=CH-C**H₃**) + 3 (from the methyl ester group) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from the ester group)\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

This would likely contain a propyl group instead of a propenyl group, which would have -CH₂ signals.\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: Incorrect. A plausible structure would be ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, but this contains an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and is thus ruled out by the absence of -CH₂ signals.\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: Incorrect. It is difficult to construct a molecule with this formula that matches all the spectral data without including -CH₂ groups or other features that contradict the NMR data.\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: Correct. This formula perfectly matches the structure deduced from the FTIR and NMR spectra.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the following deductions can be made to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the chemical formula options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which has the formula -C₆H₄-. The presence of two signals for these aromatic protons suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which would result in two chemically distinct sets of protons.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** The absence of signals for methylene (-CH₂) groups is a critical clue. This eliminates the possibility of an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or other similar structures.\n    *   **Two –CH₃ groups:** There are two distinct signals for methyl groups. One must be part of the ester, making it a methyl ester (-COOCH₃), as this contains no -CH₂ group. The other methyl group must be part of the second substituent on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** The presence of two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) indicates a double bond in the second substituent. The splitting pattern provides more detail:\n        *   A *doublet of quartets* for one vinyl proton means it is coupled to one other vinyl proton (creating the doublet) and a methyl group (creating the quartet).\n        *   A *doublet* for the other vinyl proton means it is coupled to only the first vinyl proton.\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:** The pieces are a di-substituted benzene ring (-C₆H₄-), a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃), and a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).

This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A 6-membered aromatic ring (like benzene) has a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, which contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The 1H NMR shows signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). This C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total DoU:** The minimum DoU based on the identified functional groups is 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for Each Possible Formula:**\n    The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. This does not match the required DoU of 6.\n    *   B) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. This matches.\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. This also matches.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This does not match.\n\n    Based on the DoU, the correct formula must be either **B) C11H12O2** or **C) C12H14O2**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring (C6H4):** A di-substituted 6-membered ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals for these protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para) substitution.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The problem states there are **no signals for –CH2 groups**. An ester has the general structure R-COO-R'. If R' were an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), we would see a -CH2- signal. Since there is none, the simplest possibility for R' is a methyl group (-CH3). This gives us a **methyl ester** fragment (-COOCH3) and accounts for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n    *   **Vinyl Group & Second -CH3:** There are two vinyl protons. One is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to only one other proton. The other is a doublet of quartets (dq), meaning it's coupled to one proton (the other vinyl H) and a group of three protons (a -CH3 group). This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). This fragment accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and the second –CH3 signal.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    We have the following pieces:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring: C6H4\n    *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n    *   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n\n    Assembling these gives a structure like methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. Let's count the atoms in this complete structure:\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from -OCH3) + 3 (from propenyl) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from -OCH3) + 5 (from propenyl) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The deduced formula C11H12O2 matches option B. The other possibility with the correct DoU, C12H14O2 (Option C), contains an extra CH2 unit compared to our deduced structure. The explicit absence of –CH2 signals in the NMR spectrum rules out this option.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information from the problem statement.**\n\n1.  **Molecular Framework:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The core formula for this part is C6H4. The degree of unsaturation for the ring itself is 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n2.  **Functional Group (FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms (C, O2) and adds one degree of unsaturation due to the C=O double bond.\n3.  **Proton NMR (1H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C6H4). Having only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4-substitution). In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents, the four protons form two chemically distinct sets (an AA'BB' system), which often appears as two signals (two doublets).\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** This indicates the presence of a C=C double bond with a proton on each carbon. Let's call them Ha and Hb.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Ha) is coupled to only one other proton (Hb).\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Hb) is coupled to two different groups of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet, which must be Ha) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, which must be a -CH3 group).\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group would be the doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton would be the doublet.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n        *   One -CH3 group is already identified as part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be located elsewhere. Given the presence of an ester group, a methyl ester (-COOCH3) is a very common and plausible structure. A methyl group in this position would be a singlet, as it's not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out structures containing ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or other alkyl chains with methylene groups.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we have the following pieces:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n*   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n*   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n\nLet's combine these to form the complete molecule. The two substituents on the benzene ring are the propenyl group and the methyl ester group.\n\nThe proposed structure is: **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n      CH3\n       |\n      (O=)C-O\n       |\n      / \\\n     |   |\n    // \\\\ //\n   |     |\n    \\\\ // \\\\\n     |   |\n      \\ /\n       |\n      CH=CH-CH3\n```\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Di-substituted aromatic ring:** Yes.\n*   **Ester group:** Yes (-COOCH3).\n*   **Aromatic-H:** Yes, 4 protons in a para arrangement, giving 2 signals.\n*   **Vinyl-H:** Yes, the -CH=CH- part gives 2 signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets).\n*   **-CH3 groups:** Yes, two of them. One in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) and one in the methyl ester (-COOCH3). They are in different chemical environments, so they will give two separate signals.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** Yes, the structure contains no -CH2- groups.\n\nThe proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the chemical formula from the proposed structure.**\n\nNow, we count the atoms in the structure CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3.\n*   **Carbon (C):** 1 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from -CH=CH-) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from -COO-) + 1 (from ester CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 3 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from -CH=CH-) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from ester CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester -COO-) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C11H12O2\n*   D) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe user has provided the output from the code execution. I will now complete the reasoning process and provide the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of Code Output and Further Reasoning\n\nThe Python code calculated the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for each of the possible chemical formulas. The DBE represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n1.  **DBE from Structural Fragments:**\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, contributing 4 to the DBE.\n    *   An ester group has a C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the DBE.\n    *   The presence of vinyl-H signals indicates a C=C double bond, contributing 1 to the DBE.\n    *   **Total required DBE = 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6.**\n\n2.  **DBE from Provided Formulas (Code Output):**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DBE = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DBE = 6 (Possible)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DBE = 6 (Possible)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DBE = 7 (Incorrect)\n\nThe DBE calculation narrows down the possibilities to **B (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**.\n\n### Distinguishing Between B and C using NMR Data\n\nNow, we must use the specific fragment information from the ¹H NMR spectrum to determine the exact number of carbons and hydrogens.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄ (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens)\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The \"doublet\" and \"doublet of quartets\" pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH₃**. This fragment contains 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (1+1+3).\n*   **Methyl Groups:** There are two -CH₃ signals. One belongs to the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester. Since there are **no -CH₂ signals**, the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). It must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH₃). In either case, this second methyl group adds 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.\n*   **Ester Carbonyl:** The C=O part of the ester adds 1 carbon.\n\nLet's sum the atoms from these identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the second CH₃) + 1 (from the ester C=O) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the second CH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe molecular formula assembled from all the spectroscopic evidence is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches option B.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider why option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is incorrect. The difference between our derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is one carbon and two hydrogens (a CH₂ group). The problem statement explicitly says, \"**There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\" Therefore, option C is inconsistent with the provided data.\n\nThe only formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, we can deduce the structure and subsequently the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring and Ester:** The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`) and contains an ester group (`-COO-`). The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens, and a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 4. The ester's C=O bond adds another degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **NMR Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which has a plane of symmetry, resulting in two sets of chemically equivalent aromatic protons. This accounts for 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, d & dq):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The `CH` adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton into a doublet (d). The other vinyl `CH` is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). This group adds 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`-C3H5`) and one C=C double bond (1 DoU).\n    *   **-CH3 Groups (2 signals):** One methyl group is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other methyl group must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No -CH2 Groups:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) or have any other alkyl chain with a -CH2- unit. Therefore, the second methyl group must be either from a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure and Formula:**\n    Let's assemble the pieces: a para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`), a propenyl group (`-C3H5`), an ester group (`-COO-`), and a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The structure contains one benzene ring (4 DoU), one C=C double bond (1 DoU), and one C=O double bond (1 DoU). The total DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the formula C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   This matches perfectly. The other options either have the wrong DoU (A and D) or imply the presence of a -CH2- group (C), which is contradicted by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4. The presence of an aromatic ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O double bond in the ester accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - Six signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR - Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern with two different substituents, which would give a characteristic pair of doublets (an AA'BB' system).\n    *   **1H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic splitting pattern for a `CH3-CH=CH-` group.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet). The resulting signal is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d).\n        *   This fragment confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl groups is part of the `CH3-CH=CH-` fragment identified above. This means there must be a second, chemically distinct methyl group somewhere else in the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR - No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates many potential structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments:**\n    Based on the analysis above, the molecule must contain the following pieces:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n    *   An ester group: `-COO-`\n    *   A propenyl group: `CH3-CH=CH-` (which has a formula of `C3H5` when attached to another group)\n    *   A methyl group: `-CH3`\n\n3.  **Construct a Plausible Structure and Determine its Formula:**\n    Let's assemble these fragments. There are two primary ways they can be connected that are consistent with the data:\n\n    *   **Structure A:** The ester is a methyl ester, and the propenyl group is attached to the ring.\n        *   `CH3-CH=CH-`[ring]`-COO-CH3` (e.g., Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate)\n    *   **Structure B:** The ester is a phenyl ester (specifically, a tolyl ester), and the rest of the molecule forms the acyl group.\n        *   `CH3-CH=CH-CO-O-`[ring]`-CH3` (e.g., 4-methylphenyl but-2-enoate or p-tolyl crotonate)\n\n    Now, let's determine the chemical formula for these structures.\n    *   **For Structure A:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester CH3) = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester CH3) = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 (ester)\n        *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n    *   **For Structure B:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 3 (alkene chain) + 1 (ester C=O) + 6 (ring) + 1 (ring CH3) = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 5 (alkene chain) + 4 (ring) + 3 (ring CH3) = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 (ester)\n        *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n    Both plausible structures that fit all the spectroscopic data have the same chemical formula: **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) C12H14O2:** Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) = 6. This formula is C11H12O2 + CH2. To make a valid structure, a -CH2- group would need to be added, which is explicitly contradicted by the NMR data.\n    *   **B) C11H12O2:** DBE = 6. This matches the formula derived from the structural fragments and is consistent with all the data (aromatic ring=4, C=O=1, C=C=1).\n    *   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 5. This is inconsistent. It lacks a degree of unsaturation, meaning it couldn't have the C=C vinyl group required by the NMR data.\n    *   **D) C12H12O2:** DBE = 7. This is inconsistent. It has an extra degree of unsaturation (an extra ring or double bond) that is not supported by the data.\n\nBased on this systematic analysis, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided information is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Deduce the structural fragments of the unknown compound from the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data.\n    2.  Assemble these fragments into a complete, plausible chemical structure that satisfies all the given constraints (di-substituted aromatic, ester, specific NMR signals, no –CH2– groups).\n    3.  Calculate the molecular formula of the deduced structure and match it with the given options.\n\n*   **Action (Execution of Plan):**\n\n    1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n        *   **FTIR:** An ester group (–COO–) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the formula options.\n        *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core. The presence of only two aromatic-H signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is C6H4.\n        *   **Vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton coupled to both another vinyl proton and a methyl group gives the doublet of quartets. This fragment is C3H5.\n        *   **Two –CH3 signals:** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (–CH=CH–**CH3**). The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **No –CH2– signals:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3) or a propanoate (–CH2COO–), for example.\n\n    2.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n        *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n        *   One substituent is the propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n        *   The other substituent must be an ester containing a methyl group, with no methylene (–CH2–) groups. This leaves two possibilities for this substituent:\n            *   An acetate group: –O–CO–CH3\n            *   A methoxycarbonyl group (methyl ester): –COO–CH3\n\n    3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n        *   **Possibility 1:** The molecule is 4-propenylphenyl acetate.\n            *   Fragments: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (acetate group)\n            *   Total Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n            *   Total Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n            *   Total Oxygens: 2\n            *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n        *   **Possibility 2:** The molecule is methyl 4-propenylbenzoate.\n            *   Fragments: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (methoxycarbonyl group)\n            *   Total Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n            *   Total Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n            *   Total Oxygens: 2\n            *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n    Both plausible structures that fit all the spectroscopic data have the same molecular formula: C11H12O2. This formula corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present. This functional group contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which corresponds to a C₆H₄ fragment.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The presence of two signals for the four aromatic protons suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which results in a symmetrical structure.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** There are two hydrogens on a carbon-carbon double bond. The splitting patterns are key:\n        *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** indicates a hydrogen that is split by one adjacent hydrogen (doublet) and by a group of three hydrogens, like a methyl group (quartet).\n        *   A **doublet (d)** indicates a hydrogen that is split by only one adjacent hydrogen.\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group appears as a doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl hydrogen appears as a doublet.\n    *   **-CH₃ Groups (2 signals):** There are two distinct methyl groups. One belongs to the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester group (e.g., a methyl ester or an acetate).\n    *   **No -CH₂ Groups:** The absence of any methylene (-CH₂) signals is a crucial constraint for the final structure.\n\n### 2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments\n\nBased on the analysis, we can identify the following pieces of the molecule:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n2.  **Substituent 1 (from vinyl and one CH₃ signal):** A propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH₃. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n3.  **Substituent 2 (from FTIR and the second CH₃ signal):** An ester group containing a methyl group. To avoid having a -CH₂- group, this must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Chemical Formula\n\nNow, we add up the atoms from all the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches the spectral data perfectly. It accounts for the di-substituted aromatic ring, the ester group, the propenyl group with its specific NMR splitting pattern, two distinct methyl groups, and the absence of any methylene groups. Comparing this to the given options, it corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe analysis of the provided spectroscopic data allows for a step-by-step deduction of the unknown compound's structure and, consequently, its chemical formula.\n\n### Spectroscopic Data Analysis:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with two signals corresponding to the four aromatic hydrogens.\n\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** The presence of an ester functional group (-COO-) is confirmed. This adds two oxygen atoms to the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the C6H4 ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The doublet arises from one vinyl proton being split by the other vinyl proton. The doublet of quartets arises from the second vinyl proton being split by both the first vinyl proton and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3), as that would produce a –CH2 signal.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Structure:\n\nBased on the data, the molecule is composed of the following fragments:\n*   A C6H4 (aromatic ring) fragment.\n*   A -COO- (ester) fragment.\n*   A -CH=CH-CH3 (propenyl) fragment, which accounts for the vinyl and one methyl signal.\n*   A -CH3 (methyl) fragment, which must be part of the ester group.\n\nTo satisfy the \"no –CH2 groups\" rule, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-O-CO-CH3). Both arrangements lead to the same molecular formula.\n\nLet's calculate the formula by summing the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 1 (from the carbonyl C in the ester) + 1 (from the methyl C in the ester) + 3 (from the propenyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 3 (from the ester's methyl group) + 5 (from the propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This formula is consistent with known isomers like ethyl cinnamate and methyl isoeugenol, which fit the structural features deduced from the spectra.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the unknown compound can be determined by systematically analyzing each piece of data.\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group indicates the molecule contains a -COO- functional group, which accounts for two oxygen atoms. All the proposed formulas (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this, as they each contain two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The proton NMR spectrum provides the most detailed information for identifying the molecular structure's components and, subsequently, its formula.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm) correspond to the protons on a di-substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring with two substituents has the formula C₆H₄, meaning there are 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals for vinyl protons indicate the presence of a -CH=CH- group. The splitting patterns are key: one signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets for a vinyl proton strongly suggests it is coupled to another vinyl proton (giving the doublet) and to a methyl (-CH₃) group (giving the quartet). This points to a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) as a fragment. This fragment contains 2 vinyl hydrogens.\n    *   **Methyl Protons**: The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One of these is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be located elsewhere in the molecule. In total, these two methyl groups account for 2 x 3 = 6 hydrogens.\n    *   **Absence of -CH₂ Groups**: The lack of any signals corresponding to methylene (-CH₂) groups is a crucial constraint on the possible structure.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, the molecular formula can be calculated.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Count**:\n    *   From the di-substituted aromatic ring (C₆H₄): 4 hydrogens\n    *   From the vinyl group (-CH=CH-): 2 hydrogens\n    *   From the two methyl groups (2 x -CH₃): 6 hydrogens\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 hydrogens.**\n    This hydrogen count immediately eliminates options B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and C (C₁₁H₁₄O₂).\n\n*   **Carbon Count**:\n    *   From the benzene ring: 6 carbons\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (-**C**OO-): 1 carbon\n    *   From the vinyl group (-**C**H=**C**H-): 2 carbons\n    *   From the two methyl groups (2 x -**C**H₃): 2 carbons\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 11 carbons.**\n    This carbon count eliminates option D (C₁₂H₁₂O₂).\n\n*   **Oxygen Count**:\n    *   From the ester group (-C**O****O**-): 2 oxygens\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the counts for each element gives a final molecular formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with a structure such as methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, which would exhibit all the described spectroscopic features: a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester, a propenyl group giving rise to a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the vinyl protons, two distinct methyl signals, and no methylene groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a corrected step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nFirst, we determine the required Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) from the structural features described:\n*   A 6-membered aromatic ring has a DBE of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n*   An ester group (R-COO-R') contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which contributes 1 to the DBE.\n*   The presence of vinyl-H signals in the 1H NMR spectrum indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which contributes 1 to the DBE.\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6.**\n\nNow, we calculate the DBE for each of the given options using the formula DBE = C + 1 - (H/2):\n*   A) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6\n*   B) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n*   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6\n*   D) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n\nBased on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options B and D. The correct formula must be either A (C12H14O2) or C (C11H12O2).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify Fragments**\n\nWe use the detailed NMR data to build the molecular structure.\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical, 1,4-(para) substitution pattern. This identifies a **C6H4** fragment.\n*   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. One vinyl proton is split only by its vinyl neighbor (giving a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by its vinyl neighbor (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment is **C3H5**.\n*   **-CH3 Groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal belongs to the propenyl group just identified. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n*   **No -CH2 Groups:** This is a critical constraint. The ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-OCH2CH3) or have any other methylene groups. Therefore, the second methyl group must be either from a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). In either case, this fragment is **C2H3O2**.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n1.  Aromatic ring: **C6H4**\n2.  Propenyl group: **C3H5**\n3.  Methyl ester or acetate group: **C2H3O2**\n\n*   **Total Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe chemical formula derived from a structure that fits all the spectroscopic data is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Plausible Options and Conclude**\n\nThe derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\nLet's re-evaluate option A (C12H14O2). This formula has the correct DBE of 6. However, its composition is C11H12O2 + CH2. To form a valid structure for C12H14O2 based on the NMR fragments (e.g., by changing the methyl ester to an ethyl ester), a -CH2- group would have to be introduced. This directly contradicts the explicit constraint that there are no signals for -CH2- groups in the spectrum. No other plausible structure for C12H14O2 fits the highly specific vinyl proton splitting pattern without containing a -CH2- group.\n\nTherefore, C11H12O2 is the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided information (FTIR, aromaticity, and all details of the 1H NMR spectrum including splitting patterns and the absence of specific signals).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user wants me to identify the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on its spectral data.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Information:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core.\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) substitution pattern with electronically similar substituents or symmetry.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This strongly suggests a `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group. The H on the carbon adjacent to the ring would be a doublet (split by the other vinyl H). The other vinyl H would be a doublet of quartets (split by the first vinyl H and the three protons of the methyl group).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** This indicates two distinct methyl groups.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** Confirms the absence of any methylene (-CH2-) bridges.\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectral data, we can propose a plausible structure.\n*   **Core:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents:**\n    *   An ester group (-COO-).\n    *   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   A methyl group (-CH3).\n\nLet's combine these pieces. The ester group must be one of the substituents on the ring, and it incorporates one of the methyl groups. The other substituent is the propenyl group.\n\n**Plausible Structure:** Methyl propenylbenzoate. For example, methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n*   The aromatic ring is substituted with a `-COOCH3` group and a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n*   This structure fits all the NMR data:\n    *   Two aromatic signals (from the para-substituted ring).\n    *   Two vinyl signals with the described splitting pattern.\n    *   Two methyl signals (one from the ester, one from the propenyl group).\n    *   No -CH2- groups.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula:\n\nNow, let's determine the chemical formula for this proposed structure.\n*   **Benzene ring part:** C6H4\n*   **Ester group part:** -COOCH3 -> adds C2, H3, O2\n*   **Propenyl group part:** -CH=CH-CH3 -> adds C3, H5\n*   **Total Carbon atoms:** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O-CH3) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11 carbons.\n*   **Total Hydrogen atoms:** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from O-CH3) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Total Oxygen atoms:** 2 (from ester).\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Verifying with Degree of Unsaturation:\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n*   Benzene ring = 4 units of unsaturation.\n*   C=O bond in ester = 1 unit of unsaturation.\n*   C=C bond in vinyl group = 1 unit of unsaturation.\n*   Total = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated degree of unsaturation matches the proposed structure.\n\n### Comparing with the Options:\n\n*   A) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5) - Incorrect DoU.\n*   B) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7) - Incorrect DoU.\n*   C) C11H12O2 (DoU = 6) - Matches the analysis.\n*   D) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6) - While the DoU is correct, this formula does not match the fragments identified from the NMR data. Building a C12H14O2 molecule consistent with the NMR data (especially the absence of -CH2- groups) is not feasible.\n\nThe analysis of the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data strongly and consistently points to a molecular formula of C11H12O2. This is supported by constructing a plausible chemical structure that fits all the spectral details.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script successfully determined the chemical formula by breaking down the molecule into its constituent fragments based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring contributes a C6H4 core.\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms an ester group, which contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl carbon (-COO-).\n3.  **NMR Signals:**\n    *   The vinyl and methyl signals are consistent with a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which adds C3H5.\n    *   The second methyl signal, with the constraint of no -CH2- groups, must be the methyl part of a methyl ester (-COOCH3), adding CH3.\n4.  **Total Formula:** Summing these fragments (C6H4 + C3H5 + COOCH3) gives a total of 11 carbons (6+3+1+1), 12 hydrogens (4+5+3), and 2 oxygens.\n\nThe final calculated formula is C11H12O2, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe initial analysis of the spectroscopic data strongly points towards the molecular formula C11H12O2. Let's break down the reasoning based on the provided information and confirm it with the search results.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, having a base formula of C6H4. The 1H NMR shows two signals for these aromatic protons, which often suggests a para-substitution pattern, leading to two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** Confirms the 4 protons on the di-substituted ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One methyl signal corresponds to the propenyl group mentioned above. The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group. This could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). In either case, this adds a CH3 group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out structures containing ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl groups (-CH2CH2CH3), which would show signals for -CH2- protons.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula:\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the C6H4 ring) + 3 (from the C3H5 propenyl group) + 1 (from the -COO- ester core) + 1 (from the second CH3 group) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the C6H4 ring) + 5 (from the C3H5 propenyl group) + 3 (from the second CH3 group) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the -COO- ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Comparing with Options:\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** Incorrect carbon count.\n*   **B) C11H12O2:** Matches the derived formula. Examples of isomers with this formula include ethyl cinnamate and cinnamyl acetate. However, ethyl cinnamate has a -CH2- group and cinnamyl acetate has a -CH2- group, both of which are ruled out by the NMR data. The correct structures would be isomers like *p*-propenyl methyl benzoate or *p*-propenylphenyl acetate.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** Incorrect carbon and hydrogen count.\n*   **D) C11H14O2:** Incorrect hydrogen count. A compound like 3-phenylpropyl acetate has this formula but contains -CH2- groups and lacks vinyl protons.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula among the choices is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer's Initial Analysis:**\n\nThe problem asks to identify the molecular formula of a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectral data.\n\n1.  **From the problem statement, we know:**\n    *   It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring, C6H4).\n    *   FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-).\n    *   1H NMR shows:\n        *   Two aromatic-H signals.\n        *   Two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets).\n        *   Two -CH3 signals.\n        *   No -CH2 signals.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This suggests a para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** The pattern of a doublet and a doublet of quartets is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet), and the other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One of these is the methyl group from the propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3). The other must be part of the ester functionality, as there are no other places for it.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester group not to have a -CH2- group, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), for example, is ruled out.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure and Formula:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring fragment: C6H4.\n    *   We have a propenyl group substituent: -C3H5.\n    *   We have an ester-related substituent that also contains a methyl group. This can be either:\n        *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3, which has the formula -C2H3O2.\n        *   An acetate group: -OCOCH3, which also has the formula -C2H3O2.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the total molecular formula:\n        *   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester part) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl of ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygens: 2 (ester).\n    *   The resulting formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Proposed Action:** The logical deduction seems complete. To be certain, I will perform a search to confirm that the proposed structures (like methyl p-propenylbenzoate or p-propenylphenyl acetate) are consistent with the given data and that no other possibilities for the other formulas exist.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination:**\n\nThe initial deduction to C11H12O2 is strong. The search results provide spectra for related compounds. Let's analyze them to see if they support or contradict the conclusion.\n*   The search did not yield spectra for the exact proposed structures (methyl propenylbenzoate or propenylphenyl acetate).\n*   However, it provided spectra for similar molecules. For example, 3-phenylpropyl acetate (C11H14O2) shows the presence of -CH2- groups in its NMR spectrum, confirming that adding hydrogens to C11H12O2 would introduce these signals, which contradicts the problem statement.\n*   Spectra for methyl benzoate (C8H8O2) and other simple esters are available, but don't directly help confirm the vinyl group signals.\n*   The search on C12H14O2 and C12H12O2 did not reveal any common structures that would fit all the NMR constraints (di-substituted, propenyl group, ester, no -CH2-). For instance, many isomers of C12H14O2 contain -CH2- groups.\n\nThe core of the argument remains the logical deduction from the spectral data:\n*   **Aromatic Ring (C6H4) + Propenyl Group (C3H5) + Ester with a Methyl Group (C2H3O2) = C11H12O2.**\n*   **C11H14O2:** This formula has two more hydrogens. To add two hydrogens to C11H12O2, one would typically saturate the propenyl's double bond, creating a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3). This introduces -CH2- signals, which are explicitly absent. Thus, C11H14O2 is incorrect.\n*   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. This is directly ruled out by the \"no -CH2- signals\" constraint.\n*   **C12H12O2:** This formula has an extra C and the same number of hydrogens as C11H12O2. It is impossible to add a carbon atom without either adding hydrogens (which would change the formula), creating a forbidden -CH2- group (e.g., by making an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3), or violating another rule (e.g., adding a methyl to the ring would make it tri-substituted; adding a vinyl group to the ester, -COOCH=CH2, would create four vinyl signals instead of two).\n\nThe initial deduction is robust and withstands scrutiny. The constraints provided are very specific and point to a single molecular formula.\n\n**Convergence and Final Decision:**\n\nThe proposer's initial analysis is correct. The combination of a di-substituted benzene ring, an ester group, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and the absence of any methylene groups can only be satisfied by the molecular formula C11H12O2. The other options are systematically ruled out by the given constraints.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
