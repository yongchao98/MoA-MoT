The hydroxyl group is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine. This reaction protects the alcohol as a TBDMS ether, which is stable under the basic conditions of the subsequent steps. The product is (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one (Product 1).\n\n**Step 2: Tandem Conjugate Addition and Alkylation**\nProduct 1, an α,β-unsaturated ketone, is treated with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent. Gilman reagents are known to perform 1,4-conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated systems. The phenyl group (Ph) adds to the C3 position. Stereochemically, the addition occurs anti to the bulky TBDMS ether at C4. Assuming the TBDMS group is in a stable equatorial position (\"down\"), the phenyl group will add from the opposite (axial, \"up\") face. This establishes a *trans* relationship between the C4 and C3 substituents, resulting in a (3R, 4S) configuration.\n\nThis addition forms a lithium enolate intermediate. This enolate is then \"trapped\" by the addition of benzyl bromide (BnBr). The enolate, being a strong nucleophile, attacks the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, adding the benzyl group to the C2 position. The stereochemistry of this alkylation is controlled by the adjacent, bulky axial phenyl group at C3, which directs the incoming benzyl group to the opposite face. This results in the benzyl group adding to the equatorial position (\"down\"). This leads to a (2S) configuration.\n\nThus, Product 2 is (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Second Alkylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I). LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base used to form enolates. In an unsymmetrical ketone like Product 2, LDA typically deprotonates the less substituted α-carbon to form the kinetic enolate. The α-carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is trisubstituted (with H, benzyl, and phenyl groups nearby), while C6 is disubstituted (with two protons). Therefore, LDA will selectively deprotonate at C6.\n\nThe resulting enolate at C6 then attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group. The stereochemistry of this methylation is influenced by the existing bulky substituents on the other side of the ring. The large axial phenyl group at C3 will direct the methyl group to add from the opposite face, leading to an axial attack from the \"down\" side. This results in a (6S) configuration.\n\nSo, Product 3 is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nFinally, Product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl. This is a standard acidic workup condition used to cleave TBDMS ethers, regenerating the hydroxyl group. This step does not affect the stereocenters on the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe final product, Product 4, is therefore **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the established principles of stereocontrol in conjugate additions and enolate alkylations, the structure of the final product matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n(S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine. The TBSCl protects the hydroxyl group as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether. Triethylamine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl formed during the reaction. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon remains (S).\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate addition and α-alkylation**\nProduct 1 undergoes a 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition) with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi). The phenyl group (Ph) acts as a soft nucleophile and adds to the C3 position of the α,β-unsaturated ketone. Stereochemically, the incoming phenyl group will add to the face opposite the bulky TBSO group at C4. This results in a *trans* relationship between the C4-OTBS and the new C3-Ph group. Given that C4 is (S), the addition of the phenyl group leads to an (R) configuration at C3. This reaction forms a lithium enolate intermediate, which is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide (BnBr). The benzyl group adds to the α-carbon (C2). To achieve the most thermodynamically stable product, the bulky substituents will prefer equatorial positions. This leads to the benzyl group adding *cis* to the C4-OTBS group and *trans* to the C3-phenyl group.\n*   **Product 2:** (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Second α-alkylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane. LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base that forms the kinetic enolate. It will deprotonate the ketone at the less substituted α-carbon, which is C6. The resulting enolate then reacts with iodomethane, adding a methyl group to the C6 position. For maximum stability, the methyl group will add to the equatorial position. This stereochemical outcome results in an (S) configuration at the C6 carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nProduct 3 is treated with aqueous HCl. The acidic conditions cleave the TBS ether, regenerating the hydroxyl group (-OH). This deprotection step does not affect the stereocenters created in the previous steps.\n*   **Product 4:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material: (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one**\n\n*   This is a six-membered ring containing a ketone (C1), a double bond (C2-C3), and a hydroxyl group at a stereocenter (C4).\n*   To determine the orientation of the hydroxyl group, we assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities at C4:\n    1.  -OH\n    2.  -C3=C2-\n    3.  -C5H2-\n    4.  -H\n*   For the configuration to be (S), the hydroxyl group must be on a dash (pointing down). If it were on a wedge, the configuration would be (R).\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** The alcohol at C4 is protected as a tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether (-OTBS). The reaction does not affect the stereocenter.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The bulky -OTBS group is on a dash.\n\n**Step 2: Tandem conjugate addition and alkylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), 2. Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a one-pot sequence.\n    1.  **Conjugate Addition:** The Gilman reagent (Ph2CuLi) is a soft nucleophile that performs a 1,4-conjugate addition to the α,β-unsaturated ketone. The phenyl anion (Ph-) attacks the β-carbon (C3). The bulky OTBS group at C4 is on the bottom face (dash), so the phenyl group will attack from the less sterically hindered top face. This means the phenyl group adds to C3 on a **wedge**. This addition creates a lithium enolate intermediate.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The benzyl group (Bn) adds to the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this step is crucial. The newly introduced phenyl group at the adjacent C3 position is on a wedge. While steric hindrance would normally favor the incoming benzyl group to add from the opposite face (dash), certain reaction conditions (especially with lithium enolates) can lead to a syn-addition, possibly directed by chelation. To match the provided options, we must assume a syn-alkylation occurs. Therefore, the benzyl group also adds from the top face, on a **wedge**.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting cyclohexanone has the following stereochemistry:\n    *   C4: -OTBS (dash) -> (S) configuration (from starting material)\n    *   C3: -Ph (wedge) -> (R) configuration\n    *   C2: -Bn (wedge) -> (S) configuration\n    *   The stereochemistry of Product 2 is (2S, 3R, 4S).\n\n**Step 3: Kinetic enolate formation and methylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, 2. Iodomethane (CH3I).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base. At low temperatures (-78 °C), it selectively removes the most accessible (kinetically favored) α-proton. The ketone has two α-positions: C2 and C6. C2 is heavily substituted (bearing a benzyl group and adjacent to a phenyl-substituted carbon). C6 is much less hindered. Therefore, LDA deprotonates at C6 to form the kinetic enolate, with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group to C6. The alkylation of cyclohexanone enolates generally proceeds to place the new substituent in the more stable equatorial position.\n*   **Product 3:** A methyl group is added to C6. To determine its stereochemistry, we consider the most stable chair conformation of the ring. The bulky substituents at C2, C3, and C4 will dictate the conformation. The most stable arrangement places the C2-Bn and C4-OTBS groups equatorially, forcing the C3-Ph group to be axial. In this conformation, an equatorial position at C6 corresponds to a **dash**. A methyl group on a dash at C6 results in an **(S)** configuration.\n*   The stereochemistry of Product 3 is **(2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** The acidic aqueous workup cleaves the silyl ether (OTBS) protecting group, regenerating the hydroxyl (-OH) group at C4. This reaction does not alter any of the stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexanone with four stereocenters.\n    *   Name: **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect structure and functional groups.\n*   B) Incorrect site of methylation (C2 instead of C6) and incorrect stereochemistry.\n*   C) Incorrect site of methylation (C2 instead of C6).\n*   D) **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**. This matches our derived structure and stereochemistry perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. This is a six-membered ring containing a ketone, a double bond, and a hydroxyl group. The stereochemistry at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (C4) is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard protection reaction for an alcohol. The hydroxyl group at C4 acts as a nucleophile and attacks the silicon atom of TBSCl. Triethylamine is a non-nucleophilic base that neutralizes the HCl byproduct. The stereochemistry at C4 is preserved.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. For stereochemical analysis, we can define the side of the ring with the bulky -OTBS group as the \"up\" face.\n\n**Step 2: Tandem Conjugate Addition and Alkylation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ph2CuLi (lithium diphenylcuprate, a Gilman reagent) at low temperature. 2. Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-part reaction occurring in one pot.\n    1.  **Conjugate Addition:** The Gilman reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile (Ph-), which performs a 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition). The phenyl group attacks the β-carbon (C3) of the enone system. Stereochemically, the nucleophile adds from the face opposite to the bulky -OTBS group at C4. Since the -OTBS group is \"up\", the phenyl group adds from the \"down\" face. This creates a new stereocenter at C3, and the substituents at C3 and C4 are *trans* to each other. This addition generates a lithium enolate intermediate with the double bond between C1 and C2.\n    2.  **Enolate Trapping:** The benzyl bromide is an electrophile that is attacked by the nucleophilic enolate. The alkylation occurs at the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this step is controlled by the substituent at C3. The phenyl group at C3 is on the \"down\" face and sterically hinders the approach of the electrophile from that side. Therefore, the benzyl group adds from the \"up\" face.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting product is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohexan-1-one. The relative stereochemistry is: C4-OTBS (up), C3-Ph (down), and C2-Bn (up). Based on the starting material C4 being (S), the absolute configurations of the new centers are C3-(R) and C2-(S).\n\n**Step 3: Kinetic Alkylation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) at low temperature. 2. Iodomethane (CH3I).\n*   **Reaction:** This is another enolate formation followed by alkylation.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky base. At low temperatures, it selectively deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon to form the kinetic enolate. In Product 2, the α-carbons are C2 (tertiary, very hindered) and C6 (secondary, less hindered). LDA will deprotonate C6, forming the enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n    2.  **Methylation:** The enolate attacks iodomethane to add a methyl group at C6. The stereochemical outcome is determined by chelation control. The lithium cation of the enolate can coordinate with both the enolate oxygen at C1 and the ether oxygen of the -OTBS group at C4. This forms a rigid chelate on the \"up\" face of the ring. This complex directs the electrophile (CH3I) to attack from the same \"up\" face.\n*   **Product 3:** The methyl group is added to the \"up\" face at C6. The resulting product is 2-benzyl-6-methyl-3-phenyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohexan-1-one. The new stereocenter at C6 has the (S) configuration. The overall stereochemistry is (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S).\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** The acidic conditions cleave the silyl ether (TBS group), regenerating the hydroxyl group at C4. This deprotection step does not affect the stereochemistry of any of the chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product, Product 4, has the following structure and stereochemistry:\n*   A cyclohexanone ring.\n*   A benzyl group at C2.\n*   A phenyl group at C3.\n*   A hydroxyl group at C4.\n*   A methyl group at C6.\n*   The absolute stereochemistry is (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S).\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n*   **A) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one:** This matches our derived structure and stereochemistry.\n*   **B) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. Methylation occurs at C6, not C2.\n*   **C) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol:** Incorrect structure.\n*   **D) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. Methylation occurs at C6, not C2, and the stereochemistry at C3 is incorrect.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis to determine the structure of the final product, 4.\n\n**Starting Material: (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one**\n\n*   This is a six-membered ring containing a ketone at C1, a double bond between C2 and C3, and a hydroxyl group at C4.\n*   The stereocenter at C4 has the (S) configuration. For drawing purposes, we can represent the -OH group with a wedge, assuming standard ring orientation.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard protection reaction for an alcohol. The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C4 is converted into a bulky silyl ether (-OTBS). Triethylamine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The stereochemistry at C4 is retained. The bulky TBS group will be crucial for directing the stereochemistry of the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi) at low temperature, 2. Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Part 1 (Ph2CuLi):** This is a Gilman reagent, which performs a 1,4-conjugate addition (or Michael addition) to the α,β-unsaturated ketone. The phenyl anion (Ph-) acts as the nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon (C3).\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The addition is stereoselective. The very bulky TBSO- group at C4 (wedge) will block the top face of the ring, forcing the incoming phenyl group to attack from the opposite (bottom) face. This results in the phenyl group being *trans* to the TBSO group. So, the Ph group will be on a dash.\n    *   This creates a new stereocenter at C3. With the C4-OTBS group being (S, wedge), the C3-Ph group (dash) will have the (R) configuration.\n    *   This reaction forms a lithium enolate intermediate, with the negative charge delocalized between the C1 oxygen and the C2 carbon.\n*   **Reaction Part 2 (BnBr):** The enolate formed in the first part is a nucleophile and is trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. This is a C-alkylation reaction at the α-carbon (C2).\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry of this alkylation is controlled by the adjacent substituent at C3. The benzyl group will approach from the face *anti* (opposite) to the bulky phenyl group at C3. Since the phenyl group is on a dash, the benzyl group will add from the top face (wedge).\n    *   This creates another stereocenter at C2. With the C3-Ph group being (R, dash), the C2-Bn group (wedge) will have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting structure is (2S, 3R, 4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I) at low temperature.\n*   **Reaction:** LDA is a strong, sterically hindered, non-nucleophilic base. It is used to form the *kinetic* enolate of a ketone.\n    *   **Regiochemistry:** The ketone (Product 2) has two α-carbons with protons: C2 and C6. The proton at C2 is highly sterically hindered by the adjacent benzyl and phenyl groups. The protons at C6 are much more accessible. LDA will preferentially deprotonate the less hindered position, C6.\n    *   The resulting kinetic enolate is formed across C1 and C6.\n    *   **Alkylation:** This enolate then reacts with iodomethane, adding a methyl group to C6.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry of the methylation at C6 is controlled by the existing bulky groups on the ring. To minimize steric interactions, the substituents at C2, C3, and C4 will adopt equatorial positions in the most stable chair-like conformation. The incoming methyl group will attack from the less hindered face. The bulky equatorial benzyl group at C2 will direct the methyl group to attack from the opposite face, which corresponds to an axial attack. This places the methyl group on a dash.\n    *   This creates the final stereocenter at C6. The axial methyl group (dash) results in an (S) configuration at C6.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the deprotection step. The acid cleaves the silyl ether bond, converting the TBSO- group back into a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Product 4:** This reaction does not typically affect the other stereocenters under mild conditions. The final product is (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived structure and name with the given options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol: Incorrect molecular structure.\n*   B) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: This perfectly matches our derived product.\n*   C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: Incorrect regiochemistry of methylation (C2 instead of C6) and incorrect stereochemistry at C3.\n*   D) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: Incorrect regiochemistry of methylation (C2 instead of C6) and incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\nThe correct final product is described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. This is a six-membered ring containing a ketone (C1), a double bond (C2-C3), and a hydroxyl group (C4). The (S) stereochemistry at C4 dictates that the -OH group is on a dashed bond (pointing away from the viewer in a standard 2D representation).\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard protection reaction for an alcohol. The hydroxyl group at C4 attacks the silicon atom of TBSCl, and the triethylamine base neutralizes the HCl byproduct. The -OH group is converted into a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether (-OTBS). The stereochemistry at C4 is retained.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The -OTBS group is on a dashed bond.\n\n**Step 2: Tandem conjugate addition and α-alkylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent. 2. Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction 1 (Conjugate Addition):** Gilman reagents perform 1,4-conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The nucleophilic phenyl group (\"Ph-\") attacks the β-carbon (C3). The stereochemical outcome is controlled by the bulky -OTBS group at C4. Since the -OTBS group is on the α-face (dashed), it directs the incoming phenyl group to the opposite β-face (wedged). This establishes the relative stereochemistry between C3 and C4 as *trans*. The resulting stereocenter at C3 is (R). This reaction generates a lithium enolate intermediate with the double bond between C1 and C2.\n*   **Reaction 2 (α-Alkylation):** The enolate intermediate is a nucleophile and is trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The enolate attacks the benzyl group, which adds to the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this addition is controlled by the newly introduced bulky phenyl group at C3. Since the phenyl group is on the β-face (wedged), it directs the incoming benzyl group to the opposite α-face (dashed). This establishes the relative stereochemistry between C2 and C3 as *trans*. The resulting stereocenter at C2 is (R).\n*   **Product 2:** (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Second α-alkylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I) at low temperature.\n*   **Reaction:** LDA is a strong, bulky base used to form enolates. There are two acidic α-protons: one at C2 and two at C6.\n    *   **Kinetic vs. Thermodynamic Control:** LDA at low temperature typically deprotonates the less sterically hindered position to form the *kinetic enolate*. In this case, that would be C6. However, this pathway does not lead to any of the given options.\n    *   Alternatively, deprotonation at the more substituted C2 position would form the more stable *thermodynamic enolate*. This is sterically hindered but results in a more substituted double bond in the enolate. Given the provided options, we must assume that the reaction conditions allow for the formation of the thermodynamic enolate, which is then trapped by iodomethane.\n*   **Alkylation:** The thermodynamic enolate attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group to C2. C2 already has a benzyl group on the α-face (dashed). The incoming methyl group will add from the less hindered, opposite β-face (wedged). This creates a quaternary stereocenter at C2.\n*   **Stereochemistry of C2:** The priorities are C1 > C3 > Benzyl > Methyl. With the benzyl group dashed and the methyl group wedged, the configuration at C2 is (R).\n*   **Product 3:** (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-2-methyl-3-phenyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** The acidic conditions cleave the silyl ether bond, removing the TBS protecting group and regenerating the hydroxyl group (-OH) at C4.

To determine the stereochemistry, we use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. For the stereocenter at C4 to be (S), the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be in the α position (pointing down or back).\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group is a nucleophile that attacks the silicon atom of TBSCl. This is a standard protection reaction for alcohols. The bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) group is attached to the oxygen. Triethylamine acts as a non-nucleophilic base to neutralize the HCl byproduct. The stereochemistry at C4 is retained.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The TBSO- group is in the α position.\n\n**Step 2: Tandem 1,4-conjugate addition and enolate alkylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Part 1 (Conjugate Addition):** Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is excellent for 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition) to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The phenyl nucleophile (Ph-) will add to the β-carbon (C3) of the enone system. The stereochemistry of this addition is controlled by the existing stereocenter at C4. The bulky TBSO- group is in the α position. To minimize steric hindrance, the phenyl group will attack from the opposite face, which is the β face (anti-addition).\n    *   Addition of Ph to the β face at C3 creates a new stereocenter. With Ph(β) and H(α), and priorities Ph > C4 > C2 > H, the configuration at C3 is (R).\n    *   So far, we have a (3R, 4S) intermediate.\n*   **Reaction Part 2 (Enolate Alkylation):** The conjugate addition forms a lithium enolate intermediate at C1-C2. This enolate is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The stereochemistry of this alkylation at C2 is directed by the newly introduced bulky phenyl group at C3(β). While anti-addition is generally favored sterically, leading to the benzyl group adding to the α face (giving a 2R configuration), this does not lead to any of the options. Let's consider the path that leads to the given options. For option A, a (2S) configuration is required. This means the benzyl group must add to the β face, *syn* to the phenyl group. While sterically less favorable, this can sometimes occur due to conformational effects of the enolate. Assuming this *syn*-addition occurs:\n    *   Addition of the benzyl group to the β face at C2 creates a new stereocenter. With Bn(β) and H(α), and priorities C1 > C3 > Bn > H, the configuration at C2 is (S).\n*   **Product 2:** (2S, 3R, 4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Second alkylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I) at low temperature.\n*   **Reaction (Enolate Formation):** LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base. At low temperatures, it selectively removes the most accessible proton to form the kinetic enolate. Product 2 has two types of α-protons: one at C2 (tertiary, attached to a benzyl group, and adjacent to a phenyl group, making it very hindered) and two at C6 (secondary, much less hindered). LDA will deprotonate at the less hindered C6 position.\n*   **Reaction (Alkylation):** The resulting kinetic enolate at C1-C6 reacts with iodomethane, adding a methyl group to C6. We need to determine the stereochemistry of this addition.\n    *   Let's analyze the most stable chair conformation of Product 2, (2S, 3R, 4S), which has substituents C2-Bn(β), C3-Ph(β), C4-TBSO(α). The conformation that minimizes steric strain places the large phenyl and TBSO groups in equatorial positions (C3-Ph(eq,β), C4-TBSO(eq,α)) and the benzyl group in an axial position (C2-Bn(ax,β)).\n    *   The incoming electrophile (CH3I) will be directed by these existing groups. The most significant steric interaction for the C6 position is the 1,3-diaxial interaction with the axial benzyl group at C2(β). This bulky group on the β face will block the approach of the methyl group from the axial (β) direction.\n    *   Therefore, the methyl group will add from the opposite, unhindered α face, which corresponds to the equatorial position at C6.\n    *   Let's determine the CIP configuration for the new C6 center with a methyl group at the α position (and H at β). The priorities are C1 > C5 > CH3 > H. With the lowest priority group H(β) pointing forward, the path from C1 -> C5 -> CH3 is clockwise (R). Since H is in front, we reverse the assignment to (S).\n*   **Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard acidic workup to cleave the silyl ether protecting group (TBSO-), regenerating the hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction does not affect the stereocenters of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nThis structure matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem that requires careful tracking of stereochemistry. I will break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Initial Analysis & Plan**\n1.  **Step 1: Protection.** Determine the structure of Product 1 after protecting the alcohol of (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n2.  **Step 2: Conjugate Addition & Alkylation.** Determine the structure and stereochemistry of Product 2. This involves a 1,4-addition of a phenyl group, followed by trapping the resulting enolate with benzyl bromide. The stereochemistry will be dictated by the existing chiral center.\n3.  **Step 3: Second Alkylation.** Determine the structure and stereochemistry of Product 3. This involves forming an enolate with LDA at low temperature (kinetic control) and trapping it with iodomethane. We must determine if the methylation occurs at C2 or C6.\n4.  **Step 4: Deprotection.** Determine the final structure of Product 4 after removing the protecting group and compare it with the given options.\n\n**Execution**\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection**\n    *   Starting Material: (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. The stereochemistry at C4 is (S). For a bulky substituent on a cyclohexene ring, it will prefer a pseudo-equatorial position. To satisfy the (S) configuration, we will define the OTBS group as being on the \"up\" face (wedge).\n    *   Product 1: (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 2: Phenyl Addition and Benzylation**\n    *   **Phenyl Addition:** The Gilman reagent (Ph2CuLi) performs a 1,4-conjugate addition. The nucleophilic phenyl group will attack the double bond at C3 from the face *anti* to the bulky C4-OTBS group. Since the OTBS group is \"up\", the phenyl group adds from the \"down\" face (dash).\n    *   **Stereochemistry at C3:** The C4-OTBS is \"up\" (S). The new C3-Ph is \"down\". Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities at C3 (C4 > C2 > Ph > H), with the H being \"up\", the configuration is (R). So, we have a (3R, 4S) relationship. This eliminates option C.\n    *   **Enolate Trapping (Benzylation):** An enolate is formed between C1 and C2. This lithium enolate is then trapped by benzyl bromide. The stereochemistry of this step can be complex. The incoming electrophile (benzyl) will approach from the less sterically hindered face. The C3-Ph group is \"down\". One might expect *anti*-addition, with the benzyl group adding \"up\". However, chelation control is also possible, where the Li+ cation coordinates with both the enolate oxygen and the C4-OTBS oxygen, blocking the \"up\" face. This forces the benzyl group to add from the \"down\" face, *syn* to the phenyl group. Let's assume this chelation control occurs, as it leads to one of the answers. If the benzyl group adds \"down\" (dash), the C2 stereocenter becomes (S).\n    *   **Product 2:** (2S, 3R, 4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 3: Methylation**\n    *   Product 2 is treated with LDA and CH3I at low temperature. LDA is a bulky, strong base that, at low temperatures, forms the kinetic enolate by deprotonating the most accessible α-proton.\n    *   The α-protons are at C2 (tertiary, highly substituted) and C6 (secondary, less substituted). LDA will preferentially deprotonate at C6. This eliminates options B and C, which show methylation at C2.\n    *   **Enolate Formation and Methylation at C6:** The most stable conformation of Product 2 has C4-OTBS (eq, up), C3-Ph (eq, down), and C2-Bn (ax, down). LDA removes a proton from C6. Due to stereoelectronic effects, the axial proton at C6 (\"down\") is removed preferentially. The resulting enolate is then attacked by iodomethane. The methyl group will add axially from the less hindered \"up\" face (opposite to the C2-Bn group).\n    *   **Stereochemistry at C6:** The new methyl group is axial and \"up\". The remaining hydrogen is equatorial and \"down\". Assigning priorities (C1 > C5 > Me > H), with H being \"down\", the configuration is (S).\n    *   **Product 3:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 4: Deprotection**\n    *   Treatment with aqueous HCl removes the TBS protecting group from the C4 oxygen, yielding a hydroxyl group. This reaction does not affect any of the stereocenters.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    *   The final structure and stereochemistry, (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one, perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. This is a cyclic enone with a hydroxyl group at the C4 position, which is a stereocenter with (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) is a nucleophile that attacks the silicon atom of TBSCl. Triethylamine is a base that neutralizes the hydrochloric acid (HCl) byproduct, driving the reaction to completion. This reaction protects the alcohol as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether. The stereochemistry at C4 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate Addition and Enolate Trapping**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph₂CuLi), a Gilman reagent. 2. Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Conjugate Addition:** Gilman reagents perform a 1,4- or conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The phenyl nucleophile (Ph⁻) attacks the β-carbon (C3) of the enone system. The stereochemistry of this addition is controlled by the existing stereocenter at C4. The bulky TBSO- group directs the incoming phenyl group to the opposite face of the ring (*anti*-addition). Assuming the (S)-OTBS group is on the 'up' face (beta), the phenyl group will add from the 'down' face (alpha). This results in a *trans* relationship between the substituents at C3 and C4, leading to a (3R, 4S) configuration. This addition creates an enolate intermediate between C1 and C2.\n    2.  **Enolate Trapping:** The enolate intermediate is a potent nucleophile. It is immediately trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The alkylation occurs at the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this step is controlled by the newly introduced phenyl group at the adjacent C3 position. The incoming benzyl group will add *anti* to the phenyl group to minimize steric hindrance. Since the phenyl group added from the 'down' face (R), the benzyl group will add from the 'up' face (S).\n*   **Product 2:** (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: α-Alkylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH₃I) at low temperature.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the ketone at the α-position to form an enolate. The C2 position is already a quaternary carbon (it has no protons), so deprotonation occurs at C6. LDA typically forms the kinetic enolate, which is the less substituted or more accessible one.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting enolate attacks the electrophile, iodomethane, adding a methyl group at the C6 position. The stereochemistry is controlled by the bulky substituents already on the ring (at C2, C3, and C4). These groups create a sterically hindered face, forcing the methyl group to add from the opposite, less hindered face. The substituents at C2 (benzyl, up) and C4 (OTBS, up) block the top face, so the methyl group will add from the bottom face. A substituent on the bottom face at C6 has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** The acidic conditions cleave the TBS silyl ether, converting it back to a hydroxyl group. This is the deprotection step.\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options:\n\n*   A) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - Incorrect stereochemistry at C3 and incorrect position for the methyl group.\n*   B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 and incorrect position for the methyl group.\n*   D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - This matches the structure derived from the step-by-step analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the hydroxyl group**\nThe starting material, (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine. This reaction protects the secondary alcohol as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether. Triethylamine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl formed during the reaction. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon remains (S).\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Tandem conjugate addition and alkylation**\nProduct 1 is treated with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Conjugate Addition:** The Gilman reagent performs a 1,4- or conjugate addition, where the phenyl group (acting as a soft nucleophile) attacks the β-carbon (C3) of the enone system. The bulky TBS-ether group at C4, which is in the (S) configuration (assumed to be pointing up, or β), sterically directs the incoming phenyl group to the opposite face of the ring (anti-addition). Therefore, the phenyl group adds to the down (or α) face. This establishes a new stereocenter at C3 with an (R) configuration. This reaction forms a lithium enolate intermediate.\n*   **Alkylation:** The enolate intermediate is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The alkylation occurs at the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this step is controlled by the adjacent, newly added phenyl group at C3. The incoming benzyl group will add to the face opposite (anti) to the C3-phenyl group to minimize steric hindrance. Since the phenyl group is α, the benzyl group will add to the β face, resulting in an (S) configuration at C2.\n*   **Product 2:** (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Methylation at the α-carbon**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I) at low temperature.\n*   LDA is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base used to form enolates. In Product 2, the C2 position is a quaternary carbon (no protons), so deprotonation must occur at the other α-carbon, C6. LDA at low temperature typically forms the kinetic enolate, which involves removing the most accessible proton.\n*   The resulting enolate at C6 then attacks iodomethane in an SN2 reaction, adding a methyl group to the C6 position. The stereochemistry of this addition is directed by the existing bulky substituents on the ring (C2-benzyl, C3-phenyl, and C4-OTBS). The question specifies the resulting stereochemistry in the final product options.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nProduct 3 is treated with aqueous HCl. This is a standard method for removing silyl ether protecting groups like TBS, regenerating the hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product 4:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe reaction sequence leads to a cyclohexanone ring substituted with a benzyl group at C2, a phenyl group at C3, a hydroxyl group at C4, and a methyl group at C6. Comparing this structure and its derived stereochemistry with the given options, it exactly matches option D. The other options are incorrect because they either have the methyl group at the wrong position (A and C) or represent a completely different and implausible molecular structure (B).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\nThe starting material, (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine. This reaction protects the hydroxyl group (-OH) as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether (-OTBS) to prevent it from reacting in subsequent steps. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon remains (S).\n\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate addition and α-alkylation**\nProduct 1 is treated with diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Conjugate Addition:** The Gilman reagent performs a 1,4- or conjugate addition to the α,β-unsaturated ketone. The phenyl nucleophile (Ph-) attacks the β-carbon (C3). To minimize steric hindrance, the phenyl group adds to the face of the ring opposite to the bulky -OTBS group at C4. This establishes a *trans* relationship between the substituents at C3 and C4. With the starting material having an (S) configuration at C4, this directed attack results in an (R) configuration at the newly formed C3 stereocenter.\n*   **Enolate Alkylation:** The conjugate addition forms a lithium enolate intermediate. This enolate is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The alkylation occurs at the α-carbon (C2). The incoming benzyl group will also add to the face opposite the adjacent, bulky phenyl group at C3 to minimize steric interactions. This results in a *trans* relationship between the groups at C2 and C3, leading to an (S) configuration at C2.\n\n*   **Product 2:** (2S, 3R, 4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Second α-alkylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I).\n*   **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base used to deprotonate a ketone at the α-carbon. In Product 2, the α-carbon at C2 has no protons. Therefore, LDA deprotonates the other α-carbon at C6, which has two protons. The use of LDA at low temperatures favors the formation of the kinetic enolate.\n*   **Alkylation:** The resulting enolate attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group to the C6 position. The stereochemical outcome of this step depends on the direction of attack on the enolate. The existing bulky substituents on the ring will direct the approach of the electrophile. The most stable chair conformation of the intermediate has the C4-OTBS and C2-benzyl groups in equatorial positions and the C3-phenyl group in an axial position. This axial phenyl group sterically hinders the bottom face of the ring, forcing the methylation to occur from the top face. This trajectory, combined with kinetic control conditions (LDA, low temperature), favors the formation of an axial methyl group at C6, which corresponds to an (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nProduct 3 is treated with aqueous HCl. This is a standard acidic workup to remove the TBS protecting group, converting the silyl ether back into a hydroxyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. This is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with a chiral alcohol at the C4 position. The (S) configuration determines the absolute stereochemistry. For drawing purposes, we will represent the hydroxyl group with a wedge (\"up\").\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et₃N).\n*   **Reaction:** TBSCl is a bulky protecting group for alcohols. It reacts with the hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a silyl ether (-OTBS). Triethylamine is a base that neutralizes the HCl byproduct. This protection step does not affect the stereocenter.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The bulky -OTBS group is at C4, maintaining the (S) configuration (\"up\").\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate addition and enolate trapping**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Ph₂CuLi (Lithium diphenylcuprate, a Gilman reagent) at low temperature.\n    2.  Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a tandem 1,4-addition followed by enolate alkylation.\n    1.  **Michael Addition:** The Gilman reagent adds a phenyl group (Ph) to the β-carbon (C3). The stereochemistry of this addition is controlled by the existing stereocenter at C4. While additions to such systems are often *anti* to the C4 substituent, in some cases, a *syn* addition can occur. To match the final product, we must assume a *syn* addition occurs, where the phenyl group adds from the same face as the OTBS group. With the C4-OTBS group \"up\" (wedge), the C3-phenyl group also adds from the \"up\" face (wedge). This creates a new stereocenter at C3 with an (R) configuration.\n    2.  **Enolate Alkylation:** The resulting lithium enolate is trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The enolate attacks the benzyl group, which adds to the α-carbon (C2). This alkylation is directed *anti* to the bulky substituents at C3 and C4. The benzyl group will add from the face opposite to the OTBS and phenyl groups, i.e., from the \"down\" face (dash). This creates a new stereocenter at C2 with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Product 2:** (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one. The relative stereochemistry is C4-OTBS is *cis* to C3-Ph, and both are *trans* to C2-Bn.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of a second enolate and alkylation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a substituted cyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) at low temperature.\n    2.  Iodomethane (CH₃I).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base. It selectively deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon (C6) to form the kinetic enolate.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate reacts with iodomethane. The stereochemistry of this alkylation is controlled by the bulky substituents on the ring. The most stable chair conformation of Product 2 places all three large substituents (OTBS, Ph, Bn) in equatorial positions. The incoming electrophile (CH₃⁺) will attack the enolate from the less hindered face. The C4-OTBS group is extremely bulky and shields the top face of the ring. Therefore, the methyl group will preferentially attack from the bottom face. This results in a methyl group on the \"down\" face (dash).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** A methyl group on the \"down\" face at C6 results in an (S) configuration at this new stereocenter.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** The acid cleaves the silyl ether, removing the TBS protecting group and regenerating the hydroxyl group (-OH).

The resulting enolate intermediate can then be trapped by an alkyl halide like benzyl bromide in a subsequent alkylation step. The stereochemistry of such tandem reactions is highly controlled. The incoming nucleophile (phenyl) adds *anti* to existing bulky substituents (the C4-OTBS group). The subsequent alkylation at the alpha-carbon (C2) is also stereocontrolled, often proceeding *anti* to the newly introduced group at C3. My initial stereochemical analysis of (2S,3R,4S) for Product 2 is consistent with these principles.\n\n*   **Step 3 (Enolate Formation/Alkylation):** The use of a strong, bulky base like LDA at low temperature favors the formation of the kinetic enolate. For an asymmetrically substituted cyclohexanone like Product 2, the kinetic enolate is formed by deprotonating the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In Product 2, the C2 position is a quaternary carbon and has no protons. The only available α-protons are at C6. Therefore, LDA will deprotonate at C6. The subsequent alkylation with iodomethane will also occur at C6. The stereochemistry of this alkylation is typically axial, as this leads to a more stable chair-like transition state.\n\n*   **Step 4 (Deprotection):** Aqueous HCl is a standard reagent for cleaving TBS silyl ethers, restoring the hydroxyl group.\n\nBased on this confirmed reaction pathway, the step-by-step synthesis is as follows:\n\n1.  **(S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one** is protected with TBSCl to give **Product 1**, (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The (S) stereocenter at C4 is retained.\n\n2.  Product 1 undergoes conjugate addition with Ph2CuLi. The phenyl group adds to C3, *anti* to the bulky TBSO group at C4, resulting in a (3R, 4S) configuration. The intermediate enolate is then alkylated with benzyl bromide at C2. The benzyl group adds *anti* to the adjacent phenyl group, leading to a (2S) configuration. **Product 2** is therefore (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n3.  Product 2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane. LDA, a bulky base, forms the kinetic enolate by removing a proton from the less hindered C6 position. The enolate then attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group at C6. The incoming methyl group will add to the axial position to proceed through a lower energy, chair-like transition state, resulting in a (6S) configuration. **Product 3** is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n4.  Product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl, which removes the TBS protecting group to yield the final alcohol. **Product 4** is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nThis final structure matches option D.\n\nFinal check of the options:\n*   A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 and incorrect position of the methyl group.\n*   B) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: Incorrect stereochemistry at C3 and incorrect position of the methyl group.\n*   C) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol: Incorrect structure.\n*   D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: Matches the predicted structure and stereochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nThe chemical logic is sound and supported by general principles found in the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\nThe reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  **Protection:** The hydroxyl group of (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is protected by reacting with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine to form Product 1, (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The stereochemistry at C4 is preserved.\n\n2.  **Conjugate Addition and Alkylation:** Product 1 is treated with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, which performs a 1,4-conjugate addition. The phenyl group adds to the C3 position from the face opposite (anti) to the bulky TBSO group at C4. This establishes the stereochemistry as (3R, 4S). The resulting enolate intermediate is then trapped by benzyl bromide, which adds a benzyl group to the C2 position. This addition occurs anti to the adjacent phenyl group, resulting in a (2S) configuration. Thus, Product 2 is (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Second Alkylation (Methylation):** Product 2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane. LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base that, at low temperatures, selectively removes a proton from the least hindered α-carbon to form the kinetic enolate. In Product 2, the C2 position is a quaternary carbon with no protons, so deprotonation occurs at C6. The resulting kinetic enolate reacts with iodomethane to add a methyl group at the C6 position. Stereochemically, the alkylation of cyclohexanone enolates tends to proceed via axial attack, which leads to a more stable chair-like transition state. This results in a (6S) configuration. Product 3 is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Deprotection:** Finally, treatment with aqueous HCl removes the TBS silyl ether protecting group, regenerating the hydroxyl group at C4.\n\nThe final product, Product 4, is **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe synthesis proceeds through four key steps:\n1.  **Protection:** The hydroxyl group of the starting material is protected with a bulky TBS group.\n2.  **Tandem Addition/Alkylation:** A phenyl group is added to C3 via 1,4-conjugate addition, and the resulting enolate is trapped at C2 with a benzyl group.\n3.  **Kinetic Alkylation:** The ketone is deprotonated at the less sterically hindered C6 position using the bulky base LDA, and the resulting enolate is methylated.\n4.  **Deprotection:** The TBS protecting group is removed with acid to reveal the final hydroxyl group.\n\nThe final product, 4, is a cyclohexanone with a benzyl group at C2, a phenyl group at C3, a hydroxyl group at C4, and a methyl group at C6. This structure corresponds to the name (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\nThe starting material, (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, has a secondary alcohol. This alcohol is protected by reacting it with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) in the presence of triethylamine (a base). This reaction converts the hydroxyl (-OH) group into a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy (-OTBS) group, forming Product 1, (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon remains (S).\n\n**Step 2: Tandem Conjugate Addition and Alkylation**\nProduct 1 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. It undergoes a tandem reaction sequence.\n*   First, the Gilman reagent, lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), acts as a soft nucleophile, adding a phenyl group to the β-carbon (C3) via a 1,4-conjugate addition. The stereochemistry is controlled by the bulky -OTBS group at C4; the phenyl group adds from the opposite face (*anti*-addition). This establishes a *trans* relationship between the C4-OTBS group and the C3-phenyl group, resulting in an (R) configuration at C3.\n*   This addition creates an enolate intermediate, which is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide (BnBr). The benzyl group adds to the α-carbon (C2). The approach of the benzyl group is directed by the newly added phenyl group at C3, adding from the opposite face (*anti*-addition). This results in a *trans* relationship between the C2-benzyl group and the C3-phenyl group, leading to an (S) configuration at C2.\n*   The resulting Product 2 is (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Second α-Alkylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), a strong, bulky base, followed by iodomethane (CH3I).\n*   LDA deprotonates the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. Product 2 has two α-positions: C2 and C6. The C2 position has no protons as it is already substituted with the benzyl group. Therefore, LDA removes a proton from the C6 position.\n*   The resulting enolate is then alkylated by iodomethane. The existing bulky groups on one face of the ring direct the incoming methyl group to the opposite, less sterically hindered face. This results in the methyl group at C6 being *trans* to the benzyl group at C2. This stereochemical outcome corresponds to an (S) configuration at C6.\n*   Product 3 is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nFinally, Product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl. The acid cleaves the silyl ether protecting group, regenerating the hydroxyl group at C4 without changing the stereochemistry.\n\nThe final product, Product 4, is **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\nThe starting material, (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N). This is a standard procedure to protect the hydroxyl group (-OH) as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon is retained.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate addition followed by alkylation**\nProduct 1 is treated with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, followed by benzyl bromide.\n*   **Conjugate Addition:** Gilman reagents are soft nucleophiles and perform a 1,4-conjugate (or Michael) addition to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The phenyl group (Ph-) attacks the β-carbon (C3) of the cyclohexenone ring. To minimize steric hindrance, the phenyl group adds from the face opposite to the bulky OTBS group at C4. This is called *anti*-addition. Since the stereocenter at C4 is (S), the *anti*-addition of the phenyl group at C3 results in an (R) configuration.\n*   **Enolate Alkylation:** The conjugate addition forms a lithium enolate intermediate. This enolate is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The enolate attacks the benzyl group in an SN2 reaction. To minimize steric hindrance with the newly added and bulky phenyl group at the adjacent C3 position, the benzyl group will add from the face opposite to the phenyl group. This results in a *trans* relationship between the benzyl and phenyl groups and establishes the stereocenter at C2 as (S).\n*   **Product 2:** (2S, 3R, 4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Second alkylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and then iodomethane (CH3I).\n*   **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base that is used to form kinetic enolates. It deprotonates the most accessible α-proton. In product 2, the C2 position has no protons (it is a quaternary carbon). Therefore, LDA deprotonates at the C6 position.\n*   **Alkylation:** The resulting enolate attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group to the C6 carbon. The stereochemistry of this addition is controlled by the existing substituents on the ring. The bulky groups will direct the incoming methyl group to the less sterically hindered position, which is typically the equatorial position. This results in the (S) configuration at C6.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nProduct 3 is treated with aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl). This step removes the TBS protecting group from the oxygen, regenerating the hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction does not affect the stereochemistry of the carbon centers.\n*   **Product 4:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - Incorrect stereochemistry and methylation at the wrong position.\n*   B) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - Incorrect stereochemistry and methylation at the wrong position.\n*   C) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol - Incorrect structure.\n*   D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - This matches the derived structure and stereochemistry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Careful Points and Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n    *   **Reaction:** The starting material, (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard protection reaction. The hydroxyl group (-OH) is converted into a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether (-OTBS). This is necessary to prevent the acidic proton of the alcohol from interfering with the organometallic and enolate chemistry in the following steps. The reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C4, so Product 1 is (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tandem Conjugate Addition and Alkylation**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph₂CuLi) and then benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Analysis of Conjugate Addition (Ph₂CuLi):** Ph₂CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is a soft nucleophile that excels at 1,4-conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The phenyl group (Ph) will add to the β-carbon (C3). The stereochemistry is controlled by the bulky -OTBS group at C4. The phenyl group will add from the face *opposite* (*anti*-addition) to the -OTBS group to minimize steric hindrance. This establishes a *trans* relationship between the substituents at C3 and C4. Given the (S) configuration at C4, the *anti*-addition at C3 results in an (R) configuration.\n    *   **Analysis of Alkylation (BnBr):** The conjugate addition forms a lithium enolate intermediate. This nucleophilic enolate is then \"trapped\" by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The alkylation occurs at the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this step is controlled by the newly introduced phenyl group at C3. The incoming benzyl group will add *anti* to the C3-phenyl group to minimize steric strain. Since the phenyl group is *trans* to the C4-OTBS group, the benzyl group will be *cis* to the C4-OTBS group.

At low temperatures, it selectively removes the most accessible α-proton to form the *kinetic enolate*. In Product 2, the α-carbon at C2 is tertiary and heavily hindered. The α-carbon at C6 is secondary and much less hindered. Therefore, LDA will deprotonate at C6. This is a crucial point that eliminates options B and D, which show methylation at C2.\n    *   **Analysis of Alkylation (CH₃I):** The kinetic enolate at C6 attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group. The stereochemistry is controlled by the existing bulky substituents on the ring. The incoming electrophile will approach from the less sterically hindered face of the enolate. The bulky groups at C2, C3, and C4 will direct the methyl group to add from the opposite face, resulting in an axial attack. This leads to the (S) configuration at the new C6 stereocenter.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Deprotection**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard acidic workup to cleave the silyl ether protecting group.

The hydroxyl group is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine. This reaction protects the alcohol as a TBDMS ether, which is stable under the basic conditions of the subsequent steps. The product is (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one (Product 1).\n\n**Step 2: Tandem Conjugate Addition and Alkylation**\nProduct 1, an α,β-unsaturated ketone, is treated with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent. Gilman reagents are known to perform 1,4-conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated systems. The phenyl group (Ph) adds to the C3 position. Stereochemically, the addition occurs anti to the bulky TBDMS ether at C4. Assuming the TBDMS group is in a stable equatorial position (\"down\"), the phenyl group will add from the opposite (axial, \"up\") face. This establishes a *trans* relationship between the C4 and C3 substituents, resulting in a (3R, 4S) configuration.\n\nThis addition forms a lithium enolate intermediate. This enolate is then \"trapped\" by the addition of benzyl bromide (BnBr). The enolate, being a strong nucleophile, attacks the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, adding the benzyl group to the C2 position. The stereochemistry of this alkylation is controlled by the adjacent, bulky axial phenyl group at C3, which directs the incoming benzyl group to the opposite face. This results in the benzyl group adding to the equatorial position (\"down\"). This leads to a (2S) configuration.\n\nThus, Product 2 is (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Second Alkylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I). LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base used to form enolates. In an unsymmetrical ketone like Product 2, LDA typically deprotonates the less substituted α-carbon to form the kinetic enolate. The α-carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is trisubstituted (with H, benzyl, and phenyl groups nearby), while C6 is disubstituted (with two protons). Therefore, LDA will selectively deprotonate at C6.\n\nThe resulting enolate at C6 then attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group. The stereochemistry of this methylation is influenced by the existing bulky substituents on the other side of the ring. The large axial phenyl group at C3 will direct the methyl group to add from the opposite face, leading to an axial attack from the \"down\" side. This results in a (6S) configuration.\n\nSo, Product 3 is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nFinally, Product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl. This is a standard acidic workup condition used to cleave TBDMS ethers, regenerating the hydroxyl group. This step does not affect the stereocenters on the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe final product, Product 4, is therefore **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the established principles of stereocontrol in conjugate additions and enolate alkylations, the structure of the final product matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n(S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine. The TBSCl protects the hydroxyl group as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether. Triethylamine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl formed during the reaction. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon remains (S).\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate addition and α-alkylation**\nProduct 1 undergoes a 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition) with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi). The phenyl group (Ph) acts as a soft nucleophile and adds to the C3 position of the α,β-unsaturated ketone. Stereochemically, the incoming phenyl group will add to the face opposite the bulky TBSO group at C4. This results in a *trans* relationship between the C4-OTBS and the new C3-Ph group. Given that C4 is (S), the addition of the phenyl group leads to an (R) configuration at C3. This reaction forms a lithium enolate intermediate, which is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide (BnBr). The benzyl group adds to the α-carbon (C2). To achieve the most thermodynamically stable product, the bulky substituents will prefer equatorial positions. This leads to the benzyl group adding *cis* to the C4-OTBS group and *trans* to the C3-phenyl group.\n*   **Product 2:** (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Second α-alkylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane. LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base that forms the kinetic enolate. It will deprotonate the ketone at the less substituted α-carbon, which is C6. The resulting enolate then reacts with iodomethane, adding a methyl group to the C6 position. For maximum stability, the methyl group will add to the equatorial position. This stereochemical outcome results in an (S) configuration at the C6 carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nProduct 3 is treated with aqueous HCl. The acidic conditions cleave the TBS ether, regenerating the hydroxyl group (-OH).

The phenyl anion (Ph-) attacks the β-carbon (C3). The bulky OTBS group at C4 is on the bottom face (dash), so the phenyl group will attack from the less sterically hindered top face. This means the phenyl group adds to C3 on a **wedge**. This addition creates a lithium enolate intermediate.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The benzyl group (Bn) adds to the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this step is crucial. The newly introduced phenyl group at the adjacent C3 position is on a wedge. While steric hindrance would normally favor the incoming benzyl group to add from the opposite face (dash), certain reaction conditions (especially with lithium enolates) can lead to a syn-addition, possibly directed by chelation. To match the provided options, we must assume a syn-alkylation occurs. Therefore, the benzyl group also adds from the top face, on a **wedge**.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting cyclohexanone has the following stereochemistry:\n    *   C4: -OTBS (dash) -> (S) configuration (from starting material)\n    *   C3: -Ph (wedge) -> (R) configuration\n    *   C2: -Bn (wedge) -> (S) configuration\n    *   The stereochemistry of Product 2 is (2S, 3R, 4S).\n\n**Step 3: Kinetic enolate formation and methylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, 2. Iodomethane (CH3I).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base. At low temperatures (-78 °C), it selectively removes the most accessible (kinetically favored) α-proton. The ketone has two α-positions: C2 and C6. C2 is heavily substituted (bearing a benzyl group and adjacent to a phenyl-substituted carbon). C6 is much less hindered. Therefore, LDA deprotonates at C6 to form the kinetic enolate, with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group to C6. The alkylation of cyclohexanone enolates generally proceeds to place the new substituent in the more stable equatorial position.\n*   **Product 3:** A methyl group is added to C6. To determine its stereochemistry, we consider the most stable chair conformation of the ring. The bulky substituents at C2, C3, and C4 will dictate the conformation. The most stable arrangement places the C2-Bn and C4-OTBS groups equatorially, forcing the C3-Ph group to be axial. In this conformation, an equatorial position at C6 corresponds to a **dash**. A methyl group on a dash at C6 results in an **(S)** configuration.\n*   The stereochemistry of Product 3 is **(2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** The acidic aqueous workup cleaves the silyl ether (OTBS) protecting group, regenerating the hydroxyl (-OH) group at C4. This reaction does not alter any of the stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexanone with four stereocenters.\n    *   Name: **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect structure and functional groups.\n*   B) Incorrect site of methylation (C2 instead of C6) and incorrect stereochemistry.\n*   C) Incorrect site of methylation (C2 instead of C6).\n*   D) **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**. This matches our derived structure and stereochemistry perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. This is a six-membered ring containing a ketone, a double bond, and a hydroxyl group. The stereochemistry at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (C4) is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard protection reaction for an alcohol. The hydroxyl group at C4 acts as a nucleophile and attacks the silicon atom of TBSCl. Triethylamine is a non-nucleophilic base that neutralizes the HCl byproduct. The stereochemistry at C4 is preserved.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. For stereochemical analysis, we can define the side of the ring with the bulky -OTBS group as the \"up\" face.\n\n**Step 2: Tandem Conjugate Addition and Alkylation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ph2CuLi (lithium diphenylcuprate, a Gilman reagent) at low temperature. 2. Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-part reaction occurring in one pot.\n    1.  **Conjugate Addition:** The Gilman reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile (Ph-), which performs a 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition). The phenyl group attacks the β-carbon (C3) of the enone system. Stereochemically, the nucleophile adds from the face opposite to the bulky -OTBS group at C4. Since the -OTBS group is \"up\", the phenyl group adds from the \"down\" face. This creates a new stereocenter at C3, and the substituents at C3 and C4 are *trans* to each other. This addition generates a lithium enolate intermediate with the double bond between C1 and C2.\n    2.  **Enolate Trapping:** The benzyl bromide is an electrophile that is attacked by the nucleophilic enolate. The alkylation occurs at the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this step is controlled by the substituent at C3. The phenyl group at C3 is on the \"down\" face and sterically hinders the approach of the electrophile from that side. Therefore, the benzyl group adds from the \"up\" face.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting product is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohexan-1-one. The relative stereochemistry is: C4-OTBS (up), C3-Ph (down), and C2-Bn (up). Based on the starting material C4 being (S), the absolute configurations of the new centers are C3-(R) and C2-(S).\n\n**Step 3: Kinetic Alkylation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) at low temperature. 2. Iodomethane (CH3I).\n*   **Reaction:** This is another enolate formation followed by alkylation.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky base. At low temperatures, it selectively deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon to form the kinetic enolate. In Product 2, the α-carbons are C2 (tertiary, very hindered) and C6 (secondary, less hindered). LDA will deprotonate C6, forming the enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n    2.  **Methylation:** The enolate attacks iodomethane to add a methyl group at C6. The stereochemical outcome is determined by chelation control. The lithium cation of the enolate can coordinate with both the enolate oxygen at C1 and the ether oxygen of the -OTBS group at C4. This forms a rigid chelate on the \"up\" face of the ring. This complex directs the electrophile (CH3I) to attack from the same \"up\" face.\n*   **Product 3:** The methyl group is added to the \"up\" face at C6. The resulting product is 2-benzyl-6-methyl-3-phenyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohexan-1-one. The new stereocenter at C6 has the (S) configuration. The overall stereochemistry is (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S).\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** The acidic conditions cleave the silyl ether (TBS group), regenerating the hydroxyl group at C4. This deprotection step does not affect the stereochemistry of any of the chiral centers.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product, Product 4, has the following structure and stereochemistry:\n*   A cyclohexanone ring.\n*   A benzyl group at C2.\n*   A phenyl group at C3.\n*   A hydroxyl group at C4.\n*   A methyl group at C6.\n*   The absolute stereochemistry is (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S).\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n*   **A) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one:** This matches our derived structure and stereochemistry.\n*   **B) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. Methylation occurs at C6, not C2.\n*   **C) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol:** Incorrect structure.\n*   **D) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one:** Incorrect. Methylation occurs at C6, not C2, and the stereochemistry at C3 is incorrect.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis to determine the structure of the final product, 4.\n\n**Starting Material: (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one**\n\n*   This is a six-membered ring containing a ketone at C1, a double bond between C2 and C3, and a hydroxyl group at C4.\n*   The stereocenter at C4 has the (S) configuration. For drawing purposes, we can represent the -OH group with a wedge, assuming standard ring orientation.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard protection reaction for an alcohol. The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C4 is converted into a bulky silyl ether (-OTBS). Triethylamine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The stereochemistry at C4 is retained. The bulky TBS group will be crucial for directing the stereochemistry of the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi) at low temperature, 2. Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Part 1 (Ph2CuLi):** This is a Gilman reagent, which performs a 1,4-conjugate addition (or Michael addition) to the α,β-unsaturated ketone. The phenyl anion (Ph-) acts as the nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon (C3).\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The addition is stereoselective. The very bulky TBSO- group at C4 (wedge) will block the top face of the ring, forcing the incoming phenyl group to attack from the opposite (bottom) face. This results in the phenyl group being *trans* to the TBSO group. So, the Ph group will be on a dash.\n    *   This creates a new stereocenter at C3. With the C4-OTBS group being (S, wedge), the C3-Ph group (dash) will have the (R) configuration.\n    *   This reaction forms a lithium enolate intermediate, with the negative charge delocalized between the C1 oxygen and the C2 carbon.\n*   **Reaction Part 2 (BnBr):** The enolate formed in the first part is a nucleophile and is trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. This is a C-alkylation reaction at the α-carbon (C2).\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry of this alkylation is controlled by the adjacent substituent at C3. The benzyl group will approach from the face *anti* (opposite) to the bulky phenyl group at C3. Since the phenyl group is on a dash, the benzyl group will add from the top face (wedge).\n    *   This creates another stereocenter at C2. With the C3-Ph group being (R, dash), the C2-Bn group (wedge) will have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting structure is (2S, 3R, 4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I) at low temperature.\n*   **Reaction:** LDA is a strong, sterically hindered, non-nucleophilic base. It is used to form the *kinetic* enolate of a ketone.\n    *   **Regiochemistry:** The ketone (Product 2) has two α-carbons with protons: C2 and C6. The proton at C2 is highly sterically hindered by the adjacent benzyl and phenyl groups. The protons at C6 are much more accessible. LDA will preferentially deprotonate the less hindered position, C6.\n    *   The resulting kinetic enolate is formed across C1 and C6.\n    *   **Alkylation:** This enolate then reacts with iodomethane, adding a methyl group to C6.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry of the methylation at C6 is controlled by the existing bulky groups on the ring. To minimize steric interactions, the substituents at C2, C3, and C4 will adopt equatorial positions in the most stable chair-like conformation. The incoming methyl group will attack from the less hindered face. The bulky equatorial benzyl group at C2 will direct the methyl group to attack from the opposite face, which corresponds to an axial attack. This places the methyl group on a dash.\n    *   This creates the final stereocenter at C6. The axial methyl group (dash) results in an (S) configuration at C6.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the deprotection step. The acid cleaves the silyl ether bond, converting the TBSO- group back into a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Product 4:** This reaction does not typically affect the other stereocenters under mild conditions. The final product is (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived structure and name with the given options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol: Incorrect molecular structure.\n*   B) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: This perfectly matches our derived product.\n*   C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: Incorrect regiochemistry of methylation (C2 instead of C6) and incorrect stereochemistry at C3.\n*   D) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: Incorrect regiochemistry of methylation (C2 instead of C6) and incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n\nThe correct final product is described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. This is a six-membered ring containing a ketone (C1), a double bond (C2-C3), and a hydroxyl group (C4). The (S) stereochemistry at C4 dictates that the -OH group is on a dashed bond (pointing away from the viewer in a standard 2D representation).\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard protection reaction for an alcohol. The hydroxyl group at C4 attacks the silicon atom of TBSCl, and the triethylamine base neutralizes the HCl byproduct. The -OH group is converted into a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether (-OTBS). The stereochemistry at C4 is retained.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The -OTBS group is on a dashed bond.\n\n**Step 2: Tandem conjugate addition and α-alkylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent. 2. Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction 1 (Conjugate Addition):** Gilman reagents perform 1,4-conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The nucleophilic phenyl group (\"Ph-\") attacks the β-carbon (C3). The stereochemical outcome is controlled by the bulky -OTBS group at C4. Since the -OTBS group is on the α-face (dashed), it directs the incoming phenyl group to the opposite β-face (wedged). This establishes the relative stereochemistry between C3 and C4 as *trans*. The resulting stereocenter at C3 is (R). This reaction generates a lithium enolate intermediate with the double bond between C1 and C2.\n*   **Reaction 2 (α-Alkylation):** The enolate intermediate is a nucleophile and is trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The enolate attacks the benzyl group, which adds to the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this addition is controlled by the newly introduced bulky phenyl group at C3. Since the phenyl group is on the β-face (wedged), it directs the incoming benzyl group to the opposite α-face (dashed). This establishes the relative stereochemistry between C2 and C3 as *trans*. The resulting stereocenter at C2 is (R).\n*   **Product 2:** (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Second α-alkylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I) at low temperature.\n*   **Reaction:** LDA is a strong, bulky base used to form enolates. There are two acidic α-protons: one at C2 and two at C6.\n    *   **Kinetic vs. Thermodynamic Control:** LDA at low temperature typically deprotonates the less sterically hindered position to form the *kinetic enolate*. In this case, that would be C6. However, this pathway does not lead to any of the given options.\n    *   Alternatively, deprotonation at the more substituted C2 position would form the more stable *thermodynamic enolate*. This is sterically hindered but results in a more substituted double bond in the enolate. Given the provided options, we must assume that the reaction conditions allow for the formation of the thermodynamic enolate, which is then trapped by iodomethane.\n*   **Alkylation:** The thermodynamic enolate attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group to C2. C2 already has a benzyl group on the α-face (dashed). The incoming methyl group will add from the less hindered, opposite β-face (wedged). This creates a quaternary stereocenter at C2.\n*   **Stereochemistry of C2:** The priorities are C1 > C3 > Benzyl > Methyl. With the benzyl group dashed and the methyl group wedged, the configuration at C2 is (R).\n*   **Product 3:** (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-2-methyl-3-phenyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** The acidic conditions cleave the silyl ether bond, removing the TBS protecting group and regenerating the hydroxyl group (-OH) at C4. This step does not affect the stereochemistry of the carbon skeleton.\n*   **Final Product 4:** (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived structure and stereochemistry with the given options:\n*   A) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - Incorrect methylation site and C2 stereochemistry.\n*   B) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - **This matches our derived product exactly.**\n*   C) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol - Incorrect structure.\n*   D) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - Incorrect C2 and C3 stereochemistry.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. To determine the stereochemistry, we use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. For the stereocenter at C4 to be (S), the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be in the α position (pointing down or back).\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group is a nucleophile that attacks the silicon atom of TBSCl. This is a standard protection reaction for alcohols. The bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) group is attached to the oxygen. Triethylamine acts as a non-nucleophilic base to neutralize the HCl byproduct. The stereochemistry at C4 is retained.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The TBSO- group is in the α position.\n\n**Step 2: Tandem 1,4-conjugate addition and enolate alkylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Part 1 (Conjugate Addition):** Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is excellent for 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition) to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The phenyl nucleophile (Ph-) will add to the β-carbon (C3) of the enone system. The stereochemistry of this addition is controlled by the existing stereocenter at C4. The bulky TBSO- group is in the α position. To minimize steric hindrance, the phenyl group will attack from the opposite face, which is the β face (anti-addition).\n    *   Addition of Ph to the β face at C3 creates a new stereocenter. With Ph(β) and H(α), and priorities Ph > C4 > C2 > H, the configuration at C3 is (R).\n    *   So far, we have a (3R, 4S) intermediate.\n*   **Reaction Part 2 (Enolate Alkylation):** The conjugate addition forms a lithium enolate intermediate at C1-C2. This enolate is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The stereochemistry of this alkylation at C2 is directed by the newly introduced bulky phenyl group at C3(β). While anti-addition is generally favored sterically, leading to the benzyl group adding to the α face (giving a 2R configuration), this does not lead to any of the options. Let's consider the path that leads to the given options. For option A, a (2S) configuration is required. This means the benzyl group must add to the β face, *syn* to the phenyl group. While sterically less favorable, this can sometimes occur due to conformational effects of the enolate. Assuming this *syn*-addition occurs:\n    *   Addition of the benzyl group to the β face at C2 creates a new stereocenter. With Bn(β) and H(α), and priorities C1 > C3 > Bn > H, the configuration at C2 is (S).\n*   **Product 2:** (2S, 3R, 4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Second alkylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I) at low temperature.\n*   **Reaction (Enolate Formation):** LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base. At low temperatures, it selectively removes the most accessible proton to form the kinetic enolate. Product 2 has two types of α-protons: one at C2 (tertiary, attached to a benzyl group, and adjacent to a phenyl group, making it very hindered) and two at C6 (secondary, much less hindered). LDA will deprotonate at the less hindered C6 position.\n*   **Reaction (Alkylation):** The resulting kinetic enolate at C1-C6 reacts with iodomethane, adding a methyl group to C6. We need to determine the stereochemistry of this addition.\n    *   Let's analyze the most stable chair conformation of Product 2, (2S, 3R, 4S), which has substituents C2-Bn(β), C3-Ph(β), C4-TBSO(α). The conformation that minimizes steric strain places the large phenyl and TBSO groups in equatorial positions (C3-Ph(eq,β), C4-TBSO(eq,α)) and the benzyl group in an axial position (C2-Bn(ax,β)).\n    *   The incoming electrophile (CH3I) will be directed by these existing groups. The most significant steric interaction for the C6 position is the 1,3-diaxial interaction with the axial benzyl group at C2(β). This bulky group on the β face will block the approach of the methyl group from the axial (β) direction.\n    *   Therefore, the methyl group will add from the opposite, unhindered α face, which corresponds to the equatorial position at C6.\n    *   Let's determine the CIP configuration for the new C6 center with a methyl group at the α position (and H at β). The priorities are C1 > C5 > CH3 > H. With the lowest priority group H(β) pointing forward, the path from C1 -> C5 -> CH3 is clockwise (R). Since H is in front, we reverse the assignment to (S).\n*   **Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard acidic workup to cleave the silyl ether protecting group (TBSO-), regenerating the hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction does not affect the stereocenters of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nThis structure matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem that requires careful tracking of stereochemistry. I will break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Initial Analysis & Plan**\n1.  **Step 1: Protection.** Determine the structure of Product 1 after protecting the alcohol of (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n2.  **Step 2: Conjugate Addition & Alkylation.** Determine the structure and stereochemistry of Product 2. This involves a 1,4-addition of a phenyl group, followed by trapping the resulting enolate with benzyl bromide. The stereochemistry will be dictated by the existing chiral center.\n3.  **Step 3: Second Alkylation.** Determine the structure and stereochemistry of Product 3. This involves forming an enolate with LDA at low temperature (kinetic control) and trapping it with iodomethane. We must determine if the methylation occurs at C2 or C6.\n4.  **Step 4: Deprotection.** Determine the final structure of Product 4 after removing the protecting group and compare it with the given options.\n\n**Execution**\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection**\n    *   Starting Material: (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. The stereochemistry at C4 is (S). For a bulky substituent on a cyclohexene ring, it will prefer a pseudo-equatorial position. To satisfy the (S) configuration, we will define the OTBS group as being on the \"up\" face (wedge).\n    *   Product 1: (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 2: Phenyl Addition and Benzylation**\n    *   **Phenyl Addition:** The Gilman reagent (Ph2CuLi) performs a 1,4-conjugate addition. The nucleophilic phenyl group will attack the double bond at C3 from the face *anti* to the bulky C4-OTBS group. Since the OTBS group is \"up\", the phenyl group adds from the \"down\" face (dash).\n    *   **Stereochemistry at C3:** The C4-OTBS is \"up\" (S). The new C3-Ph is \"down\". Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities at C3 (C4 > C2 > Ph > H), with the H being \"up\", the configuration is (R). So, we have a (3R, 4S) relationship. This eliminates option C.\n    *   **Enolate Trapping (Benzylation):** An enolate is formed between C1 and C2. This lithium enolate is then trapped by benzyl bromide. The stereochemistry of this step can be complex. The incoming electrophile (benzyl) will approach from the less sterically hindered face. The C3-Ph group is \"down\". One might expect *anti*-addition, with the benzyl group adding \"up\". However, chelation control is also possible, where the Li+ cation coordinates with both the enolate oxygen and the C4-OTBS oxygen, blocking the \"up\" face. This forces the benzyl group to add from the \"down\" face, *syn* to the phenyl group. Let's assume this chelation control occurs, as it leads to one of the answers. If the benzyl group adds \"down\" (dash), the C2 stereocenter becomes (S).\n    *   **Product 2:** (2S, 3R, 4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 3: Methylation**\n    *   Product 2 is treated with LDA and CH3I at low temperature. LDA is a bulky, strong base that, at low temperatures, forms the kinetic enolate by deprotonating the most accessible α-proton.\n    *   The α-protons are at C2 (tertiary, highly substituted) and C6 (secondary, less substituted). LDA will preferentially deprotonate at C6. This eliminates options B and C, which show methylation at C2.\n    *   **Enolate Formation and Methylation at C6:** The most stable conformation of Product 2 has C4-OTBS (eq, up), C3-Ph (eq, down), and C2-Bn (ax, down). LDA removes a proton from C6. Due to stereoelectronic effects, the axial proton at C6 (\"down\") is removed preferentially. The resulting enolate is then attacked by iodomethane. The methyl group will add axially from the less hindered \"up\" face (opposite to the C2-Bn group).\n    *   **Stereochemistry at C6:** The new methyl group is axial and \"up\". The remaining hydrogen is equatorial and \"down\". Assigning priorities (C1 > C5 > Me > H), with H being \"down\", the configuration is (S).\n    *   **Product 3:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 4: Deprotection**\n    *   Treatment with aqueous HCl removes the TBS protecting group from the C4 oxygen, yielding a hydroxyl group. This reaction does not affect any of the stereocenters.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    *   The final structure and stereochemistry, (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one, perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. This is a cyclic enone with a hydroxyl group at the C4 position, which is a stereocenter with (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) is a nucleophile that attacks the silicon atom of TBSCl. Triethylamine is a base that neutralizes the hydrochloric acid (HCl) byproduct, driving the reaction to completion. This reaction protects the alcohol as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether. The stereochemistry at C4 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate Addition and Enolate Trapping**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph₂CuLi), a Gilman reagent. 2. Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Conjugate Addition:** Gilman reagents perform a 1,4- or conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The phenyl nucleophile (Ph⁻) attacks the β-carbon (C3) of the enone system. The stereochemistry of this addition is controlled by the existing stereocenter at C4. The bulky TBSO- group directs the incoming phenyl group to the opposite face of the ring (*anti*-addition). Assuming the (S)-OTBS group is on the 'up' face (beta), the phenyl group will add from the 'down' face (alpha). This results in a *trans* relationship between the substituents at C3 and C4, leading to a (3R, 4S) configuration. This addition creates an enolate intermediate between C1 and C2.\n    2.  **Enolate Trapping:** The enolate intermediate is a potent nucleophile. It is immediately trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The alkylation occurs at the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this step is controlled by the newly introduced phenyl group at the adjacent C3 position. The incoming benzyl group will add *anti* to the phenyl group to minimize steric hindrance. Since the phenyl group added from the 'down' face (R), the benzyl group will add from the 'up' face (S).\n*   **Product 2:** (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: α-Alkylation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH₃I) at low temperature.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the ketone at the α-position to form an enolate. The C2 position is already a quaternary carbon (it has no protons), so deprotonation occurs at C6. LDA typically forms the kinetic enolate, which is the less substituted or more accessible one.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting enolate attacks the electrophile, iodomethane, adding a methyl group at the C6 position. The stereochemistry is controlled by the bulky substituents already on the ring (at C2, C3, and C4). These groups create a sterically hindered face, forcing the methyl group to add from the opposite, less hindered face. The substituents at C2 (benzyl, up) and C4 (OTBS, up) block the top face, so the methyl group will add from the bottom face. A substituent on the bottom face at C6 has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** The acidic conditions cleave the TBS silyl ether, converting it back to a hydroxyl group. This is the deprotection step.\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options:\n\n*   A) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - Incorrect stereochemistry at C3 and incorrect position for the methyl group.\n*   B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 and incorrect position for the methyl group.\n*   D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - This matches the structure derived from the step-by-step analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the hydroxyl group**\nThe starting material, (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine. This reaction protects the secondary alcohol as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether. Triethylamine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl formed during the reaction. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon remains (S).\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Tandem conjugate addition and alkylation**\nProduct 1 is treated with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Conjugate Addition:** The Gilman reagent performs a 1,4- or conjugate addition, where the phenyl group (acting as a soft nucleophile) attacks the β-carbon (C3) of the enone system. The bulky TBS-ether group at C4, which is in the (S) configuration (assumed to be pointing up, or β), sterically directs the incoming phenyl group to the opposite face of the ring (anti-addition). Therefore, the phenyl group adds to the down (or α) face. This establishes a new stereocenter at C3 with an (R) configuration. This reaction forms a lithium enolate intermediate.\n*   **Alkylation:** The enolate intermediate is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The alkylation occurs at the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this step is controlled by the adjacent, newly added phenyl group at C3. The incoming benzyl group will add to the face opposite (anti) to the C3-phenyl group to minimize steric hindrance. Since the phenyl group is α, the benzyl group will add to the β face, resulting in an (S) configuration at C2.\n*   **Product 2:** (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Methylation at the α-carbon**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I) at low temperature.\n*   LDA is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base used to form enolates. In Product 2, the C2 position is a quaternary carbon (no protons), so deprotonation must occur at the other α-carbon, C6. LDA at low temperature typically forms the kinetic enolate, which involves removing the most accessible proton.\n*   The resulting enolate at C6 then attacks iodomethane in an SN2 reaction, adding a methyl group to the C6 position. The stereochemistry of this addition is directed by the existing bulky substituents on the ring (C2-benzyl, C3-phenyl, and C4-OTBS). The question specifies the resulting stereochemistry in the final product options.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nProduct 3 is treated with aqueous HCl. This is a standard method for removing silyl ether protecting groups like TBS, regenerating the hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product 4:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe reaction sequence leads to a cyclohexanone ring substituted with a benzyl group at C2, a phenyl group at C3, a hydroxyl group at C4, and a methyl group at C6. Comparing this structure and its derived stereochemistry with the given options, it exactly matches option D. The other options are incorrect because they either have the methyl group at the wrong position (A and C) or represent a completely different and implausible molecular structure (B).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\nThe starting material, (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine. This reaction protects the hydroxyl group (-OH) as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether (-OTBS) to prevent it from reacting in subsequent steps. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon remains (S).\n\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate addition and α-alkylation**\nProduct 1 is treated with diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Conjugate Addition:** The Gilman reagent performs a 1,4- or conjugate addition to the α,β-unsaturated ketone. The phenyl nucleophile (Ph-) attacks the β-carbon (C3). To minimize steric hindrance, the phenyl group adds to the face of the ring opposite to the bulky -OTBS group at C4. This establishes a *trans* relationship between the substituents at C3 and C4. With the starting material having an (S) configuration at C4, this directed attack results in an (R) configuration at the newly formed C3 stereocenter.\n*   **Enolate Alkylation:** The conjugate addition forms a lithium enolate intermediate. This enolate is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The alkylation occurs at the α-carbon (C2). The incoming benzyl group will also add to the face opposite the adjacent, bulky phenyl group at C3 to minimize steric interactions. This results in a *trans* relationship between the groups at C2 and C3, leading to an (S) configuration at C2.\n\n*   **Product 2:** (2S, 3R, 4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Second α-alkylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I).\n*   **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base used to deprotonate a ketone at the α-carbon. In Product 2, the α-carbon at C2 has no protons. Therefore, LDA deprotonates the other α-carbon at C6, which has two protons. The use of LDA at low temperatures favors the formation of the kinetic enolate.\n*   **Alkylation:** The resulting enolate attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group to the C6 position. The stereochemical outcome of this step depends on the direction of attack on the enolate. The existing bulky substituents on the ring will direct the approach of the electrophile. The most stable chair conformation of the intermediate has the C4-OTBS and C2-benzyl groups in equatorial positions and the C3-phenyl group in an axial position. This axial phenyl group sterically hinders the bottom face of the ring, forcing the methylation to occur from the top face. This trajectory, combined with kinetic control conditions (LDA, low temperature), favors the formation of an axial methyl group at C6, which corresponds to an (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nProduct 3 is treated with aqueous HCl. This is a standard acidic workup to remove the TBS protecting group, converting the silyl ether back into a hydroxyl group.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. This is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with a chiral alcohol at the C4 position. The (S) configuration determines the absolute stereochemistry. For drawing purposes, we will represent the hydroxyl group with a wedge (\"up\").\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et₃N).\n*   **Reaction:** TBSCl is a bulky protecting group for alcohols. It reacts with the hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a silyl ether (-OTBS). Triethylamine is a base that neutralizes the HCl byproduct. This protection step does not affect the stereocenter.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The bulky -OTBS group is at C4, maintaining the (S) configuration (\"up\").\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate addition and enolate trapping**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Ph₂CuLi (Lithium diphenylcuprate, a Gilman reagent) at low temperature.\n    2.  Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a tandem 1,4-addition followed by enolate alkylation.\n    1.  **Michael Addition:** The Gilman reagent adds a phenyl group (Ph) to the β-carbon (C3). The stereochemistry of this addition is controlled by the existing stereocenter at C4. While additions to such systems are often *anti* to the C4 substituent, in some cases, a *syn* addition can occur. To match the final product, we must assume a *syn* addition occurs, where the phenyl group adds from the same face as the OTBS group. With the C4-OTBS group \"up\" (wedge), the C3-phenyl group also adds from the \"up\" face (wedge). This creates a new stereocenter at C3 with an (R) configuration.\n    2.  **Enolate Alkylation:** The resulting lithium enolate is trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The enolate attacks the benzyl group, which adds to the α-carbon (C2). This alkylation is directed *anti* to the bulky substituents at C3 and C4. The benzyl group will add from the face opposite to the OTBS and phenyl groups, i.e., from the \"down\" face (dash). This creates a new stereocenter at C2 with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Product 2:** (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one. The relative stereochemistry is C4-OTBS is *cis* to C3-Ph, and both are *trans* to C2-Bn.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of a second enolate and alkylation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a substituted cyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) at low temperature.\n    2.  Iodomethane (CH₃I).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base. It selectively deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon (C6) to form the kinetic enolate.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate reacts with iodomethane. The stereochemistry of this alkylation is controlled by the bulky substituents on the ring. The most stable chair conformation of Product 2 places all three large substituents (OTBS, Ph, Bn) in equatorial positions. The incoming electrophile (CH₃⁺) will attack the enolate from the less hindered face. The C4-OTBS group is extremely bulky and shields the top face of the ring. Therefore, the methyl group will preferentially attack from the bottom face. This results in a methyl group on the \"down\" face (dash).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** A methyl group on the \"down\" face at C6 results in an (S) configuration at this new stereocenter.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** The acid cleaves the silyl ether, removing the TBS protecting group and regenerating the hydroxyl group (-OH). This step does not affect the stereocenters on the carbon skeleton.\n*   **Final Product 4:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe final product has the stereochemistry (2S,3R,4S,6S). Comparing this to the options provided:\nA) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - This matches our derived structure and stereochemistry.\nB) Incorrect methylation position and stereochemistry.\nC) Incorrect molecular structure.\nD) Incorrect methylation position and stereochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe search results confirm the key principles of the reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition/Alkylation):** Gilman reagents (Ph2CuLi) perform 1,4-conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The resulting enolate intermediate can then be trapped by an alkyl halide like benzyl bromide in a subsequent alkylation step. The stereochemistry of such tandem reactions is highly controlled. The incoming nucleophile (phenyl) adds *anti* to existing bulky substituents (the C4-OTBS group). The subsequent alkylation at the alpha-carbon (C2) is also stereocontrolled, often proceeding *anti* to the newly introduced group at C3. My initial stereochemical analysis of (2S,3R,4S) for Product 2 is consistent with these principles.\n\n*   **Step 3 (Enolate Formation/Alkylation):** The use of a strong, bulky base like LDA at low temperature favors the formation of the kinetic enolate. For an asymmetrically substituted cyclohexanone like Product 2, the kinetic enolate is formed by deprotonating the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In Product 2, the C2 position is a quaternary carbon and has no protons. The only available α-protons are at C6. Therefore, LDA will deprotonate at C6. The subsequent alkylation with iodomethane will also occur at C6. The stereochemistry of this alkylation is typically axial, as this leads to a more stable chair-like transition state.\n\n*   **Step 4 (Deprotection):** Aqueous HCl is a standard reagent for cleaving TBS silyl ethers, restoring the hydroxyl group.\n\nBased on this confirmed reaction pathway, the step-by-step synthesis is as follows:\n\n1.  **(S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one** is protected with TBSCl to give **Product 1**, (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The (S) stereocenter at C4 is retained.\n\n2.  Product 1 undergoes conjugate addition with Ph2CuLi. The phenyl group adds to C3, *anti* to the bulky TBSO group at C4, resulting in a (3R, 4S) configuration. The intermediate enolate is then alkylated with benzyl bromide at C2. The benzyl group adds *anti* to the adjacent phenyl group, leading to a (2S) configuration. **Product 2** is therefore (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n3.  Product 2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane. LDA, a bulky base, forms the kinetic enolate by removing a proton from the less hindered C6 position. The enolate then attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group at C6. The incoming methyl group will add to the axial position to proceed through a lower energy, chair-like transition state, resulting in a (6S) configuration. **Product 3** is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n4.  Product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl, which removes the TBS protecting group to yield the final alcohol. **Product 4** is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nThis final structure matches option D.\n\nFinal check of the options:\n*   A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 and incorrect position of the methyl group.\n*   B) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: Incorrect stereochemistry at C3 and incorrect position of the methyl group.\n*   C) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol: Incorrect structure.\n*   D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one: Matches the predicted structure and stereochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nThe chemical logic is sound and supported by general principles found in the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\nThe reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  **Protection:** The hydroxyl group of (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is protected by reacting with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine to form Product 1, (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The stereochemistry at C4 is preserved.\n\n2.  **Conjugate Addition and Alkylation:** Product 1 is treated with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, which performs a 1,4-conjugate addition. The phenyl group adds to the C3 position from the face opposite (anti) to the bulky TBSO group at C4. This establishes the stereochemistry as (3R, 4S). The resulting enolate intermediate is then trapped by benzyl bromide, which adds a benzyl group to the C2 position. This addition occurs anti to the adjacent phenyl group, resulting in a (2S) configuration. Thus, Product 2 is (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Second Alkylation (Methylation):** Product 2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane. LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base that, at low temperatures, selectively removes a proton from the least hindered α-carbon to form the kinetic enolate. In Product 2, the C2 position is a quaternary carbon with no protons, so deprotonation occurs at C6. The resulting kinetic enolate reacts with iodomethane to add a methyl group at the C6 position. Stereochemically, the alkylation of cyclohexanone enolates tends to proceed via axial attack, which leads to a more stable chair-like transition state. This results in a (6S) configuration. Product 3 is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Deprotection:** Finally, treatment with aqueous HCl removes the TBS silyl ether protecting group, regenerating the hydroxyl group at C4.\n\nThe final product, Product 4, is **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe synthesis proceeds through four key steps:\n1.  **Protection:** The hydroxyl group of the starting material is protected with a bulky TBS group.\n2.  **Tandem Addition/Alkylation:** A phenyl group is added to C3 via 1,4-conjugate addition, and the resulting enolate is trapped at C2 with a benzyl group.\n3.  **Kinetic Alkylation:** The ketone is deprotonated at the less sterically hindered C6 position using the bulky base LDA, and the resulting enolate is methylated.\n4.  **Deprotection:** The TBS protecting group is removed with acid to reveal the final hydroxyl group.\n\nThe final product, 4, is a cyclohexanone with a benzyl group at C2, a phenyl group at C3, a hydroxyl group at C4, and a methyl group at C6. This structure corresponds to the name (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\nThe starting material, (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, has a secondary alcohol. This alcohol is protected by reacting it with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) in the presence of triethylamine (a base). This reaction converts the hydroxyl (-OH) group into a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy (-OTBS) group, forming Product 1, (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon remains (S).\n\n**Step 2: Tandem Conjugate Addition and Alkylation**\nProduct 1 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. It undergoes a tandem reaction sequence.\n*   First, the Gilman reagent, lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), acts as a soft nucleophile, adding a phenyl group to the β-carbon (C3) via a 1,4-conjugate addition. The stereochemistry is controlled by the bulky -OTBS group at C4; the phenyl group adds from the opposite face (*anti*-addition). This establishes a *trans* relationship between the C4-OTBS group and the C3-phenyl group, resulting in an (R) configuration at C3.\n*   This addition creates an enolate intermediate, which is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide (BnBr). The benzyl group adds to the α-carbon (C2). The approach of the benzyl group is directed by the newly added phenyl group at C3, adding from the opposite face (*anti*-addition). This results in a *trans* relationship between the C2-benzyl group and the C3-phenyl group, leading to an (S) configuration at C2.\n*   The resulting Product 2 is (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Second α-Alkylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), a strong, bulky base, followed by iodomethane (CH3I).\n*   LDA deprotonates the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. Product 2 has two α-positions: C2 and C6. The C2 position has no protons as it is already substituted with the benzyl group. Therefore, LDA removes a proton from the C6 position.\n*   The resulting enolate is then alkylated by iodomethane. The existing bulky groups on one face of the ring direct the incoming methyl group to the opposite, less sterically hindered face. This results in the methyl group at C6 being *trans* to the benzyl group at C2. This stereochemical outcome corresponds to an (S) configuration at C6.\n*   Product 3 is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nFinally, Product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl. The acid cleaves the silyl ether protecting group, regenerating the hydroxyl group at C4 without changing the stereochemistry.\n\nThe final product, Product 4, is **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\nThe starting material, (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N). This is a standard procedure to protect the hydroxyl group (-OH) as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon is retained.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate addition followed by alkylation**\nProduct 1 is treated with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, followed by benzyl bromide.\n*   **Conjugate Addition:** Gilman reagents are soft nucleophiles and perform a 1,4-conjugate (or Michael) addition to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The phenyl group (Ph-) attacks the β-carbon (C3) of the cyclohexenone ring. To minimize steric hindrance, the phenyl group adds from the face opposite to the bulky OTBS group at C4. This is called *anti*-addition. Since the stereocenter at C4 is (S), the *anti*-addition of the phenyl group at C3 results in an (R) configuration.\n*   **Enolate Alkylation:** The conjugate addition forms a lithium enolate intermediate. This enolate is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The enolate attacks the benzyl group in an SN2 reaction. To minimize steric hindrance with the newly added and bulky phenyl group at the adjacent C3 position, the benzyl group will add from the face opposite to the phenyl group. This results in a *trans* relationship between the benzyl and phenyl groups and establishes the stereocenter at C2 as (S).\n*   **Product 2:** (2S, 3R, 4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Second alkylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and then iodomethane (CH3I).\n*   **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base that is used to form kinetic enolates. It deprotonates the most accessible α-proton. In product 2, the C2 position has no protons (it is a quaternary carbon). Therefore, LDA deprotonates at the C6 position.\n*   **Alkylation:** The resulting enolate attacks iodomethane, adding a methyl group to the C6 carbon. The stereochemistry of this addition is controlled by the existing substituents on the ring. The bulky groups will direct the incoming methyl group to the less sterically hindered position, which is typically the equatorial position. This results in the (S) configuration at C6.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nProduct 3 is treated with aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl). This step removes the TBS protecting group from the oxygen, regenerating the hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction does not affect the stereochemistry of the carbon centers.\n*   **Product 4:** (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - Incorrect stereochemistry and methylation at the wrong position.\n*   B) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - Incorrect stereochemistry and methylation at the wrong position.\n*   C) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol - Incorrect structure.\n*   D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one - This matches the derived structure and stereochemistry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
