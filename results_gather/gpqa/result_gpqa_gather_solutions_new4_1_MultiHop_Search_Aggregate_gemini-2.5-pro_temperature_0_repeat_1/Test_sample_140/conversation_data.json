Here is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6:** The amide ion removes the proton from the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in place. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from the C2 position. Subsequently, the bromide ion is eliminated from C1, resulting in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more readily than the C-D bond, so Path A is generally faster. However, both pathways are possible and lead to the formation of two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe amide anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) adds to C1. The subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (o-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group adds to C6. The subsequent protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (m-deuterioaniline).\n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from Path B):**\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Since this intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium, the addition of the amino group to either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, results in the formation of a single product: **aniline**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the outcomes of all possible pathways, three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction mechanism to determine the possible products:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion is a strong base and will remove a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, resulting in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This is generally slower due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond), but it still occurs. This pathway leads to a different benzyne intermediate, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Attack on the first benzyne (from Path A):** This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, with deuterium at C2.\n        *   If the amide attacks C1, the resulting product after protonation is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   If the amide attacks C6, the product formed is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack on the second benzyne (from Path B):** This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no longer contains deuterium.\n        *   Attack by the amide at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\nTherefore, the reaction yields a mixture of three possible organic products: aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction mechanism, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\n\nThe reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). The amide ion (:NH2⁻) is a very strong base that will abstract an acidic proton from the benzene ring. The most acidic protons are those located ortho to the bromine atom, due to bromine's inductive electron-withdrawing effect.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the amide base will abstract the proton (H⁺) from C6 more readily than the deuteron (d⁺) from C2. However, both pathways are possible.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  The carbanion intermediate then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the ring in this process.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possibly formed in this reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (:NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile can attack either carbon.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of the C6 carbanion by NH3 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of the C1 carbanion by NH3 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the -NH2 group, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2. The nucleophile can attack either carbon.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, the subsequent protonation by NH3 will result in the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Mechanism Analysis**\n\n**Step I: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  The resulting negative charge on C6 causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting negative charge on C2 causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Careful Point:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. This is known as the kinetic isotope effect. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is the major pathway, and Pathway B (abstraction of D) is the minor pathway. However, the question asks for *all possible* products, so we must consider the products from both intermediates.\n\n**Step II: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as the nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂ adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂ adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH₂⁻ attacks either C1 or C2. The resulting carbanion is protonated. In either case, the final product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**3. Summary of All Possible Products**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that occurs via a benzyne mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C2:** This position is occupied by a deuterium atom (D).\n2.  **Position C6:** This position is occupied by a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, a base will abstract a proton (H+) more readily and quickly than a deuteron (D+). However, both abstractions are possible. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is slower than H+ abstraction.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    4.  The deuterium atom is removed from the ring. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2-), attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final product(s).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The incoming NH2- can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the NH2 group at C1, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. The NH2- can attack either C1 or C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, the subsequent protonation results in the same product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Count the Total Number of Possible Products**\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* organic products, we must count all products that can be formed, even those formed via a minor pathway. Therefore, there are 3 possible products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2). This provides the amide ion (:NH2-), which is a very strong base and a good nucleophile.\n*   **Solvent:** Liquid ammonia (NH3). It acts as a solvent and a proton source in the final step.\n*   **Mechanism:** The conditions are classic for an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton from C6 is significantly faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2.\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion intermediate then loses the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    Although slower, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 by the strong base is still a possible reaction pathway.\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this step, the resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile, the amide ion (NH2-), to the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3).\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate from Path A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The nucleophile NH2- can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields **aniline-2-d** (or 2-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields **aniline-3-d** (or 3-deuterioaniline).\n    So, Path A leads to two distinct products.\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate from Path B (Benzyne)**\n    This intermediate is the standard non-deuterated benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The amide ion can attack either C1 or C2. Due to the symmetry of the intermediate with respect to the outcome, both attacks lead to the formation of a carbanion which, upon protonation by NH3, yields the same single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    So, Path B leads to one product.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition reactions, we can identify all the possible organic products.\n1.  **Aniline-2-d** (from Path A)\n2.  **Aniline-3-d** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nThese three products are structurally distinct isomers (isotopomers). Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *possible* products, so even though the products from Path B (aniline) will be formed in a smaller amount than those from Path A, they must be included in the count.\n\nThe final answer is 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is a very strong base, and the amide ion (NH₂⁻) is the active species.\n\n**2. Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong amide base (NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the proton (H) from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D) from C2. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways, even if one is slower.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n        2.  This carbanion induces the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n           (Visualizing the process: Br at C1, D at C2. H is removed from C6. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. D is still at C2).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n        2.  This carbanion induces the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n          (Visualizing the process: Br at C1, D at C2. D is removed from C2. A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The resulting benzyne has no deuterium).\n\n**Stage 2: Addition (Formation of Final Products)**\n\nThe nucleophile (NH₂⁻) now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at position C3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway A leads to two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate B (Benzyne)**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C2. Protonation of C2 yields **aniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C2:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C2, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 also yields **aniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway B leads to only one product: aniline.\n\n**Summary of Possible Products**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we have three unique organic molecules:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction mechanism proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. The key is to consider all possible pathways for the formation of the intermediate and the subsequent addition of the nucleophile.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the possible sites for deprotonation on the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, by the strong base NaNH2.\n2.  Determine the structure of the benzyne intermediate(s) formed from each deprotonation pathway.\n3.  For each unique benzyne intermediate, determine the possible products formed by the addition of the amide nucleophile (NH2-).\n4.  Count the total number of unique organic products.\n\n**Execution of Step 1 & 2:**\nThe starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The strong base, amide (NH2-), will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. There are two such positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H). Abstraction of this H is fast and leads to an anion at C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D). Abstraction of D is slower than H abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-D bond is stronger than C-H). However, it is still a possible pathway. Abstraction of this D leads to an anion at C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\nThus, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Execution of Step 3:**\nNow, we consider the nucleophilic addition of the amide ion (NH2-) to each of these intermediates, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne:** The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and a deuterium is at C2. The NH2- can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from non-deuterated benzyne:** The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there are no deuterium atoms.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH2- group adds to either C1 or C2. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent. Since there is no deuterium label, the only product from this pathway is **aniline**.\n\n**Execution of Step 4:**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.**\n*   **Position 2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.**\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, a C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than a C-D bond. This means two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Major Pathway (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at position 2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Minor Pathway (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is a slower process but still possible. The elimination of the bromide ion results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this intermediate is the non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the highly reactive triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from the major pathway):**\n    *   Attack at C1: The amino group attaches to C1, and subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6: The amino group attaches to C6, and subsequent protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from the minor pathway):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The use of isotopic labeling is a classic method to elucidate this reaction pathway.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from the position ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions with different isotopes: a deuterium at C2 and a hydrogen at C6.\n\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** The amide ion can abstract the hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, resulting in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** Alternatively, the amide ion can abstract the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This leads to the formation of a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this intermediate, the deuterium atom has been removed.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack and Product Formation:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n    *   **From the C1-C6 Benzyne (with Deuterium at C2):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The amino group attaches to C1. Subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (*o*-deuterioaniline).\n        *   Attack at C6: The amino group attaches to C6. Subsequent protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (*m*-deuterioaniline).\n\n    *   **From the C1-C2 Benzyne (without Deuterium):**\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 by the amide ion, followed by protonation, results in the formation of **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, the reaction yields a mixture of three possible organic products: aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.

This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, resulting in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at the C2 position remains in this intermediate. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from the C2 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is simply **benzyne**, with no deuterium.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A is favored, but both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-), acting as a nucleophile, then attacks the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n*   **From 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at C1: The NH2- group adds to C1. This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6: The NH2- group adds to C6. This results in the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **From benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2: Since this intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium, the addition of the NH2- group at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCounting the distinct organic molecules produced from all possible pathways, we have:\n1.

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can remove a hydrogen atom (H) from position 6. This is generally faster than removing deuterium due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond). This elimination of HBr leads to the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**, where the triple bond is between carbons 1 and 6, and the deuterium remains at position 2.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom (D) from position 2. This is a slower process but still possible. This elimination of DBr results in a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. This benzyne intermediate does not contain deuterium.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at carbon 1 leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at carbon 6 leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from the non-deuterated benzyne (from Pathway B):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) attacks the benzyne formed after the deuterium was removed.\n        *   Attack at either carbon 1 or 2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, results in the formation of **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, the three possible organic products from this reaction are 2-deuterioaniline, 3-deuterioaniline, and aniline.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python code successfully simulated the elimination-addition reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2).\n\nThe simulation followed these steps:\n1.  **Elimination:** Two different benzyne intermediates were formed.

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Abstraction of H from C6:** The amide ion removes the proton from position 6. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from position 1 results in the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium remains at position 3 relative to the new triple bond.\n2.  **Abstraction of D from C2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from position 2.

This pathway leads to a different benzyne intermediate, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne's triple bond.

Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\n\nThe reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). The amide ion (:NH2⁻) is a very strong base that will abstract an acidic proton from the benzene ring. The most acidic protons are those located ortho to the bromine atom, due to bromine's inductive electron-withdrawing effect.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the amide base will abstract the proton (H⁺) from C6 more readily than the deuteron (d⁺) from C2. However, both pathways are possible.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  The carbanion intermediate then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the ring in this process.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possibly formed in this reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (:NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile can attack either carbon.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of the C6 carbanion by NH3 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of the C1 carbanion by NH3 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the -NH2 group, the deuterium is at position 3.

Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Mechanism Analysis**\n\n**Step I: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  The resulting negative charge on C6 causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting negative charge on C2 causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Careful Point:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. This is known as the kinetic isotope effect. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is the major pathway, and Pathway B (abstraction of D) is the minor pathway. However, the question asks for *all possible* products, so we must consider the products from both intermediates.\n\n**Step II: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as the nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂ adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂ adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH₂⁻ attacks either C1 or C2. The resulting carbanion is protonated. In either case, the final product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**3. Summary of All Possible Products**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that occurs via a benzyne mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C2:** This position is occupied by a deuterium atom (D).\n2.  **Position C6:** This position is occupied by a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, a base will abstract a proton (H+) more readily and quickly than a deuteron (D+). However, both abstractions are possible. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is slower than H+ abstraction.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    4.  The deuterium atom is removed from the ring. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2-), attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final product(s).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The incoming NH2- can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the NH2 group at C1, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. The NH2- can attack either C1 or C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, the subsequent protonation results in the same product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Count the Total Number of Possible Products**\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* organic products, we must count all products that can be formed, even those formed via a minor pathway. Therefore, there are 3 possible products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2). This provides the amide ion (:NH2-), which is a very strong base and a good nucleophile.\n*   **Solvent:** Liquid ammonia (NH3). It acts as a solvent and a proton source in the final step.\n*   **Mechanism:** The conditions are classic for an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton from C6 is significantly faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2.\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion intermediate then loses the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    Although slower, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 by the strong base is still a possible reaction pathway.\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this step, the resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile, the amide ion (NH2-), to the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3).\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate from Path A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The nucleophile NH2- can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields **aniline-2-d** (or 2-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields **aniline-3-d** (or 3-deuterioaniline).\n    So, Path A leads to two distinct products.\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate from Path B (Benzyne)**\n    This intermediate is the standard non-deuterated benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The amide ion can attack either C1 or C2. Due to the symmetry of the intermediate with respect to the outcome, both attacks lead to the formation of a carbanion which, upon protonation by NH3, yields the same single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    So, Path B leads to one product.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition reactions, we can identify all the possible organic products.\n1.  **Aniline-2-d** (from Path A)\n2.  **Aniline-3-d** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nThese three products are structurally distinct isomers (isotopomers). Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *possible* products, so even though the products from Path B (aniline) will be formed in a smaller amount than those from Path A, they must be included in the count.\n\nThe final answer is 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is a very strong base, and the amide ion (NH₂⁻) is the active species.\n\n**2. Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong amide base (NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the proton (H) from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D) from C2. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways, even if one is slower.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n        2.  This carbanion induces the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n           (Visualizing the process: Br at C1, D at C2. H is removed from C6. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. D is still at C2).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n        2.  This carbanion induces the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n          (Visualizing the process: Br at C1, D at C2. D is removed from C2. A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The resulting benzyne has no deuterium).\n\n**Stage 2: Addition (Formation of Final Products)**\n\nThe nucleophile (NH₂⁻) now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at position C3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway A leads to two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate B (Benzyne)**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C2. Protonation of C2 yields **aniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C2:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C2, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 also yields **aniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway B leads to only one product: aniline.\n\n**Summary of Possible Products**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we have three unique organic molecules:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction mechanism proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. The key is to consider all possible pathways for the formation of the intermediate and the subsequent addition of the nucleophile.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the possible sites for deprotonation on the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, by the strong base NaNH2.\n2.  Determine the structure of the benzyne intermediate(s) formed from each deprotonation pathway.\n3.  For each unique benzyne intermediate, determine the possible products formed by the addition of the amide nucleophile (NH2-).\n4.  Count the total number of unique organic products.\n\n**Execution of Step 1 & 2:**\nThe starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The strong base, amide (NH2-), will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. There are two such positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H). Abstraction of this H is fast and leads to an anion at C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D). Abstraction of D is slower than H abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-D bond is stronger than C-H). However, it is still a possible pathway. Abstraction of this D leads to an anion at C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\nThus, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Execution of Step 3:**\nNow, we consider the nucleophilic addition of the amide ion (NH2-) to each of these intermediates, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne:** The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and a deuterium is at C2. The NH2- can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from non-deuterated benzyne:** The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there are no deuterium atoms.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH2- group adds to either C1 or C2. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent. Since there is no deuterium label, the only product from this pathway is **aniline**.\n\n**Execution of Step 4:**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.**\n*   **Position 2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.**\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, a C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than a C-D bond. This means two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Major Pathway (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at position 2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Minor Pathway (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is a slower process but still possible. The elimination of the bromide ion results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this intermediate is the non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the highly reactive triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from the major pathway):**\n    *   Attack at C1: The amino group attaches to C1, and subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6: The amino group attaches to C6, and subsequent protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from the minor pathway):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.

The use of isotopic labeling is a classic method to elucidate this reaction pathway.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from the position ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions with different isotopes: a deuterium at C2 and a hydrogen at C6.\n\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** The amide ion can abstract the hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, resulting in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** Alternatively, the amide ion can abstract the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This leads to the formation of a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this intermediate, the deuterium atom has been removed.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack and Product Formation:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n    *   **From the C1-C6 Benzyne (with Deuterium at C2):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The amino group attaches to C1.

The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion can abstract a proton (H) or a deuteron (D) from the positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, resulting in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at the C2 position remains in this intermediate. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from the C2 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is simply **benzyne**, with no deuterium.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A is favored, but both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-), acting as a nucleophile, then attacks the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n*   **From 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at C1: The NH2- group adds to C1. This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6: The NH2- group adds to C6. This results in the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **From benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2: Since this intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium, the addition of the NH2- group at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCounting the distinct organic molecules produced from all possible pathways, we have:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. This reaction can produce three distinct organic products.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how these products are formed:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine-bearing carbon. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can remove a hydrogen atom (H) from position 6. This is generally faster than removing deuterium due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond). This elimination of HBr leads to the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**, where the triple bond is between carbons 1 and 6, and the deuterium remains at position 2.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom (D) from position 2. This is a slower process but still possible. This elimination of DBr results in a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. This benzyne intermediate does not contain deuterium.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at carbon 1 leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at carbon 6 leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from the non-deuterated benzyne (from Pathway B):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) attacks the benzyne formed after the deuterium was removed.\n        *   Attack at either carbon 1 or 2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, results in the formation of **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, the three possible organic products from this reaction are 2-deuterioaniline, 3-deuterioaniline, and aniline.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python code successfully simulated the elimination-addition reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2).\n\nThe simulation followed these steps:\n1.  **Elimination:** Two different benzyne intermediates were formed. The first was created by removing a hydrogen atom, resulting in a benzyne with the deuterium atom still attached. The second was formed by removing the deuterium atom.\n2.  **Addition:** The amide nucleophile (NH2-) attacked each benzyne intermediate at the two possible positions of the triple bond.\n3.  **Product Identification:**\n    *   The first intermediate (with deuterium) yielded two products: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n    *   The second intermediate (without deuterium) yielded one product: aniline.\n4.  **Counting:** By collecting all the generated products into a set to remove duplicates, the code determined that there are a total of three unique organic products.\n\nThe final count of possible organic products is 3.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Abstraction of H from C6:** The amide ion removes the proton from position 6. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from position 1 results in the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium remains at position 3 relative to the new triple bond.\n2.  **Abstraction of D from C2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from position 2. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from position 1 forms a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate. The triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne:**\n    *   If the amide ion attacks C1, the final product after protonation is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   If the amide ion attacks C6, the final product after protonation is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Attack on benzyne:**\n    *   The attack of the amide ion on either carbon of the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation, yields only one product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes from both pathways, three distinct organic products are possible:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n1.  **Elimination Step:** The strong base, the amide anion (NH2-), abstracts an acidic proton from a position ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   The deuterium atom at the C2 position.\n    *   The hydrogen atom at the C6 position.\n\n2.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** This leads to two possible benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (Major):** Abstraction of the hydrogen from C6 is kinetically favored over the abstraction of the heavier deuterium isotope from C2 due to the kinetic isotope effect. This pathway leads to the formation of a 2-deuteriobenzyne intermediate, where the triple bond is between C1 and C6.\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor):** Abstraction of the deuterium from C2 leads to a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process.\n\n3.  **Addition-Protonation Step:** The nucleophilic amide anion then attacks the benzyne intermediates, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (2-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The amino group adds to C1. Subsequent protonation at C6 yields *ortho*-deuterioaniline.\n        *   Attack at C6: The amino group adds to C6. Subsequent protonation at C1 yields *meta*-deuterioaniline.\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (benzyne):**\n        *   Attack at C1 or C2: Since the deuterium was removed to form this intermediate, attack by the amide anion at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, results in the formation of non-deuterated aniline.\n\nCounting the unique products from all possible pathways, we have:\n1.  *ortho*-deuterioaniline\n2.  *meta*-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
