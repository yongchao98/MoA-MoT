A compound is chiral if its molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The double bond and the atoms directly attached to it (`Cl`, `H`, `C` of methyl, `C` of ethyl) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors (`3aR`, `7aS`, `E`), indicating that it is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   The core structure is a derivative of a norbornane system. The parent molecule without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group (i.e., with a `CH2` bridge) and with the `cis-endo` anhydride fusion is a meso compound, possessing a plane of symmetry.\n    *   However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` is `=CHCl`. Replacing the symmetrical `CH2` bridge with the unsymmetrical `=CHCl` group destroys the plane of symmetry.\n    *   The resulting molecule is chiral. Since the name specifies a single stereoisomer of a chiral compound, it will be optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). The configuration is given as `(2R, 3S)`.\n    *   This specific combination of stereocenters results in a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. In its staggered anti-conformation, this molecule has a center of inversion.\n    *   Meso compounds are optically inactive.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   The configuration is `(2R, 3R)`. This is a diastereomer of the meso form.\n    *   The `(2R, 3R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(2S, 3S)` isomer, are non-superimposable. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The compound named is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: `-OH`, `-H`, `-CH2-CH=` and `-CH=CH-CH2-`. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, so it is chiral.\n    *   The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all-`cis`).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. In its chair conformation with all three -OH groups in axial positions, the molecule has a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (`σv`).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butane chain. It is attached to a `-H`, a `-CH2-` group, and two `-CH3` groups. Since it is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It has accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, each compound must be analyzed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule is an alkene. The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this complex molecule includes specific stereochemical descriptors ((3aR,7aS)). This indicates that a single, specific enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer is by definition chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between these two carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral and its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, is non-superimposable. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. The designation of a specific enantiomer means the compound is chiral and optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This compound, also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has the three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposing CH2 group on the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** This ketone does not possess any chiral centers. The carbon in the chain bonded to two methyl groups (C3) is not chiral, and no other carbon atom has four different substituents. The molecule as a whole is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound step-by-step.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. This molecule has no chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The molecule itself is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer (an enantiomer). A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3. Such a compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair (the other being the (2S,3S) enantiomer). Therefore, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1, which is a chiral center (bonded to H, OH, C2, and C6, which are all different). Since a single enantiomer is specified, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation, but this does not make it achiral. Since it is not superimposable on its mirror image (the all-trans isomer), it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are 4 optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef count_optically_active_compounds():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are\n    optically active based on their structural properties and stereochemical descriptors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a meso compound.\n    # Chiral molecules are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    compounds_analysis = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\",\n            \"is_active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Achiral.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features to check for are chiral centers and elements of symmetry (plane of symmetry, center of inversion). If a molecule has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is achiral and thus optically inactive. Compounds with specific stereochemical descriptors (like R or S) are given as single stereoisomers.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: The molecule has a C=C double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond are sp2 hybridized. The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents) in this molecule. The molecule is planar around the double bond. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex, rigid bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The name itself provides the key information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (`3aR,7aS`) and the geometry of a double bond (`E`). This means the name refers to a single, specific stereoisomer. A molecule with chiral centers is chiral unless it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Given the complex and asymmetric substitution pattern, this molecule lacks any such symmetry elements.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the rest of the molecule). This allows for the possibility of a meso compound. The (R,S) combination for this particular structure is indeed the meso form. It possesses an internal plane of symmetry when viewed in the correct conformation (e.g., in its Fischer projection, there is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the (2R,3S) compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The (2R,3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. Together, they form an enantiomeric pair. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with an alcohol group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that all three groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This highly symmetric molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral (a meso-like compound) and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We check for chiral centers. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. No other carbon atom in the molecule is bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features leading to chirality are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. This molecule has no such carbon atom. The carbons of the C=C double bond are sp2-hybridized and cannot be stereocenters. The other carbons are either part of a methyl group or a methylene group (-CH2-), so they are not stereocenters either.\n    *   The molecule is essentially planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name explicitly defines the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E).\n    *   The designation of a specific configuration (R/S) means that the molecule has stereocenters and is being described as a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer (enantiomer) of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This complex, bicyclic molecule is not a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule has a symmetrical structure, with identical groups (COOH) at both ends and identical substituents (H, CH3) on the two central carbons.\n    *   When a molecule has two stereocenters and a symmetrical structure, the isomer with opposite configurations (R,S or S,R) is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have an internal element of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that makes them achiral, despite the presence of stereocenters. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are a pair of enantiomers. They do not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the (2R,3R) isomer is a chiral molecule. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the ring path `-C2H2-C3H=`, and (4) the ring path `-C6H2-C5H2-`. Since the two paths around the ring are different (one encounters the double bond sooner than the other), C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single stereoisomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring's average plane.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are each bonded to -H, -OH, and two ring segments. Due to the symmetrical substitution, the two paths around the ring from any of these carbons are identical (e.g., from C1, the path `-C2-C3(OH)-C4-` is identical to `-C6-C5(OH)-C4-`). Therefore, C1, C3, and C5 are not stereocenters.\n    *   The molecule has multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group). A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters (carbon with four different groups).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. The `-CH2-` carbon has two identical hydrogens. The `-CH(CH3)2` carbon has two identical methyl groups.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often occurs when a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, creating a chiral center. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity makes the molecule superimposable on its mirror image, so it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors *(3aR,7aS)*, which indicate specific configurations at chiral centers. A compound that is a single, specific enantiomer is by definition chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbon 2 and carbon 3). However, the substituents on both chiral centers are identical (H, CH₃, COOH). The *(2R,3S)* configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such compounds are called meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The *(2R,3R)* configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the *(2S,3S)* isomer. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a `-CH₂-CH=CH-` path around the ring, and a `-CH=CH-CH₂-` path. This makes C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the *(R)* enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule and thus optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has a highly symmetrical structure. The *cis*-isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring, possesses a plane of symmetry. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often caused by the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity gives the molecule a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS). These descriptors specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement at chiral centers. The naming of a specific, non-meso stereoisomer indicates that the compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the substituents on both chiral carbons are identical (a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, and a carboxylic acid group). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. This type of compound is known as a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule and has a non-superimposable mirror image, the (2S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at the first carbon atom (C1), which is a chiral center. The paths around the ring from C1 are different due to the double bond's position. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has its three hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry in the molecule, for instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon of a 3-methylbutanone chain. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule, so it is not chiral. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The entire molecule is planar, meaning it has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes specific stereochemical descriptors ((3aR,7aS,E)). This indicates that a single, specific stereoisomer is being described. Such a molecule is chiral, and as a single enantiomer, it will be optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two stereocenters. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with a center of inversion, which means it is achiral. This specific isomer is known as a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and is therefore a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at the first carbon, which is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to this carbon are -H, -OH, and two different carbon pathways around the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). The designation of a single enantiomer ((R)) means the compound is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom with four different groups attached. The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. No carbon in this molecule is a chiral center. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule lacks a chiral center and is achiral, thus it is not optically active.\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.

A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). However, molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such compounds are called meso compounds.

For example, a plane passing through any of the C-OH bonds and the opposite CH2 group is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and a `CH2` group, so it is not chiral. No other carbon atom is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the `C=O`, `CH2`, and `CH` groups, bisecting the two methyl groups and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nTo summarize:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond and does not possess any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters using (R) and (S) notations. This indicates that the molecule is a single, specific stereoisomer that is chiral. As a chiral molecule, it will be optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite the presence of chiral centers and thus optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry, and the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image (the (2S, 3S) isomer). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name indicates the (R) configuration at the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups (H, OH, and two different paths around the ring). Since a specific chiral enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this compound, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis). This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** An examination of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. A compound with stereocenters can still be achiral if it is a meso compound, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The carbons of the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The other carbons in the molecule (C3, C4, and the methyl carbon) are bonded to at least two identical hydrogen atoms, so they are not chiral centers either. The molecule lacks any chiral center or other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates the presence of specific stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other half of the molecule) are identical to the substituents on C3. The given stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (R and S), it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. Such a compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **achiral** and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters have the same configuration `(2R,3R)`. This molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Therefore, `(2R,3R)`-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name includes the descriptor `(R)`, indicating a specific stereoisomer. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group (-OH), a `-CH2-CH=` group (C2-C3), and a `-CH2-CH2-CH=` group (C6-C5-C4). Since C1 is a stereocenter and a specific enantiomer `(R)` is given, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is the all-*cis* isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. The designation `(1s,3s,5s)` refers to the absolute configuration of the stereocenters, which could also be named `(1S,3S,5S)`. This molecule possesses a C₃ axis of symmetry but lacks any improper rotation axis (Sₙ) or a plane of symmetry. Molecules belonging to the C₃ point group are chiral. Since a specific enantiomer is designated, it is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. Let's examine the molecule for stereocenters.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen atom, a methyl group (C4), another methyl group (the substituent), and a `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. The four groups are: H, CH₃, CH₃, and -CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. Wait, the parent chain is butan-1-one, and there is a methyl group at position 3. The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to:\n        1.  H\n        2.  CH₃ (the methyl group that is C4)\n        3.  CH₃ (the methyl substituent)\n        4.  -CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl\n    This interpretation is incorrect. The correct interpretation is that C3 is attached to H, C4 (a methyl group), C2, and a methyl substituent. Let's re-examine the structure from the name: The parent chain is butan-1-one, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A methyl group is at C3. So, the carbon skeleton is `C4-C3(CH3)-C2-C1`. The group attached to the carbonyl at C1 is a cyclopentyl ring. The full structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    Let's check C3 for chirality. The four groups attached are:\n    1.  H\n    2.  CH₃ (C4)\n    3.  CH₃ (the methyl substituent)\n    4.  -CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl\n    This is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the structure. The parent chain is butan-1-one. The methyl group is at C3. The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-`. The group attached to the carbonyl is cyclopentyl. So the structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    Let's check C3 again. It is attached to H, a methyl group, another methyl group, and the rest of the chain. This is wrong.\n    The correct structure for 3-methylbutane is isopentane. So, 3-methylbutan-1-one has the structure `(CH3)2CHCH2C(=O)-`. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to two methyl groups and is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive** (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Active**\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive**\n\nThere are four compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound (an achiral compound with chiral centers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis will determine how many of the seven listed compounds are optically active.\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms attached to the double bond lie in the same plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. The presence of these R/S designations indicates that this is a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral compound. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbons 2 and 3). However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, which can be seen when the molecule is in an eclipsed conformation, or a center of inversion in its anti-periplanar conformation. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a -CH=CH-CH2- portion of the ring, and a -CH2-CH2- portion of the ring. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and therefore optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The notation (1s,3s,5s) indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl-bearing carbon and the carbon atom opposite to it in the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this compound is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is in turn bonded to a 3-methylbutyl group. The chemical structure is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. There are no chiral centers in this molecule; the carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule as a whole is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nAn analysis of each compound is required to determine its chirality, which is the property that gives rise to optical activity. A molecule is optically active if and only if it is chiral (i.e., it is non-superimposable on its mirror image). A common indicator of achirality is the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The double bond makes the local geometry planar. The entire molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore **achiral**. It is not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors, `(3aR,7aS)`. This designates a single, specific stereoisomer. When a molecule with stereocenters is designated by its R/S configuration, it refers to a specific enantiomer (or diastereomer), which is chiral by definition (unless it's a meso compound, which would not typically be named this way). This compound is one of a pair of non-superimposable mirror images. Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` designation describes the meso isomer. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Drawing the molecule, for example in a Fischer projection, reveals a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n        CH3 - C - H   (2R)\n              |\n          H - C - CH3   (3S)\n              |\n             COOH\n        ```\n    *   This compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being (2S,3S)). Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name includes the stereochemical descriptor `(R)`, indicating a specific enantiomer.\n    *   The molecule has a chiral center at C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other part of the ring). The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This notation typically refers to the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This highly symmetric molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through any C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom (C4) bisects the molecule into two identical halves. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure can be determined from the IUPAC name: `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a chiral center (an atom with four different substituents). Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is the carbon at position 3 of the butane chain: `CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen, another carbon (`-CH2-CO-cyclopentyl`), and two methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since two of the attached groups are identical (the two methyl groups), this is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no other elements of chirality. It is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active (chiral) compounds:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Not optically active (achiral) compounds:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are **3** compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nA molecule will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key condition for chirality is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion within the molecule.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond and does not possess any chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar and therefore has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors \"(3aR,7aS)\", which explicitly define the three-dimensional arrangement at two chiral centers. A compound specified as a single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral and will be optically active. This complex bridged-ring structure does not have a plane of symmetry that would make it a meso compound. Therefore, it is optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule contains two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. This type of compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule is a diastereomer of the meso form described above. In the (2R, 3R) configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical activity. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The \"(R)\" designation in the name indicates a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This arrangement gives the molecule three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom of the ring. Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of the structure, CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl, reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, and no other carbon atom has four different substituents. The molecule is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to analyze the structure of each molecule to see if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule contains one or more chiral centers and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has the structure `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. There are no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups). The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. The presence of R/S notation indicates that the molecule has defined stereocenters and is a single, specific stereoisomer. Such a molecule is chiral unless it happens to be a meso compound. Given the complexity of this bridged system and its specific designation, it is chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the substituents on C2 and C3 are identical (H, CH3, COOH). The `(2R,3S)` configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry between the two chiral centers. This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. It is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule also has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. With the `(2R,3R)` configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry. The molecule is chiral, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The `(R)-` designation in the name explicitly states that the molecule is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. The chiral center is C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. It is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation (related to cis/trans) indicates that all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through C1 and C4). Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, making it optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n```python\ndef solve_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": {\n            \"active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Achiral.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a stereocenter and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `ClHC=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. The (Z) designation means the high-priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side. For C1, Cl > H. For C2, -CH2CH3 > -CH3. So, Cl and the ethyl group are on the same side.\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule has a double bond, so the atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n*   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n*   **Analysis:** The name itself provides the crucial information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the configuration of a double bond (E). The designation of a specific configuration like (R) or (S) means that the center is chiral. The compound is named as a single, specific stereoisomer. A single stereoisomer of a chiral molecule (an enantiomer) is by definition optically active. The only exception would be if the molecule were meso, but the complex and unsymmetrical nature described by the name makes this possibility extremely unlikely. A specific enantiomer is always optically active.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **optically active**.\n\n**3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n*   **Analysis:** This compound has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S). We need to check for internal symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond, and the two halves of the molecule are mirror images of each other. This is a classic example of a *meso* compound. Meso compounds have stereocenters but are achiral overall due to internal symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound, `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n*   **Analysis:** In this isomer, both stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **optically active**.\n\n**5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n*   **Analysis:** The name specifies the configuration at C1 as (R). This indicates that C1 is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to C1 are -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=CH-, and -CH2-CH2-CH=. The two pathways around the ring from C1 are different due to the position of the double bond, so C1 is indeed a stereocenter. A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name refers to a single enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **optically active**.\n\n**6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) implies a symmetrical arrangement, which corresponds to the all-cis isomer where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n*   **Analysis:** In its most stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups can occupy equatorial positions. This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true stereocenters because the two ring pathways from each are identical.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n*   **Analysis:** We must search for stereocenters.\n    *   In the `(CH3)2CH-` group, the CH carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it's not a stereocenter.\n    *   The `-CH2-` and `-C(=O)-` carbons are not stereocenters.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, all carbons are either attached to the carbonyl group or are -CH2- groups. The ring is symmetrically substituted. There is no stereocenter in the ring.\n    The molecule lacks any stereocenters and possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the C=O group and the `isobutyl` chain, bisecting the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, it is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. A molecule is achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   Structure: `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex name, but the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` are key. They specify the absolute configuration of two stereocenters. A compound with specific R/S configurations is a single stereoisomer.\n    *   This stereoisomer will be optically active unless it is a meso compound. A meso compound must have internal symmetry. For a compound with two stereocenters to be meso, the centers must have opposite configurations (e.g., R and S) and be stereochemically equivalent.\n    *   The ring system is a derivative of norbornane. The stereocenters 3a and 7a are the bridgehead atoms where the anhydride ring is fused. These positions are not stereochemically equivalent. Therefore, the molecule cannot be meso.\n    *   The name refers to a specific chiral molecule (a single enantiomer).\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The descriptors are (2R,3S).\n    *   This is a classic example of a meso compound. Due to the symmetrical nature of the molecule, the (2R,3S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry when viewed in an eclipsed conformation and a center of inversion in a staggered conformation.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The stereoisomer is (2R,3R).\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal symmetry elements (plane or center). It is chiral and has a non-superimposable mirror image, which is the (2S,3S) enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: H, OH, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` path, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry that pass through each C-OH bond.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Structure: `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for stereocenters. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. There are no other potential stereocenters in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the carbonyl group and the isobutyl group's backbone, bisecting the two terminal methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine how many of the compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often, but not always, involves the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The carbons involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp2-hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. There are no other carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. Therefore, the molecule has no chiral centers. Its mirror image is superimposable, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. These descriptors specify a single, specific enantiomer. By definition, a single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons C2 and C3. However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such compounds are called meso compounds. Despite having chiral centers, meso compounds are achiral overall and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. As a specific enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at the carbon atom C1, which is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different carbon pathways within the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). This makes C1 a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation, often equivalent to *cis*, indicates that all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry that each pass through a C-OH bond. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: Examining the structure, `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`, reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups. The carbonyl carbon is sp2-hybridized. No carbon in the cyclopentyl ring is attached to four different groups. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Yes**\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Yes**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Yes**\n\nA total of 3 compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule contains a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that would make it a meso compound.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself specifies a single, complex stereoisomer with designated chiral centers (3aR, 7aS). Such a complex, specifically defined enantiomer is not superimposable on its mirror image and lacks internal symmetry. Thus, it is chiral and optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, due to the (2R,3S) configuration, it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration means it is not superimposable on its mirror image, (2S,3S), and it lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name indicates the 'R' configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. Carbon 1 is bonded to a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). As a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The 's' notation is related to the 'cis' configuration, meaning the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and its carbon, bisecting the opposite C-C bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. Carbon 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the carbon chain. Because it has two identical substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the three compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.

The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at multiple chiral centers ((3aR,7aS,E)). This indicates that it is a single, specific stereoisomer. As it is not a meso compound, it is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry between the two chiral carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral. It lacks an internal plane of symmetry, and its mirror image ((2S,3S)) is non-superimposable. Therefore, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation \"(R)\" indicates a specific configuration at a chiral center (the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group). This specific enantiomer is chiral and thus optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has multiple hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry, making it achiral and not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this ketone's structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. Lacking a chiral center and any other element of chirality, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that are chiral and therefore optically active:\n1.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, C of ethyl) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   There are no stereocenters (chiral centers) in this molecule.\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS). When a specific stereoisomer is named with R/S designations, it refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral and optically active, unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. This typically occurs when the stereocenters have opposite configurations (e.g., R and S) and the substituents are arranged symmetrically.\n    *   The parent structure, hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (a norbornane derivative), is a meso compound. However, the presence of the `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent on the methano-bridge breaks this internal symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral. As the name specifies a single enantiomer, it will be optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (`H`, `CH3`, `COOH`, and the rest of the molecule) are identical to the substituents on C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as (2R, 3S). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations, it is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and are achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   Drawing this molecule in an eclipsed conformation reveals a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive** (meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound.\n    *   It has two identical stereocenters (C2 and C3), but this time they have the same absolute configuration (R,R).\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.

Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is an older form, generally indicating that all substituents have the same relative orientation, i.e., they are all `cis` to each other (all pointing \"up\" or all pointing \"down\" relative to the ring plane).\n    *   In a chair conformation, this corresponds to all three -OH groups being axial or all being equatorial.\n    *   This highly symmetric arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and not a stereocenter.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, no carbon is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   In the 3-methylbutyl chain, C2 and C3 are -CH2- groups. C4 is bonded to an H, a -CH2-CH2-(...) group, and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   Since there are no stereocenters and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality), the molecule is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry in certain conformations.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n- Optically active compounds: 2, 4, 5.\n- Optically inactive compounds: 1, 3, 6, 7.\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This molecular plane is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself specifies a single, specific stereoisomer using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notation for chiral centers (at positions 3a and 7a).\n    *   The presence of these descriptors indicates that the molecule has chiral centers. A specific stereoisomer with defined chiral centers is chiral unless it is a meso compound (an achiral compound with chiral centers).\n    *   Given the complex, asymmetric structure, it is not a meso compound. Its mirror image, the (3aS,7aR) isomer, would be non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereoisomer with the (2R, 3S) configuration is a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   In the case of (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, there is a center of inversion midway along the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   Because it is a meso compound, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   It is a diastereomer of the meso-(2R,3S) form.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a single enantiomer, it is chiral and lacks any internal symmetry elements.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the -CH2-CH= path (C2-C3), and 4) the -CH2-CH2-CH= path (C6-C5-C4). Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The 's' notation (syn) indicates they are all on the same side of the ring (all cis).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) perpendicular to the ring. It also has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`.\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The cyclopentyl ring consists of CH2 groups, none of which are chiral.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups, so it is not chiral.\n    *   C2 is a CH2 group, not chiral.\n    *   C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups (one is C4, the other is the substituent), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, C3 is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. It is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\nIn summary, the optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This molecule has no chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The plane containing the `C=C` double bond is a plane of symmetry for the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The name itself provides the key information. The designation `(3aR, 7aS)` specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. This indicates that the molecule is chiral and that we are considering a specific enantiomer. While some molecules with stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), the presence of the asymmetric `=CHCl` group on the methano bridge (C8) destroys any potential plane of symmetry that might exist in the parent ring system.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule has stereocenters and lacks internal symmetry. Therefore, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral center). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and are achiral, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound. It is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound, with the structure `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This is the (R,R) isomer. It is chiral and its mirror image is the (S,S) isomer. This molecule does not possess any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. It is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a six-membered ring containing a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path around the ring. Since the paths are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The designation `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation implies that all three groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the molecule into two identical halves.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butanoyl chain. However, C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-C(=O)-` group, and two identical methyl groups `(-CH3)`. Since two of the four groups are identical, C3 is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe compounds that are optically active are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers) and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's evaluate each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule is planar around the carbon-carbon double bond. This plane of the molecule is a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself specifies a single stereoisomer with defined absolute configurations (`3aR`, `7aS`) at its chiral centers. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This complex bridged structure lacks any internal symmetry elements that would make it an achiral meso compound. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two identically substituted chiral centers (at C2 and C3). The `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer has a center of inversion when in the staggered conformation and a plane of symmetry in the eclipsed conformation. This makes it a **meso compound**, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule and exists as one of a pair of enantiomers (its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer). Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: In this molecule, the carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and a `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral. The `(R)` designation indicates we are considering a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` designation indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all *cis*). This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We examine the molecule for chiral centers. The carbon atom in the isopropyl group `(CH(CH3)2)` is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. There are no other sp3 carbons with four different substituents. The molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (Yes)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (Yes)\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (Yes)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and possesses one or more chiral centers.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-*8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex molecule includes stereochemical descriptors (R, S, and E), which specify a particular stereoisomer. The presence of these descriptors indicates that the molecule has defined chiral centers and is a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-*2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3 (H, CH3, and COOH). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry between these two carbons. Molecules with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry are called meso compounds, which are achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-*2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. In the (2R, 3R) configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule is therefore chiral and will exhibit optical activity. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer.\n\n5.  ***(R)-*cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. The four different groups attached to C1 are the hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different carbon paths around the ring (-CH2-CH= and -CH=CH-CH2-). As a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-*cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation typically refers to the all-*cis* isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through an OH-bearing carbon and the opposite CH2 group) and a threefold axis of rotation (C3). Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. Carbon-3 is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, another methyl group (as part of the isobutyl group), and the cyclopentylcarbonylmethyl group [-CH2C(=O)Cyclopentyl]. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry and is chiral. Chiral molecules are capable of exhibiting optical activity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the four compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThus, a total of 4 compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis will determine the chirality of each compound listed.\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule is an alkene. Due to the double bond, the atoms directly involved are in the same plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule possesses two chiral centers. However, this particular stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, and its mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` form, is non-superimposable. Therefore, as a single enantiomer, it is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The `(R)` designation indicates a specific configuration at a chiral center (the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group). The presence of this single, specified chiral center makes the molecule a specific enantiomer, which is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This compound, also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement results in a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and optically inactive despite the presence of stereocenters.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** An examination of this ketone's structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atom in the butyl chain attached to two identical methyl groups is not chiral, and no other atom meets the criteria. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.

(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, each compound must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter, an atom bonded to four different groups. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** The structure is Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3. This molecule has no chiral centers. The carbon atoms of the double bond are sp2 hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The other carbons are also not attached to four different groups. The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters using (3aR, 7aS). The designation of a specific enantiomer (an R,S configuration) indicates that the molecule is chiral and exists as a single stereoisomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** Succinic acid is butanedioic acid (HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH). 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has chiral centers at C2 and C3. The (2R,3S) stereoisomer has an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are thus **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. As a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a -CH2-CH= group (C2), and a -CH2-CH= group (C6). The paths around the ring are different, making C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single, chiral stereoisomer. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The 's' notation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposite CH2 group, reflecting the other two hydroxyl groups onto each other. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon atom at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, making it **optically inactive**.\n\nIn summary, the optically active compounds are:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers), provided the molecule does not possess any internal elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)CH2CH3`. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex, bridged bicyclic molecule. The name explicitly gives the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E). This specification of a single stereoisomer of a molecule that lacks any obvious symmetry makes it chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. These stereocenters are equivalent (bonded to the same four types of groups). When a molecule has two equivalent stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making them achiral despite having stereocenters. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two equivalent stereocenters with the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any internal symmetry and is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: In this molecule, the C1 carbon (bearing the -OH group) is a stereocenter. It is attached to four different groups: -OH, -H, and two different carbon paths around the ring (-CH2-CH= and -CH2-CH2-CH=). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single pure enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This nomenclature indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This highly symmetric molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group) and a C3 axis of rotation. Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The systematic name describes the structure `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This is cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it has two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry in certain conformations. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nAn analysis of each compound for optical activity is required. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. Chirality is most often caused by the presence of one or more stereocenters, and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that would make the molecule superimposable on its mirror image (a meso compound).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has the structure Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The plane containing the C=C double bond acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors \"(3aR,7aS)\". These R/S designations indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific three-dimensional arrangement. Naming a specific enantiomer like this implies the compound is chiral and a pure sample of it will be optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. The (2R, 3S) designation indicates that the two chiral centers have opposite configurations. Due to the symmetrical nature of the molecule (the groups on C2 are the same as on C3), this specific diastereomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. In the (2R,3R) isomer, the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its enantiomer is (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The \"(R)\" in the name indicates that the molecule is a specific enantiomer. The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a vinyl group within the ring (-CH=CH-), and an alkyl group within the ring (-CH₂-CH₂-). As a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one of the C-OH bonds and the opposing C-H bond on the other side of the ring. Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. To determine if it is chiral, we look for stereocenters. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the -CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl group. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. No other atom in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione is **active**.\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **active**.\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is **active**.\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nOf course. Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine which of the compounds are optically active, followed by the Python code to summarize the result.\n\n### My thinking process:\nA compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a meso compound. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, a molecule with chiral centers can still be achiral if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such a compound is called a meso compound).\n\nI will analyze each compound based on these principles:\n\n1.  **`(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene`**: This is a planar alkene. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n2.  **`(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the molecule is a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound. A sample containing only one enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n3.  **`(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid`**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 are the same as on C3. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and not optically active.\n4.  **`(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid`**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It is chiral because it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image, which is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n5.  **`(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol`**: The `(R)` in the name specifies a particular configuration at the chiral center (C1, the carbon with the -OH group). Since this is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active. The carbon is chiral because the path around the ring in one direction (`-CH2-CH=`) is different from the path in the other direction (`-CH2-CH2-CH=`).\n6.  **`(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol`**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` designation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (e.g., all pointing up). This symmetric arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group, reflecting the other two C-OH groups onto each other. Because it has planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n7.  **`1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one`**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule. Since it is attached to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks chirality. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThree compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nHere is the Python code that formalizes this analysis and provides the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    Prints the analysis for each compound, the final count, and the correct multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping compound names to their optical activity status and the reason.\n    # True means optically active, False means not.\n    compounds_analysis = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": (\n            False,\n            \"Achiral: Molecule has a plane of symmetry and no chiral centers.\"\n        ),\n        \"(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\": (\n            True,\n            \"Chiral: The name specifies a single enantiomer (R,S designation), which is optically active.\"\n        ),\n        \"(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\": (\n            False,\n            \"Achiral (Meso): Contains chiral centers but has an internal plane of symmetry.\"\n        ),\n        \"(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\": (\n            True,\n            \"Chiral: This is a chiral diastereomer with no internal plane of symmetry.\"\n        ),\n        \"(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\": (\n            True,\n            \"Chiral: The name specifies a single enantiomer (R designation) of a chiral molecule.\"\n        ),\n        \"(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\": (\n            False,\n            \"Achiral: Highly symmetric molecule with planes of symmetry.\"\n        ),\n        \"1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\": (\n            False,\n            \"Achiral: No chiral centers exist in the molecule.\"\n        )\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of each compound's optical activity:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    active_count = 0\n    active_compounds = []\n\n    for i, (compound, (is_active, reason)) in enumerate(compounds_analysis.items()):\n        status = \"Yes\" if is_active else \"No\"\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {compound}\")\n        print(f\"   - Analysis: {reason}\")\n        print(f\"   - Optically Active: {status}\\n\")\n        if is_active:\n            active_count += 1\n            active_compounds.append(compound)\n            \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Total number of optically active compounds found: {active_count}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe optically active compounds are:\")\n    for comp in active_compounds:\n        print(f\"- {comp}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nBased on the options provided:\")\n    print(\"A) 3\")\n    print(\"B) 2\")\n    print(\"C) 4\")\n    print(\"D) 5\")\n    print(\"\\nThe correct option is A.\")\n\nsolve_optical_activity()\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Step-by-step analysis of each compound's optical activity:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral and is not present as a racemic mixture. The question asks which compounds *will* exhibit optical activity, which generally means we check for the chirality of the molecule itself. A molecule specified as a single enantiomer (e.g., (R) or (S) form) is optically active.\n\n**1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    The structure has a double bond between C1 and C2.\n    On C1: a Cl atom and an H atom.\n    On C2: a methyl group (-CH3) and an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    The (Z) designation means the higher priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side. Priority: Cl > H on C1; Ethyl > Methyl on C2.\n    ```\n       Cl     CH2CH3\n        \\   /\n         C=C\n        /   \\\n       H     CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common test is to look for a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    This molecule is essentially planar. All the carbon and chlorine atoms lie in the same plane. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It has no chiral centers (no sp3 carbon with four different groups).\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n**2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the name.**\n    This is a complex name for a bicyclic anhydride derivative. The crucial information is in the stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`.\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    These descriptors specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. When a compound is named as a specific stereoisomer (and it is not a meso compound), it refers to a pure enantiomer or a pure diastereomer. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active. While a compound with both R and S centers can be meso (like (2R,3S)-tartaric acid), the complex, unsymmetrical nature of this molecule, especially with the `(E)-chloromethylene` group, makes it overwhelmingly likely to be chiral. The specific naming implies a non-racemic, chiral substance.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is a specific chiral stereoisomer and is **optically active**.\n\n**3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    Succinic acid is a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid. 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has methyl groups on C2 and C3.\n    The stereochemistry is given as (2R, 3S). We can represent this with a Fischer projection.\n    ```\n           COOH\n            |\n    CH3 ---|--- H    (C2 is R)\n            |\n      H ---|--- CH3  (C3 is S)\n            |\n           COOH\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). However, there is a plane of symmetry that runs horizontally between C2 and C3, bisecting the C2-C3 bond. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half. A compound that has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry is called a meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    This is a diastereomer of the compound above. Both stereocenters have the R configuration.\n    ```\n           COOH\n            |\n    CH3 ---|--- H    (C2 is R)\n            |\n    CH3 ---|--- H    (C3 is R)\n            |\n           COOH\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    This molecule has two stereocenters. Unlike the (2R,3S) isomer, this molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral and its mirror image, the (2S,3S) isomer, is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair and is **optically active**.\n\n**5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    This is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    ```\n         OH\n        /  \\\n    (1)CH--CH2(2)\n      /      \\\n   (6)CH2      CH(3)\n     /        //\n   (5)CH------CH(4)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    The carbon at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter. It is attached to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. (Correction: The structure should be cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, so C2 and C6 are sp3, C3 and C4 are sp2). The two pathways around the ring from C1 are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n**6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis). In a chair conformation, this corresponds to all three being axial or all three being equatorial.\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C3 axis of rotation (rotating by 120° gives an identical molecule). It also has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of any plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    The name describes a ketone. The carbonyl group (`C=O`) is C1 of a butane chain. This C1 is also bonded to a cyclopentyl ring. There is a methyl group on C3 of the butane chain.\n    The structure is: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    We need to check for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    - No carbon in the cyclopentyl ring is chiral (each has two hydrogens).\n    - The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized, so not chiral.\n    - The CH2 carbon is not chiral.\n    - The CH carbon at position 3 of the chain is bonded to: 1) -H, 2) a methyl group (-CH3), 3) another methyl group (-CH3, the end of the chain), and 4) the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group.\n    Since this carbon is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no chiral centers and no other source of chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Final Count:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n1.

A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a single chiral center guarantees chirality, while molecules with multiple chiral centers can be achiral if they are meso compounds (containing an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This molecular planarity makes the compound superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex molecule includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E), which specify a particular stereoisomer. The 'R' and 'S' designations indicate the presence of chiral centers. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral and thus optically active.\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that makes them achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. Consequently, this molecule is not optically active.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R, 3R) configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being 2S, 3S). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at C1, which is a chiral center. The four groups attached to this carbon are different, and there is no internal plane of symmetry. As a specific enantiomer, this compound is chiral and optically active.\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This arrangement creates a plane of symmetry that passes through one of the C-OH bonds and the opposite carbon atom in the ring. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is an achiral meso compound and is not optically active.\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of the structure, which is (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)C₅H₉, reveals that there are no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to two identical methyl groups, making it achiral. The rest of the molecule also lacks any chiral elements. Therefore, the compound is achiral and not optically active.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nAn optically active compound is one that is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is most often due to the presence of one or more stereocenters and a lack of internal symmetry. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene***: This molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. Neither of the carbons in the double bond is a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry containing the atoms of the double bond, making it achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione***: The name itself indicates a specific stereoisomer with absolute configurations (3aR, 7aS) assigned to its chiral centers. The designation of a single enantiomer confirms that the molecule is chiral and thus **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the substituents on both chiral carbons are identical (a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, a carboxylic acid group, and the other chiral carbon). The (2R,3S) configuration results in a meso compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Meso compounds are achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: Like its diastereomer above, this molecule has two chiral centers. The (2R,3R) configuration is not meso and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer, and they are non-superimposable. Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  ***(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol***: The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. Carbon 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring due to the double bond's location. The specification of a single enantiomer means the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol***: The notation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule, despite having three stereocenters, possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv), which makes it achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one***: To determine if this compound is chiral, we must check for stereocenters. The structure is (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)-cyclopentyl. The only carbon atom that could potentially be a chiral center is carbon 3 of the butane chain, which is bonded to a hydrogen and two methyl groups. Since two of the groups attached to this carbon are identical (methyl groups), it is not a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, making it **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of stereocenters and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are key indicators of chirality.\n\n1.  ***(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene***: This compound is an alkene. The carbons of the double bond are not chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar and therefore has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione***: The name explicitly defines a specific stereoisomer with configurations (3aR, 7aS) at its chiral centers. Since a single, specific enantiomer is named, it is by definition chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such a compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters and are therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This compound also has two chiral centers. Unlike the (2R, 3S) version, the (2R, 3R) stereoisomer lacks a plane of symmetry and is part of an enantiomeric pair (the other being 2S, 3S). As a single enantiomer, it is chiral and optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol***: The name indicates the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. This specificity means it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, and thus it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol***: This compound, also known as cis-1,3,5-Cyclohexanetriol, has hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. Due to this high degree of symmetry, the molecule possesses planes of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one***: The structure of this ketone is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. An examination of the structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons), combined with an overall lack of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule has a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a plane. This planarity acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. The molecule does not have any chiral centers (sp3 carbon with four different substituents). Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides stereochemical information (`3aR,7aS,E`), indicating that we are considering a specific stereoisomer. The core structure, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, is a saturated norbornane-type skeleton fused with an anhydride ring. This parent skeleton is achiral (meso) due to a plane of symmetry. However, the substituent at position 8 (the methano bridge) is `=CHCl`. This `chloromethylene` group is not symmetric and its presence destroys the plane of symmetry of the parent skeleton. Since the molecule has designated chiral centers (`3aR, 7aS`) and lacks internal symmetry, it is a chiral molecule. As it's specified as a single stereoisomer, it will be optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3. The configuration is given as `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two chiral centers with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is often a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral because it possesses an internal element of symmetry (a plane or a center of inversion) that makes it superimposable on its mirror image. For `(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid`, there is a center of inversion halfway along the C2-C3 bond. Thus, it is a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. Both chiral centers have the `R` configuration. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. The `(2R,3R)` molecule is not superimposable on its `(2S,3S)` mirror image. It does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1. C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and =CH-CH2-CH2-. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies a single enantiomer (`R`). A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name refers to the stereoisomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all cis). This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not chiral centers because the path around the ring in one direction is identical to the path in the other direction.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon atom in the `CH` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no other sp3 carbons with four different groups in the molecule. The molecule is flexible, but it is fundamentally achiral and has conformations with a plane of symmetry. Thus, it is optically inactive.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically Active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n*   Optically Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons). However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond, leading to geometric isomerism (Z/E), but it does not have any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex molecule, but we are given its absolute stereochemistry via the descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E).\n    *   The presence of R/S descriptors indicates that the molecule has chiral centers (at positions 3a and 7a). The 'E' descriptor specifies the geometry of a double bond.\n    *   A specific stereoisomer of a molecule with chiral centers is optically active unless it is a meso compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The parent structure, hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, might be a meso compound (like the endo-Diels-Alder adduct of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride). However, the `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent (`=CH-Cl`), presumably on the methano bridge (C7 in norbornane numbering), breaks the potential plane of symmetry of the core structure.\n    *   Because the substituent destroys the internal symmetry, the molecule becomes chiral. The name specifies a single, resolved stereoisomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereoisomer with the (2R, 3S) configuration has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   A molecule with chiral centers but also an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R, 3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable (an enantiomeric pair).\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (one path around the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other path).\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This molecule has three OH groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The designation (1s,3s,5s) implies that all three groups have the same relative stereochemistry (all cis or all trans).\n    *   In the all-cis configuration (all OH groups pointing to the same side of the ring, e.g., all axial or all equatorial), the molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses several planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group).\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. It's worth noting that the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true chiral centers in this symmetric molecule (they are prochiral).\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Following IUPAC nomenclature, the parent chain is butan-1-one, with a cyclopentyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 3.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`. This can also be seen as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups, and the rest of the chain. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nAn analysis of each compound for optical activity is required. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and is not present as a racemic mixture. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is typically due to the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `CH₃CH₂(CH₃)C=CHCl`. This is an alkene, and all the atoms connected to the double bond lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` in the name specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The complex bicyclic structure with defined chiral centers (`3aR`, `7aS`) lacks any internal symmetry. A single enantiomer of a chiral molecule is by definition optically active. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3. However, the molecule is symmetrical in its connectivity. With opposite stereochemical configurations (`R` and `S`), an internal plane of symmetry exists between the two chiral carbons. This makes it a *meso* compound, which is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the above compound. Both chiral centers have the same configuration (`R`). This isomer lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is attached to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH₂-CH=` part of the ring, and (4) the `=CH-CH₂-CH₂-` part of the ring. This makes C1 a chiral center. The molecule is chiral, and the name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This isomer has all three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the ring (`all-cis`). This configuration results in a highly symmetrical molecule that possesses multiple planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`. This molecule does not have any chiral centers. The carbon in the isopropyl group `CH(CH₃)₂` is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group and its adjacent chain, making it achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in total.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral and must be present in a form that is not a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be achiral are the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes absolute configuration descriptors ((3aR,7aS)). This indicates that a specific stereoisomer is being described. For such a complex molecule, unless it is a meso compound (which is highly unlikely given the lack of symmetry in the name and structure), specifying a single stereoisomer means we have a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). We need to determine if the (2R,3S) stereoisomer is chiral or a meso compound.\n    Let's draw a conformation of the molecule. In the anti-periplanar conformation (staggered, with COOH groups opposite), there is a center of inversion halfway along the C2-C3 bond. The C2(R) configuration is opposite to the C3(S) configuration, the methyl on C2 is opposite to the methyl on C3, and the H on C2 is opposite to the H on C3. The presence of a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral. This is a **meso compound**, and it is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. They do not have any internal symmetry elements (like a plane or center of symmetry). The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R). Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and an alcohol group. The carbon atom bonded to the -OH group (C1) is a chiral center. Its four different substituents are -H, -OH, the ring path towards the double bond (`-CH2-CH=`), and the ring path away from the double bond (`-CH2-CH2-`). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has -OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 of a cyclohexane ring. There are two possible stereoisomers: one where all -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis), and one where two are on one side and one is on the other (cis-trans).\n    *   The all-cis isomer possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bonds. It is **achiral**.\n    *   The cis-trans isomer (e.g., OHs at C1 and C3 are up, OH at C5 is down) possesses a single plane of symmetry that passes through the C5-OH bond and the C2-H bonds. This is a **meso compound** and is **achiral**.\n    Since all possible stereoisomers are achiral, this compound is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The IUPAC name specifies a ketone where a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutanoyl group are attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`.\n    Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential chiral center is C3 of the butane chain. The four groups attached to C3 are:\n    1.  -H\n    2.  -CH3 (the terminal methyl group of the butane chain, C4)\n    3.  -CH3 (the substituent methyl group)\n    4.  -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl\n    Since two of the groups attached to C3 are identical methyl groups, C3 is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive. (Note: Even if the intended molecule was chiral, e.g., 1-cyclopentyl-2-methylbutan-1-one, the name does not specify a single enantiomer, so it would be a racemic mixture, which is also optically inactive.)\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive (achiral)\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active** (chiral, single enantiomer specified)\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso/achiral)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active** (chiral, single enantiomer specified)\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active** (chiral, single enantiomer specified)\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we need to assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. The compounds listed are specific stereoisomers, so we are evaluating each one individually. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image and typically lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  ** (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule itself is planar with respect to the atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them. This planarity acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ** (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself indicates a specific stereoisomer with defined absolute configurations (3aR, 7aS) at its chiral centers. A compound that is a single enantiomer of a chiral substance is by definition optically active. The complex bicyclic structure does not possess symmetry elements that would render it achiral.\n\n3.  ** (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, due to the (2R,3S) configuration, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3. Molecules with chiral centers that are overall achiral due to such symmetry are called meso compounds. Meso compounds are optically inactive.\n\n4.  ** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso-compound mentioned above. It has two chiral centers and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound.\n\n5.  ** (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon-1, which is a chiral center. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group is attached to four different groups, making it a stereocenter. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ** (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This notation typically refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule has multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group) and a C3 axis of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  ** 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** This ketone does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the isobutyl group and the cyclopentyl ring are not bonded to four different substituents. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is most often due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** The structure is Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. The molecule contains a double bond, and the atoms around it lie in a plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. The parent ring system is based on a norbornane-like structure, which is chiral. By naming a specific enantiomer, it confirms the compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the substituents on both carbons are identical (H, CH₃, COOH). The (2R,3S) configuration creates a plane of symmetry between the two chiral carbons. This type of compound is known as a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers and is therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso-compound above. In the (2R,3R) configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. Because it is chiral, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, indicating the compound is chiral. The carbon atom C1, which is bonded to the hydroxyl group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups (H, OH, -CH₂-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH₂-), making the molecule chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The nomenclature indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This highly symmetrical arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite C4 atom bisects the molecule into two identical halves. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. An examination of the molecule reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atom C3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, and no carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are asymmetrically substituted. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we must assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. Generally, a molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which often means it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  ***(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene***: The atoms connected to the carbon-carbon double bond lie in the same plane. This molecular planarity acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione***: The name itself specifies a single, complex enantiomer with defined stereochemistry at multiple chiral centers (3aR, 7aS). Such a molecule is inherently chiral and, as a specific enantiomer, is optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This molecule possesses two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry despite containing chiral centers, which renders them achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This is a diastereomer of the meso form mentioned above. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. As an enantiomer (the other being 2S, 3S), it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol***: The (R) designation indicates a specific configuration at the chiral carbon C1, which is bonded to four different groups. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral and optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol***: In this compound, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry in the molecule. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and its attached carbon, bisecting the ring. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one***: To determine chirality, we look for chiral centers and planes of symmetry. The molecule does not contain any chiral carbons. A plane of symmetry can be envisioned passing through the carbonyl group and bisecting the cyclopentyl ring, making the molecule achiral and optically inactive.\n\nTallying the results, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 compounds from the list will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Typically, this means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$) or a center of inversion ($i$).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:**\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n      Cl   CH2-CH3\n       \\ /\n        C=C\n       / \\\n      H   CH3\n    ```\n    This molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Any planar molecule is achiral.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:**\n    The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the molecule has stereocenters and a specific configuration is being described. A compound that can exist as a single, stable enantiomer is chiral. The name specifies one such enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). The substituents on both stereocenters are identical (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`, and the other `-CH(CH3)COOH` group). When a molecule has two stereocenters with identical substituents, the isomer with opposite configurations (R,S or S,R) is a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and are achiral, despite having stereocenters.\n    The (2R,3S) isomer is the meso form.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It is one of a pair of enantiomers, with its mirror image being the (2S,3S) isomer. Since it is a chiral molecule and is non-superimposable on its mirror image, it is optically active.\n    Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:**\n    The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at a stereocenter (C1). C1 is bonded to four different groups: `-H`, `-OH`, `-CH=CH-` (part of the ring), and `-CH2-CH2-` (part of the ring). A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name refers to a single enantiomer.\n    Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:**\n    This name describes the isomer where the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the ring (the all-`cis` isomer). Let's visualize this molecule in a chair conformation with all OH groups pointing \"up\". They would be in axial, axial, axial positions or equatorial, equatorial, equatorial positions. In either conformation, the molecule possesses high symmetry, including a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry that each pass through a C-OH bond. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:**\n    The structure can be deduced from the name: a cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon of a 3-methylbutanone chain. The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Let's check for stereocenters. The carbon `CH` is bonded to two identical methyl (`CH3`) groups, a hydrogen (`H`), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. The molecule has no other stereocenters and possesses a plane of symmetry in a symmetric conformation. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n-   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** Not optically active\n-   **(3aR,7aS,E)-...:** **Optically active**\n-   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** Not optically active (meso)\n-   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** **Optically active**\n-   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** **Optically active**\n-   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** Not optically active\n-   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** Not optically active\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity, we have 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if its molecules are chiral. Chirality is the property of a molecule being non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. This molecule is planar and therefore possesses a plane of symmetry, making it **achiral** and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The specific stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS) indicate a single, specific enantiomer of a complex, bridged molecule. A specific enantiomer is by definition chiral. This compound is **chiral** and therefore optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule, with the chemical formula `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`, has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry between the two centers. This makes it a **meso compound**, which is **achiral** and not optically active.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being 2S, 3S) and is **chiral** and optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name explicitly denotes a specific enantiomer, (R). Carbon 1 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, the alkenyl part of the ring, and the alkyl part of the ring). As a single enantiomer, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This nomenclature denotes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through a C-OH group) and is therefore **achiral**.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. An examination of the structure reveals no chiral centers. Carbon 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry and is **achiral**.\n\nCounting the compounds that are chiral and thus optically active:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nTo determine which of the given compounds are optically active, we need to assess the chirality of each molecule. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The presence of stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or a specific named enantiomer is a strong indicator of optical activity, unless the compound is meso.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze each compound for chirality:**\n    *   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a double bond. There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents). The molecule is planar and thus superimposable on its mirror image (achiral). It is optically **inactive**.\n    *   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself specifies a single, complex stereoisomer with (R) and (S) configurations. Such a molecule is a single enantiomer, which is by definition chiral and optically **active**. The structure is too complex and asymmetric to be a meso compound.\n    *   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric (HOOC- and -COOH at the ends). The (R,S) configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers. It is optically **inactive**.\n    *   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. Both chiral centers have the same (R) configuration. It lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Therefore, it is chiral and optically **active**.\n    *   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at C1. The carbon atom C1 is bonded to -OH, -H, -CH2-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH2- groups, which are four different groups. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound is chiral and optically **active**.\n    *   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This molecule possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and bisecting the opposite C-C bond. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. It is optically **inactive**.\n    *   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** Let's look for a chiral center. The structure is (cyclopentyl)-CO-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it's not a chiral center. No other carbon is chiral. The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **Count the optically active compounds:**\n    Based on the analysis, three compounds are optically active:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 3.\n\n```python\ndef solve_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": {\n            \"active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"This molecule is planar and has no chiral centers, making it achiral.\"\n        },\n        \"(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\": {\n            \"active\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"The name specifies a single enantiomer with R and S configurations.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups). A compound with chiral centers can still be achiral if it is a meso compound, which possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound.\n\n**1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n       Cl   CH3\n        \\  /\n         C==C\n        /  \\\n       H   CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule is an alkene. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbons of the double bond (C1 and C2) cannot be chiral centers. C3 (in the ethyl group) is a CH2, and C4 is a CH3, neither are chiral. The methyl group attached to C2 is also not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the double bond).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\n**2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n*   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS). These R/S descriptors are used to specify the absolute configuration of specific stereocenters in a single enantiomer. A compound that is designated as a specific enantiomer (like (R)- or (S)-) is by definition chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the name specifies a single, non-racemic enantiomer, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n**3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n*   **Analysis:** The name specifies the stereochemistry as (2R, 3S). Let's examine the symmetry of this stereoisomer. In this molecule, the two halves (from the center of the C2-C3 bond) are mirror images of each other. The molecule has an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    ```\n         COOH\n          |\n    H----|----CH3  (S)\n          |\n   CH3---|----H    (R)  <-- My assignment here might be off, but the relative R,S config makes it meso\n          |\n         COOH\n    ```\n    With (2R, 3S) or (2S, 3R) configurations, the molecule is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a meso compound, which is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** Same molecular formula as above, but with a different stereochemistry.\n*   **Analysis:** The stereochemistry is specified as (2R, 3R). This stereoisomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, and the two are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion:** As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, (2R, 3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **optically active**.\n\n**5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n*   **Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a -CH2-CH= group (path towards C2), and a -CH2-CH2-CH= group (path towards C6). Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center.

The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, in which case it is called a meso compound. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This molecule is an alkene. There are no stereocenters (sp³ carbon atoms bonded to four different groups). The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the carbon-carbon double bond and all atoms directly attached to it. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`, indicating that this is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer is by definition optically active, unless it happens to be a meso compound (an achiral molecule with stereocenters).\n    *   The complex bicyclic structure with the asymmetric `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent (`=CHCl`) lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Since it is a specific, asymmetric stereoisomer, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   This is a classic example of a meso compound. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry when the molecule is in the proper conformation (e.g., an eclipsed conformation, which is easily seen with a Fischer projection).\n    *   Because it is a meso compound, it is achiral despite having stereocenters. Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being (2S,3S)).\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   As a single, specified enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter. The four different groups attached to it are -H, -OH, the path `-CH₂-CH=` (towards C2), and the path `-CH₂-CH₂-CH=` (towards C6). The presence of the double bond makes the two paths around the ring non-equivalent.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the isomer where the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σᵥ). Each plane of symmetry passes through one `C-OH` group and the opposite `CH₂` group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   This molecule has no stereocenters. Carbon-3 of the butane chain is attached to two identical methyl groups.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This plane contains the `O=C-CH₂-CH` backbone and bisects the cyclopentyl ring. In a suitable conformation, this plane also reflects the two methyl groups into one another.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Optically active compounds:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The optical activity for each compound is determined as follows:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule lacks a chiral center and possesses a plane of symmetry within the plane of the double bond. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (3aR, 7aS).

However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers, and this specific stereoisomer (2R,3R) does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is one of a pair of enantiomers and is therefore optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the R configuration at the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1), which is a chiral center. As a specific enantiomer, this compound is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this compound, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule does not contain any chiral centers.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar with respect to the atoms of the double bond and their immediate attachments. This planarity creates a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself specifies a single, specific stereoisomer using the (R), (S), and (E) designations. The presence of these descriptors indicates the existence of chiral centers and a defined stereochemistry. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3. Such compounds are called meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry and is a chiral molecule. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is **optically active**. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center. It is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, the -CH=CH- part of the ring, and the -CH2-CH2- part of the ring. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and thus **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl-bearing carbon and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule symmetrically. Due to this symmetry, the compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this molecule is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. An analysis of the structure reveals that there are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. Therefore, the molecule has no chiral center and is **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and often contain one or more chiral centers. A specific enantiomer designated with (R) or (S) notation is, by definition, optically active. However, molecules with multiple chiral centers can be achiral if they have an internal plane of symmetry; such compounds are called meso compounds.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a double bond and the atoms involved in it lie in a plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n*   ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (R and S), indicating that it is a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is optically **active**.\n*   ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and thus optically **inactive**.\n*   ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form.

As a single enantiomer, it is optically **active**.\n*   ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation (R) specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups. Therefore, this compound is optically **active**.\n*   ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The 'cis' or 's' notation indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This symmetrical arrangement means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. As an achiral compound, it is optically **inactive**.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The most plausible structure for this name is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a single enantiomer (indicated by R/S descriptors) or the absence of any symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) indicates chirality and thus optical activity.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule contains a double bond, giving rise to (E/Z) isomerism, but it lacks any chiral centers (an sp3 carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule also does not possess axial or planar chirality. The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule if we consider the conformations of the ethyl group. More rigorously, any conformation will have a superimposable mirror image.\n    *   Thus, it is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The key information is in the stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`.\n    *   The `(3aR,7aS)` part specifies the absolute configuration at two bridgehead stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a. The presence of specific R/S descriptors for a single molecule indicates that we are dealing with a single enantiomer, not a racemic mixture.\n    *   For a molecule with multiple stereocenters to be achiral (a meso compound), the stereocenters must be related by an internal symmetry element, which would typically require them to have opposite configurations (e.g., R and S) and be structurally equivalent. Here, C-3a and C-7a are not structurally equivalent in the isobenzofuran ring system.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   The specific isomer is `(2R,3S)`. When the two stereocenters have opposite configurations (R,S) in a molecule with this type of symmetry, we must check for a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Drawing the molecule, for example, in a Fischer projection or a staggered conformation, reveals a plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3.\n    *   A molecule with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The stereocenters have the `(2R,3R)` configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. This pair constitutes a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the name specifies a single enantiomer `(2R,3R)`, it is a chiral substance and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the ring path `-C2H2-C3H=`, and the other ring path `-C6H2-C5H2-`. Because the paths around the ring are different due to the location of the double bond, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule containing only one stereocenter is always chiral.\n    *   The `(R)` designation indicates a specific enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups in a 1,3,5-relationship. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` typically refers to the highly symmetric, all-`cis` isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   In its stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups would be in equatorial positions.\n    *   This molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group opposite to it.\n    *   Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. It's a meso-like compound where the potential stereocenters (C1, C3, C5) are actually prochiral because the two ring pathways from each carbon are identical.\n    *   Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a butan-1-one parent structure. This is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. `C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)-`.\n    *   Substituents are a cyclopentyl group at C1 and a methyl group at C3.\n    *   Assembling the structure gives: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check this molecule for chiral centers. C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a C4-methyl group, a C3-substituent methyl group, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. The two methyl groups attached to C3 make it not a chiral center.\n    *   Let's re-examine the structure. The molecule is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the cyclopentyl ring and contains the C=O group, the C2(H2) group, and the C3(H) atom of the chain.\n    *   Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound.

The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` specify a single, specific stereoisomer. When a compound is named as a single enantiomer (using R/S or similar notation), it implies that the molecule is chiral and that this specific form has been isolated or synthesized.\n    *   While the parent ring system without the substituent at position 8 might have a plane of symmetry, the `=CHCl` group at this position breaks that symmetry.

(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    4.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound that is not present as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The key is to look for stereocenters and the overall symmetry of the molecule. If a name includes stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it refers to a specific stereoisomer, which will be optically active if the molecule itself is chiral.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `CH₃CH₂C(CH₃)=CHCl`.\n    *   This molecule is an alkene. There are no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=C double bond.\n    *   Conclusion: It is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself, with descriptors like `(3aR,7aS,E)`, specifies a single, precise stereoisomer.\n    *   The presence of these defined stereocenters in a complex, non-symmetrical structure indicates the molecule is chiral. Since a specific isomer is named, it is not a racemic mixture.\n    *   Conclusion: It is a specific chiral molecule and therefore **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. It possesses two stereocenters (C2 and C3).\n    *   However, the molecule's structure is symmetrical around the central C2-C3 bond. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: Meso compounds are achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The molecule is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer (its mirror image would be the (2S,3S) isomer).\n    *   Conclusion: It is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The carbon at position 1, which bears the -OH group, is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, and two different pathways around the carbon ring.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: It is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This compound has its three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry, including a C₃ rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry goes through one of the C-OH bonds.\n    *   Conclusion: Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   There are no stereocenters in this molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group and its attached chain.\n    *   Conclusion: It is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nTo determine if a compound is optically active, we need to assess its chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups), provided the molecule does not possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`\n    *   This molecule contains a double bond. The atoms involved in and directly attached to the double bond lie in a plane. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. There are no chiral centers.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral and optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   Structure: This is a complex bicyclic compound. The IUPAC name provides the absolute configuration for multiple stereocenters (`3aR`, `7aS`) and the geometry of the double bond (`E`).\n    *   When a specific stereoisomer (like a single enantiomer) is named, it is by definition chiral, unless it's a meso compound. Given the complexity and lack of symmetry in the core structure, and the specification of a single configuration, this molecule is chiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral and optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, with the `(2R,3S)` configuration, there is an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. The top half of the molecule is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   This is a classic example of a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral and optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral and optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) `-CH=CH-CH2-` (path one way around the ring), and 4) `-CH2-CH2-` (path the other way). This makes C1 a chiral center.\n    *   Since the molecule has a single chiral center and the name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, it is a pure chiral substance.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral and optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and bisecting the opposite C-C bond.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral and optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring)`\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers. The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH-` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it's not chiral. The `-CH2-` and carbonyl (`C=O`) carbons are not chiral. The cyclopentyl ring has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and passes through the center of the ring.\n    *   The entire molecule lacks any chiral centers and is symmetrical.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral and optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nA molecule will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally occurs in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Here's an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule lacks a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The nomenclature (3aR, 7aS) indicates the presence of specific stereocenters. Naming a compound with R/S designations signifies that it is a single, chiral enantiomer, which by definition is optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry due to the (R,S) configuration and the identical substituents on both ends (carboxylic acid groups). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The (2R,3R) configuration means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image (the 2S,3S enantiomer). As a specific enantiomer, it is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH=CH-, and -CH2-CH2-), making it a chiral center. The (R) designation specifies that it is a single enantiomer, which is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as *cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has multiple planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one hydroxylated carbon and the CH2 group opposite to it. The presence of these symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of this molecule's structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. The carbon in the butyl chain at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.

A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, and it is not a meso compound.\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This alkene does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with defined chiral centers ((3aR,7aS)). The designation of a specific enantiomer indicates the compound is chiral and, therefore, optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry within the molecule. This internal symmetry makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This stereoisomer also has two chiral centers. Unlike its (2R,3S) counterpart, it lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, indicating the presence of a chiral center at the carbon bearing the -OH group. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is more commonly known as *cis,cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol. Although it has stereocenters, the symmetrical arrangement of the three hydroxyl groups on one side of the ring creates planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this ketone's structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, meaning it lacks a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione is **active**.\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **active**.\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is **active**.\n\nIn total, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule contains one or more chiral centers and lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere's an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond.

Such a specific designation indicates that it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. Due to its complex, bridged structure, it lacks internal symmetry and is therefore **optically active**.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and, despite having chiral centers, are optically inactive.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. It has two chiral centers and lacks an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image, the (2S, 3S) isomer, is non-superimposable. Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The '(R)' in the name designates a specific enantiomer. The carbon atom attached to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. The molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image and is thus **optically active**.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This molecule has three stereocenters. However, the 'cis' arrangement (all hydroxyl groups on the same side of the ring) gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule does not contain any chiral centers.

A compound is chiral if its molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The double bond and the atoms directly attached to it (`Cl`, `H`, `C` of methyl, `C` of ethyl) lie in a single plane.

The parent molecule without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group (i.e., with a `CH2` bridge) and with the `cis-endo` anhydride fusion is a meso compound, possessing a plane of symmetry.\n    *   However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` is `=CHCl`. Replacing the symmetrical `CH2` bridge with the unsymmetrical `=CHCl` group destroys the plane of symmetry.\n    *   The resulting molecule is chiral. Since the name specifies a single stereoisomer of a chiral compound, it will be optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). The configuration is given as `(2R, 3S)`.\n    *   This specific combination of stereocenters results in a meso compound.

In its chair conformation with all three -OH groups in axial positions, the molecule has a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (`σv`).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butane chain. It is attached to a `-H`, a `-CH2-` group, and two `-CH3` groups. Since it is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It has accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, each compound must be analyzed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule is an alkene. The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this complex molecule includes specific stereochemical descriptors ((3aR,7aS)). This indicates that a single, specific enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer is by definition chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between these two carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral and its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, is non-superimposable. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. The designation of a specific enantiomer means the compound is chiral and optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This compound, also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has the three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposing CH2 group on the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** This ketone does not possess any chiral centers. The carbon in the chain bonded to two methyl groups (C3) is not chiral, and no other carbon atom has four different substituents. The molecule as a whole is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound step-by-step.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. This molecule has no chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The molecule itself is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer (an enantiomer). A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3. Such a compound is called a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair (the other being the (2S,3S) enantiomer). Therefore, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1, which is a chiral center (bonded to H, OH, C2, and C6, which are all different). Since a single enantiomer is specified, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation, but this does not make it achiral. Since it is not superimposable on its mirror image (the all-trans isomer), it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are 4 optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef count_optically_active_compounds():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are\n    optically active based on their structural properties and stereochemical descriptors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a meso compound.\n    # Chiral molecules are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    compounds_analysis = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\",\n            \"is_active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Achiral.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features to check for are chiral centers and elements of symmetry (plane of symmetry, center of inversion). If a molecule has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is achiral and thus optically inactive. Compounds with specific stereochemical descriptors (like R or S) are given as single stereoisomers.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: The molecule has a C=C double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond are sp2 hybridized. The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents) in this molecule. The molecule is planar around the double bond. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex, rigid bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The name itself provides the key information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (`3aR,7aS`) and the geometry of a double bond (`E`). This means the name refers to a single, specific stereoisomer. A molecule with chiral centers is chiral unless it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Given the complex and asymmetric substitution pattern, this molecule lacks any such symmetry elements.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the rest of the molecule). This allows for the possibility of a meso compound. The (R,S) combination for this particular structure is indeed the meso form. It possesses an internal plane of symmetry when viewed in the correct conformation (e.g., in its Fischer projection, there is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the (2R,3S) compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The (2R,3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. Together, they form an enantiomeric pair. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with an alcohol group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that all three groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This highly symmetric molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral (a meso-like compound) and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We check for chiral centers. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. No other carbon atom in the molecule is bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features leading to chirality are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. This molecule has no such carbon atom. The carbons of the C=C double bond are sp2-hybridized and cannot be stereocenters. The other carbons are either part of a methyl group or a methylene group (-CH2-), so they are not stereocenters either.\n    *   The molecule is essentially planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name explicitly defines the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E).\n    *   The designation of a specific configuration (R/S) means that the molecule has stereocenters and is being described as a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer (enantiomer) of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This complex, bicyclic molecule is not a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule has a symmetrical structure, with identical groups (COOH) at both ends and identical substituents (H, CH3) on the two central carbons.\n    *   When a molecule has two stereocenters and a symmetrical structure, the isomer with opposite configurations (R,S or S,R) is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have an internal element of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that makes them achiral, despite the presence of stereocenters. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are a pair of enantiomers. They do not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the (2R,3R) isomer is a chiral molecule. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the ring path `-C2H2-C3H=`, and (4) the ring path `-C6H2-C5H2-`. Since the two paths around the ring are different (one encounters the double bond sooner than the other), C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single stereoisomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring's average plane.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are each bonded to -H, -OH, and two ring segments. Due to the symmetrical substitution, the two paths around the ring from any of these carbons are identical (e.g., from C1, the path `-C2-C3(OH)-C4-` is identical to `-C6-C5(OH)-C4-`). Therefore, C1, C3, and C5 are not stereocenters.\n    *   The molecule has multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group).

The `-CH2-` carbon has two identical hydrogens. The `-CH(CH3)2` carbon has two identical methyl groups. No carbon in the isobutyl chain is a stereocenter.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, all carbons are `-CH2-` groups except for the one attached to the carbonyl group. This carbon is attached to the carbonyl, a hydrogen, and two `-CH2-` groups in the ring. The path around the ring is symmetrical. So, no carbon in the ring is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often occurs when a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, creating a chiral center. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity makes the molecule superimposable on its mirror image, so it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors *(3aR,7aS)*, which indicate specific configurations at chiral centers. A compound that is a single, specific enantiomer is by definition chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbon 2 and carbon 3). However, the substituents on both chiral centers are identical (H, CH₃, COOH). The *(2R,3S)* configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such compounds are called meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The *(2R,3R)* configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the *(2S,3S)* isomer. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a `-CH₂-CH=CH-` path around the ring, and a `-CH=CH-CH₂-` path. This makes C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the *(R)* enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule and thus optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has a highly symmetrical structure. The *cis*-isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring, possesses a plane of symmetry. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups.

This property is most often caused by the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity gives the molecule a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS). These descriptors specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement at chiral centers. The naming of a specific, non-meso stereoisomer indicates that the compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the substituents on both chiral carbons are identical (a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, and a carboxylic acid group). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. This type of compound is known as a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule and has a non-superimposable mirror image, the (2S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at the first carbon atom (C1), which is a chiral center. The paths around the ring from C1 are different due to the double bond's position. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has its three hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry in the molecule, for instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this ketone is a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon of a 3-methylbutanone chain. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule, so it is not chiral. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The entire molecule is planar, meaning it has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes specific stereochemical descriptors ((3aR,7aS,E)). This indicates that a single, specific stereoisomer is being described. Such a molecule is chiral, and as a single enantiomer, it will be optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two stereocenters. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with a center of inversion, which means it is achiral. This specific isomer is known as a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and is therefore a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at the first carbon, which is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to this carbon are -H, -OH, and two different carbon pathways around the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). The designation of a single enantiomer ((R)) means the compound is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This notation describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom with four different groups attached. The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. No carbon in this molecule is a chiral center. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule lacks a chiral center and is achiral, thus it is not optically active.\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral and are not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). However, molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such compounds are called meso compounds. When a compound is named with specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it refers to a single enantiomer, which is optically active by definition.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is an alkene.

It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric, with identical groups (COOH) at both ends.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (2R, 3S), meaning the two chiral centers have opposite configurations.\n    *   In a molecule with two chiral centers and identical ends, the (R,S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   This makes the compound a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is a meso compound and is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.

It is attached to four different groups: -OH, -H, a `-CH=CH-` path in the ring, and a `-CH2-CH2-` path in the ring.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration for this chiral center.\n    *   This means we are considering a single enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound is a single enantiomer and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `s` designation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the symmetry of this molecule. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) perpendicular to the average plane of the ring. It also has three vertical planes of symmetry (σv), each passing through a C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, even though carbons 1, 3, and 5 are stereocenters.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be achiral are the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule has a double bond. The atoms connected by the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.

The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E). These descriptors specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of R and S descriptors indicates the presence of chiral centers, and the molecule as a whole is chiral. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is not a racemic mixture. A pure sample of a single enantiomer of a chiral compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule that has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Such compounds with chiral centers that are overall achiral are called meso compounds. Meso compounds are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a different stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The (2R, 3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable. As a specific, single enantiomer, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom C1, which is attached to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (ring path), and -CH2-CH2- (ring path).

This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Let's examine the structure for any chiral centers.

This property typically arises from the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond and does not possess any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters using (R) and (S) notations. This indicates that the molecule is a single, specific stereoisomer that is chiral. As a chiral molecule, it will be optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite the presence of chiral centers and thus optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry, and the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image (the (2S, 3S) isomer). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name indicates the (R) configuration at the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups (H, OH, and two different paths around the ring). Since a specific chiral enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this compound, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis). This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** An examination of the structure reveals no chiral centers.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. A compound with stereocenters can still be achiral if it is a meso compound, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The carbons of the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The other carbons in the molecule (C3, C4, and the methyl carbon) are bonded to at least two identical hydrogen atoms, so they are not chiral centers either. The molecule lacks any chiral center or other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates the presence of specific stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other half of the molecule) are identical to the substituents on C3. The given stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (R and S), it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. Such a compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **achiral** and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters have the same configuration `(2R,3R)`. This molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Therefore, `(2R,3R)`-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name includes the descriptor `(R)`, indicating a specific stereoisomer. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group (-OH), a `-CH2-CH=` group (C2-C3), and a `-CH2-CH2-CH=` group (C6-C5-C4). Since C1 is a stereocenter and a specific enantiomer `(R)` is given, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is the all-*cis* isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. The designation `(1s,3s,5s)` refers to the absolute configuration of the stereocenters, which could also be named `(1S,3S,5S)`. This molecule possesses a C₃ axis of symmetry but lacks any improper rotation axis (Sₙ) or a plane of symmetry. Molecules belonging to the C₃ point group are chiral. Since a specific enantiomer is designated, it is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. Let's examine the molecule for stereocenters.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen atom, a methyl group (C4), another methyl group (the substituent), and a `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. The four groups are: H, CH₃, CH₃, and -CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. Wait, the parent chain is butan-1-one, and there is a methyl group at position 3. The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to:\n        1.  H\n        2.  CH₃ (the methyl group that is C4)\n        3.  CH₃ (the methyl substituent)\n        4.  -CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl\n    This interpretation is incorrect. The correct interpretation is that C3 is attached to H, C4 (a methyl group), C2, and a methyl substituent. Let's re-examine the structure from the name: The parent chain is butan-1-one, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A methyl group is at C3. So, the carbon skeleton is `C4-C3(CH3)-C2-C1`. The group attached to the carbonyl at C1 is a cyclopentyl ring. The full structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    Let's check C3 for chirality. The four groups attached are:\n    1.  H\n    2.  CH₃ (C4)\n    3.  CH₃ (the methyl substituent)\n    4.  -CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl\n    This is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the structure. The parent chain is butan-1-one. The methyl group is at C3. The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-`. The group attached to the carbonyl is cyclopentyl. So the structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    Let's check C3 again. It is attached to H, a methyl group, another methyl group, and the rest of the chain. This is wrong.\n    The correct structure for 3-methylbutane is isopentane. So, 3-methylbutan-1-one has the structure `(CH3)2CHCH2C(=O)-`. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to two methyl groups and is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive** (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Active**\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive**\n\nThere are four compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound (an achiral compound with chiral centers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis will determine how many of the seven listed compounds are optically active.\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms attached to the double bond lie in the same plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. The presence of these R/S designations indicates that this is a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral compound. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbons 2 and 3). However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, which can be seen when the molecule is in an eclipsed conformation, or a center of inversion in its anti-periplanar conformation. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a -CH=CH-CH2- portion of the ring, and a -CH2-CH2- portion of the ring. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and therefore optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The notation (1s,3s,5s) indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl-bearing carbon and the carbon atom opposite to it in the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this compound is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is in turn bonded to a 3-methylbutyl group. The chemical structure is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. There are no chiral centers in this molecule; the carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule as a whole is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nAn analysis of each compound is required to determine its chirality, which is the property that gives rise to optical activity. A molecule is optically active if and only if it is chiral (i.e., it is non-superimposable on its mirror image). A common indicator of achirality is the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The double bond makes the local geometry planar. The entire molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore **achiral**. It is not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors, `(3aR,7aS)`. This designates a single, specific stereoisomer. When a molecule with stereocenters is designated by its R/S configuration, it refers to a specific enantiomer (or diastereomer), which is chiral by definition (unless it's a meso compound, which would not typically be named this way). This compound is one of a pair of non-superimposable mirror images. Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` designation describes the meso isomer. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Drawing the molecule, for example in a Fischer projection, reveals a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n             COOH\n              |\n        CH3 - C - H   (2R)\n              |\n          H - C - CH3   (3S)\n              |\n             COOH\n        ```\n    *   This compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being (2S,3S)). Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name includes the stereochemical descriptor `(R)`, indicating a specific enantiomer.\n    *   The molecule has a chiral center at C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other part of the ring). The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This notation typically refers to the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This highly symmetric molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through any C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom (C4) bisects the molecule into two identical halves. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure can be determined from the IUPAC name: `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a chiral center (an atom with four different substituents). Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is the carbon at position 3 of the butane chain: `CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen, another carbon (`-CH2-CO-cyclopentyl`), and two methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since two of the attached groups are identical (the two methyl groups), this is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no other elements of chirality. It is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active (chiral) compounds:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Not optically active (achiral) compounds:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are **3** compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nA molecule will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key condition for chirality is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion within the molecule.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond and does not possess any chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar and therefore has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors \"(3aR,7aS)\", which explicitly define the three-dimensional arrangement at two chiral centers. A compound specified as a single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral and will be optically active. This complex bridged-ring structure does not have a plane of symmetry that would make it a meso compound. Therefore, it is optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule contains two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. This type of compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule is a diastereomer of the meso form described above. In the (2R, 3R) configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical activity. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The \"(R)\" designation in the name indicates a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This arrangement gives the molecule three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom of the ring. Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of the structure, CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl, reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, and no other carbon atom has four different substituents. The molecule is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to analyze the structure of each molecule to see if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule contains one or more chiral centers and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has the structure `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. There are no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups). The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. The presence of R/S notation indicates that the molecule has defined stereocenters and is a single, specific stereoisomer. Such a molecule is chiral unless it happens to be a meso compound. Given the complexity of this bridged system and its specific designation, it is chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the substituents on C2 and C3 are identical (H, CH3, COOH). The `(2R,3S)` configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry between the two chiral centers. This is a classic example of a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. It is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule also has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. With the `(2R,3R)` configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry. The molecule is chiral, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The `(R)-` designation in the name explicitly states that the molecule is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. The chiral center is C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. It is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation (related to cis/trans) indicates that all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through C1 and C4). Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, making it optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n```python\ndef solve_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": {\n            \"active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Achiral.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a stereocenter and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `ClHC=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. The (Z) designation means the high-priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side. For C1, Cl > H. For C2, -CH2CH3 > -CH3. So, Cl and the ethyl group are on the same side.\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule has a double bond, so the atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n*   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n*   **Analysis:** The name itself provides the crucial information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the configuration of a double bond (E). The designation of a specific configuration like (R) or (S) means that the center is chiral. The compound is named as a single, specific stereoisomer. A single stereoisomer of a chiral molecule (an enantiomer) is by definition optically active. The only exception would be if the molecule were meso, but the complex and unsymmetrical nature described by the name makes this possibility extremely unlikely. A specific enantiomer is always optically active.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **optically active**.\n\n**3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n*   **Analysis:** This compound has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S). We need to check for internal symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond, and the two halves of the molecule are mirror images of each other. This is a classic example of a *meso* compound. Meso compounds have stereocenters but are achiral overall due to internal symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound, `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n*   **Analysis:** In this isomer, both stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **optically active**.\n\n**5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n*   **Analysis:** The name specifies the configuration at C1 as (R). This indicates that C1 is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to C1 are -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=CH-, and -CH2-CH2-CH=. The two pathways around the ring from C1 are different due to the position of the double bond, so C1 is indeed a stereocenter. A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name refers to a single enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **optically active**.\n\n**6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) implies a symmetrical arrangement, which corresponds to the all-cis isomer where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n*   **Analysis:** In its most stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups can occupy equatorial positions. This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true stereocenters because the two ring pathways from each are identical.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n*   **Analysis:** We must search for stereocenters.\n    *   In the `(CH3)2CH-` group, the CH carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it's not a stereocenter.\n    *   The `-CH2-` and `-C(=O)-` carbons are not stereocenters.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, all carbons are either attached to the carbonyl group or are -CH2- groups. The ring is symmetrically substituted. There is no stereocenter in the ring.\n    The molecule lacks any stereocenters and possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the C=O group and the `isobutyl` chain, bisecting the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, it is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n1.

The most common source of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. A molecule is achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   Structure: `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex name, but the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` are key. They specify the absolute configuration of two stereocenters. A compound with specific R/S configurations is a single stereoisomer.\n    *   This stereoisomer will be optically active unless it is a meso compound. A meso compound must have internal symmetry. For a compound with two stereocenters to be meso, the centers must have opposite configurations (e.g., R and S) and be stereochemically equivalent.\n    *   The ring system is a derivative of norbornane. The stereocenters 3a and 7a are the bridgehead atoms where the anhydride ring is fused. These positions are not stereochemically equivalent. Therefore, the molecule cannot be meso.\n    *   The name refers to a specific chiral molecule (a single enantiomer).\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The descriptors are (2R,3S).\n    *   This is a classic example of a meso compound. Due to the symmetrical nature of the molecule, the (2R,3S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry when viewed in an eclipsed conformation and a center of inversion in a staggered conformation.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The stereoisomer is (2R,3R).\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal symmetry elements (plane or center). It is chiral and has a non-superimposable mirror image, which is the (2S,3S) enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: H, OH, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` path, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry that pass through each C-OH bond.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Structure: `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for stereocenters. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. There are no other potential stereocenters in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the carbonyl group and the isobutyl group's backbone, bisecting the two terminal methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine how many of the compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often, but not always, involves the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The carbons involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp2-hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. There are no other carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. Therefore, the molecule has no chiral centers. Its mirror image is superimposable, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. These descriptors specify a single, specific enantiomer. By definition, a single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons C2 and C3. However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such compounds are called meso compounds. Despite having chiral centers, meso compounds are achiral overall and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. As a specific enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at the carbon atom C1, which is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different carbon pathways within the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). This makes C1 a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation, often equivalent to *cis*, indicates that all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry that each pass through a C-OH bond. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: Examining the structure, `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`, reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups. The carbonyl carbon is sp2-hybridized. No carbon in the cyclopentyl ring is attached to four different groups. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Yes**\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Yes**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Yes**\n\nA total of 3 compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule contains a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that would make it a meso compound.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself specifies a single, complex stereoisomer with designated chiral centers (3aR, 7aS). Such a complex, specifically defined enantiomer is not superimposable on its mirror image and lacks internal symmetry. Thus, it is chiral and optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, due to the (2R,3S) configuration, it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration means it is not superimposable on its mirror image, (2S,3S), and it lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name indicates the 'R' configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. Carbon 1 is bonded to a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). As a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The 's' notation is related to the 'cis' configuration, meaning the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and its carbon, bisecting the opposite C-C bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. Carbon 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the carbon chain. Because it has two identical substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the three compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.

However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry between the two chiral carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral. It lacks an internal plane of symmetry, and its mirror image ((2S,3S)) is non-superimposable. Therefore, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation \"(R)\" indicates a specific configuration at a chiral center (the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group). This specific enantiomer is chiral and thus optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has multiple hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry, making it achiral and not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this ketone's structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. Lacking a chiral center and any other element of chirality, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that are chiral and therefore optically active:\n1.

The designation `(3aR, 7aS)` specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. This indicates that the molecule is chiral and that we are considering a specific enantiomer. While some molecules with stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), the presence of the asymmetric `=CHCl` group on the methano bridge (C8) destroys any potential plane of symmetry that might exist in the parent ring system.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule has stereocenters and lacks internal symmetry. Therefore, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral center). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and are achiral, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound. It is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound, with the structure `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This is the (R,R) isomer. It is chiral and its mirror image is the (S,S) isomer. This molecule does not possess any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. It is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a six-membered ring containing a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path around the ring. Since the paths are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The designation `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation implies that all three groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the molecule into two identical halves.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butanoyl chain. However, C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-C(=O)-` group, and two identical methyl groups `(-CH3)`. Since two of the four groups are identical, C3 is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe compounds that are optically active are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers) and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's evaluate each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule is planar around the carbon-carbon double bond. This plane of the molecule is a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself specifies a single stereoisomer with defined absolute configurations (`3aR`, `7aS`) at its chiral centers. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This complex bridged structure lacks any internal symmetry elements that would make it an achiral meso compound. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two identically substituted chiral centers (at C2 and C3). The `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer has a center of inversion when in the staggered conformation and a plane of symmetry in the eclipsed conformation. This makes it a **meso compound**, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule and exists as one of a pair of enantiomers (its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer). Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: In this molecule, the carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and a `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral. The `(R)` designation indicates we are considering a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` designation indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all *cis*). This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We examine the molecule for chiral centers. The carbon atom in the isopropyl group `(CH(CH3)2)` is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. There are no other sp3 carbons with four different substituents. The molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (Yes)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (Yes)\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (Yes)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and possesses one or more chiral centers.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-*8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex molecule includes stereochemical descriptors (R, S, and E), which specify a particular stereoisomer. The presence of these descriptors indicates that the molecule has defined chiral centers and is a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-*2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3 (H, CH3, and COOH). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry between these two carbons. Molecules with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry are called meso compounds, which are achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-*2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. In the (2R, 3R) configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule is therefore chiral and will exhibit optical activity. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer.\n\n5.  ***(R)-*cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. The four different groups attached to C1 are the hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different carbon paths around the ring (-CH2-CH= and -CH=CH-CH2-). As a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-*cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation typically refers to the all-*cis* isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through an OH-bearing carbon and the opposite CH2 group) and a threefold axis of rotation (C3). Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. Carbon-3 is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, another methyl group (as part of the isobutyl group), and the cyclopentylcarbonylmethyl group [-CH2C(=O)Cyclopentyl]. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry and is chiral. Chiral molecules are capable of exhibiting optical activity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the four compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThus, a total of 4 compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis will determine the chirality of each compound listed.\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule is an alkene. Due to the double bond, the atoms directly involved are in the same plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule possesses two chiral centers. However, this particular stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, and its mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` form, is non-superimposable. Therefore, as a single enantiomer, it is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The `(R)` designation indicates a specific configuration at a chiral center (the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group). The presence of this single, specified chiral center makes the molecule a specific enantiomer, which is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This compound, also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement results in a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and optically inactive despite the presence of stereocenters.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** An examination of this ketone's structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atom in the butyl chain attached to two identical methyl groups is not chiral, and no other atom meets the criteria. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, each compound must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter, an atom bonded to four different groups. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** The structure is Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3. This molecule has no chiral centers. The carbon atoms of the double bond are sp2 hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The other carbons are also not attached to four different groups. The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters using (3aR, 7aS). The designation of a specific enantiomer (an R,S configuration) indicates that the molecule is chiral and exists as a single stereoisomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** Succinic acid is butanedioic acid (HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH). 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has chiral centers at C2 and C3. The (2R,3S) stereoisomer has an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are thus **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. As a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a -CH2-CH= group (C2), and a -CH2-CH= group (C6). The paths around the ring are different, making C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single, chiral stereoisomer. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The 's' notation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposite CH2 group, reflecting the other two hydroxyl groups onto each other. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon atom at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, making it **optically inactive**.\n\nIn summary, the optically active compounds are:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers), provided the molecule does not possess any internal elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)CH2CH3`. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex, bridged bicyclic molecule. The name explicitly gives the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E). This specification of a single stereoisomer of a molecule that lacks any obvious symmetry makes it chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. These stereocenters are equivalent (bonded to the same four types of groups). When a molecule has two equivalent stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making them achiral despite having stereocenters. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two equivalent stereocenters with the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any internal symmetry and is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: In this molecule, the C1 carbon (bearing the -OH group) is a stereocenter. It is attached to four different groups: -OH, -H, and two different carbon paths around the ring (-CH2-CH= and -CH2-CH2-CH=). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single pure enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This nomenclature indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This highly symmetric molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group) and a C3 axis of rotation. Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The systematic name describes the structure `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This is cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it has two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry in certain conformations. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nAn analysis of each compound for optical activity is required. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. Chirality is most often caused by the presence of one or more stereocenters, and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that would make the molecule superimposable on its mirror image (a meso compound).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has the structure Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The plane containing the C=C double bond acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors \"(3aR,7aS)\". These R/S designations indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific three-dimensional arrangement. Naming a specific enantiomer like this implies the compound is chiral and a pure sample of it will be optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. The (2R, 3S) designation indicates that the two chiral centers have opposite configurations. Due to the symmetrical nature of the molecule (the groups on C2 are the same as on C3), this specific diastereomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. In the (2R,3R) isomer, the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its enantiomer is (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The \"(R)\" in the name indicates that the molecule is a specific enantiomer. The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a vinyl group within the ring (-CH=CH-), and an alkyl group within the ring (-CH₂-CH₂-). As a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one of the C-OH bonds and the opposing C-H bond on the other side of the ring. Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. To determine if it is chiral, we look for stereocenters. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the -CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl group. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. No other atom in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione is **active**.\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **active**.\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is **active**.\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nOf course. Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine which of the compounds are optically active, followed by the Python code to summarize the result.\n\n### My thinking process:\nA compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a meso compound. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, a molecule with chiral centers can still be achiral if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such a compound is called a meso compound).\n\nI will analyze each compound based on these principles:\n\n1.  **`(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene`**: This is a planar alkene. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n2.  **`(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the molecule is a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound. A sample containing only one enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n3.  **`(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid`**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 are the same as on C3. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and not optically active.\n4.  **`(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid`**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It is chiral because it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image, which is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically active.\n5.  **`(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol`**: The `(R)` in the name specifies a particular configuration at the chiral center (C1, the carbon with the -OH group). Since this is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active. The carbon is chiral because the path around the ring in one direction (`-CH2-CH=`) is different from the path in the other direction (`-CH2-CH2-CH=`).\n6.  **`(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol`**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` designation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (e.g., all pointing up). This symmetric arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group, reflecting the other two C-OH groups onto each other. Because it has planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n7.  **`1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one`**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule. Since it is attached to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks chirality. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThree compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nHere is the Python code that formalizes this analysis and provides the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    Prints the analysis for each compound, the final count, and the correct multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping compound names to their optical activity status and the reason.\n    # True means optically active, False means not.\n    compounds_analysis = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": (\n            False,\n            \"Achiral: Molecule has a plane of symmetry and no chiral centers.\"\n        ),\n        \"(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\": (\n            True,\n            \"Chiral: The name specifies a single enantiomer (R,S designation), which is optically active.\"\n        ),\n        \"(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\": (\n            False,\n            \"Achiral (Meso): Contains chiral centers but has an internal plane of symmetry.\"\n        ),\n        \"(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\": (\n            True,\n            \"Chiral: This is a chiral diastereomer with no internal plane of symmetry.\"\n        ),\n        \"(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\": (\n            True,\n            \"Chiral: The name specifies a single enantiomer (R designation) of a chiral molecule.\"\n        ),\n        \"(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\": (\n            False,\n            \"Achiral: Highly symmetric molecule with planes of symmetry.\"\n        ),\n        \"1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\": (\n            False,\n            \"Achiral: No chiral centers exist in the molecule.\"\n        )\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of each compound's optical activity:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    active_count = 0\n    active_compounds = []\n\n    for i, (compound, (is_active, reason)) in enumerate(compounds_analysis.items()):\n        status = \"Yes\" if is_active else \"No\"\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {compound}\")\n        print(f\"   - Analysis: {reason}\")\n        print(f\"   - Optically Active: {status}\\n\")\n        if is_active:\n            active_count += 1\n            active_compounds.append(compound)\n            \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Total number of optically active compounds found: {active_count}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe optically active compounds are:\")\n    for comp in active_compounds:\n        print(f\"- {comp}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nBased on the options provided:\")\n    print(\"A) 3\")\n    print(\"B) 2\")\n    print(\"C) 4\")\n    print(\"D) 5\")\n    print(\"\\nThe correct option is A.\")\n\nsolve_optical_activity()\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Step-by-step analysis of each compound's optical activity:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral and is not present as a racemic mixture. The question asks which compounds *will* exhibit optical activity, which generally means we check for the chirality of the molecule itself. A molecule specified as a single enantiomer (e.g., (R) or (S) form) is optically active.\n\n**1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    The structure has a double bond between C1 and C2.\n    On C1: a Cl atom and an H atom.\n    On C2: a methyl group (-CH3) and an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    The (Z) designation means the higher priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side. Priority: Cl > H on C1; Ethyl > Methyl on C2.\n    ```\n       Cl     CH2CH3\n        \\   /\n         C=C\n        /   \\\n       H     CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common test is to look for a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    This molecule is essentially planar. All the carbon and chlorine atoms lie in the same plane. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It has no chiral centers (no sp3 carbon with four different groups).\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n**2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the name.**\n    This is a complex name for a bicyclic anhydride derivative. The crucial information is in the stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`.\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    These descriptors specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. When a compound is named as a specific stereoisomer (and it is not a meso compound), it refers to a pure enantiomer or a pure diastereomer. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active. While a compound with both R and S centers can be meso (like (2R,3S)-tartaric acid), the complex, unsymmetrical nature of this molecule, especially with the `(E)-chloromethylene` group, makes it overwhelmingly likely to be chiral. The specific naming implies a non-racemic, chiral substance.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is a specific chiral stereoisomer and is **optically active**.\n\n**3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    Succinic acid is a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid. 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has methyl groups on C2 and C3.\n    The stereochemistry is given as (2R, 3S). We can represent this with a Fischer projection.\n    ```\n           COOH\n            |\n    CH3 ---|--- H    (C2 is R)\n            |\n      H ---|--- CH3  (C3 is S)\n            |\n           COOH\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). However, there is a plane of symmetry that runs horizontally between C2 and C3, bisecting the C2-C3 bond. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half. A compound that has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry is called a meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    This is a diastereomer of the compound above. Both stereocenters have the R configuration.\n    ```\n           COOH\n            |\n    CH3 ---|--- H    (C2 is R)\n            |\n    CH3 ---|--- H    (C3 is R)\n            |\n           COOH\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    This molecule has two stereocenters. Unlike the (2R,3S) isomer, this molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral and its mirror image, the (2S,3S) isomer, is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral pair and is **optically active**.\n\n**5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    This is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    ```\n         OH\n        /  \\\n    (1)CH--CH2(2)\n      /      \\\n   (6)CH2      CH(3)\n     /        //\n   (5)CH------CH(4)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    The carbon at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter. It is attached to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. (Correction: The structure should be cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, so C2 and C6 are sp3, C3 and C4 are sp2). The two pathways around the ring from C1 are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n**6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis). In a chair conformation, this corresponds to all three being axial or all three being equatorial.\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C3 axis of rotation (rotating by 120° gives an identical molecule). It also has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of any plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n*   **Step 1: Draw the structure.**\n    The name describes a ketone. The carbonyl group (`C=O`) is C1 of a butane chain. This C1 is also bonded to a cyclopentyl ring. There is a methyl group on C3 of the butane chain.\n    The structure is: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`\n*   **Step 2: Analyze for chirality.**\n    We need to check for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    - No carbon in the cyclopentyl ring is chiral (each has two hydrogens).\n    - The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized, so not chiral.\n    - The CH2 carbon is not chiral.\n    - The CH carbon at position 3 of the chain is bonded to: 1) -H, 2) a methyl group (-CH3), 3) another methyl group (-CH3, the end of the chain), and 4) the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group.\n    Since this carbon is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no chiral centers and no other source of chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Final Count:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.

A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image and lacks any elements of internal symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   A molecule is chiral if it has a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and lacks internal symmetry. This molecule has no stereocenters. The carbons of the double bond are bonded to only three groups. The other carbons are part of methyl or ethyl groups, which do not have four different substituents.\n    *   Furthermore, the plane containing the `C=C` double bond is a plane of symmetry for the molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex, bicyclic molecule. The IUPAC name provides the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (`3aR, 7aS`).\n    *   The designation of a specific stereoisomer (like `R` or `S`) indicates that the molecule is chiral and that we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   It is highly improbable for such a complex molecule with specified stereochemistry to be a meso compound (an achiral molecule with stereocenters).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereoisomer with the configuration `(2R,3S)` is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral despite having stereocenters because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion).\n    *   The symmetry element makes the molecule superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` stereoisomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, `(2R,3R)`, this compound is **chiral** and lacks internal symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom at position 1 (C1), which is attached to the -OH group, is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path around the ring.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral.\n    *   The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This molecule has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(s)` notation, similar to `cis`, indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   Due to this high degree of symmetry, the molecule possesses multiple symmetry elements, including a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**.\n    *   Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-CO-(cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a stereocenter. Let's check the carbons:\n        *   The isopropyl group `(CH3)2CH-` has a carbon bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it's not a stereocenter.\n        *   The `-CH2-` group has two identical hydrogen atoms.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon `C=O` is sp2-hybridized.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring is symmetrical.\n    *   There are no stereocenters in this molecule.

A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a single chiral center guarantees chirality, while molecules with multiple chiral centers can be achiral if they are meso compounds (containing an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This molecular planarity makes the compound superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex molecule includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E), which specify a particular stereoisomer. The 'R' and 'S' designations indicate the presence of chiral centers. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral and thus optically active.\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that makes them achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. Consequently, this molecule is not optically active.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R, 3R) configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being 2S, 3S). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at C1, which is a chiral center. The four groups attached to this carbon are different, and there is no internal plane of symmetry. As a specific enantiomer, this compound is chiral and optically active.\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This arrangement creates a plane of symmetry that passes through one of the C-OH bonds and the opposite carbon atom in the ring. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is an achiral meso compound and is not optically active.\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of the structure, which is (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)C₅H₉, reveals that there are no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to two identical methyl groups, making it achiral. The rest of the molecule also lacks any chiral elements. Therefore, the compound is achiral and not optically active.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nAn optically active compound is one that is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is most often due to the presence of one or more stereocenters and a lack of internal symmetry. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene***: This molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. Neither of the carbons in the double bond is a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry containing the atoms of the double bond, making it achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione***: The name itself indicates a specific stereoisomer with absolute configurations (3aR, 7aS) assigned to its chiral centers. The designation of a single enantiomer confirms that the molecule is chiral and thus **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the substituents on both chiral carbons are identical (a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, a carboxylic acid group, and the other chiral carbon). The (2R,3S) configuration results in a meso compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Meso compounds are achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: Like its diastereomer above, this molecule has two chiral centers. The (2R,3R) configuration is not meso and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer, and they are non-superimposable. Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  ***(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol***: The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. Carbon 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring due to the double bond's location. The specification of a single enantiomer means the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol***: The notation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule, despite having three stereocenters, possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv), which makes it achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one***: To determine if this compound is chiral, we must check for stereocenters. The structure is (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)-cyclopentyl. The only carbon atom that could potentially be a chiral center is carbon 3 of the butane chain, which is bonded to a hydrogen and two methyl groups. Since two of the groups attached to this carbon are identical (methyl groups), it is not a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, making it **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of stereocenters and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are key indicators of chirality.\n\n1.  ***(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene***: This compound is an alkene. The carbons of the double bond are not chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar and therefore has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione***: The name explicitly defines a specific stereoisomer with configurations (3aR, 7aS) at its chiral centers. Since a single, specific enantiomer is named, it is by definition chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such a compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters and are therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This compound also has two chiral centers. Unlike the (2R, 3S) version, the (2R, 3R) stereoisomer lacks a plane of symmetry and is part of an enantiomeric pair (the other being 2S, 3S). As a single enantiomer, it is chiral and optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol***: The name indicates the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. This specificity means it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, and thus it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol***: This compound, also known as cis-1,3,5-Cyclohexanetriol, has hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. Due to this high degree of symmetry, the molecule possesses planes of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one***: The structure of this ketone is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. An examination of the structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons), combined with an overall lack of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule has a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a plane. This planarity acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. The molecule does not have any chiral centers (sp3 carbon with four different substituents). Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides stereochemical information (`3aR,7aS,E`), indicating that we are considering a specific stereoisomer. The core structure, `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`, is a saturated norbornane-type skeleton fused with an anhydride ring. This parent skeleton is achiral (meso) due to a plane of symmetry. However, the substituent at position 8 (the methano bridge) is `=CHCl`. This `chloromethylene` group is not symmetric and its presence destroys the plane of symmetry of the parent skeleton. Since the molecule has designated chiral centers (`3aR, 7aS`) and lacks internal symmetry, it is a chiral molecule. As it's specified as a single stereoisomer, it will be optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3. The configuration is given as `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two chiral centers with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is often a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral because it possesses an internal element of symmetry (a plane or a center of inversion) that makes it superimposable on its mirror image. For `(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid`, there is a center of inversion halfway along the C2-C3 bond. Thus, it is a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. Both chiral centers have the `R` configuration. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. The `(2R,3R)` molecule is not superimposable on its `(2S,3S)` mirror image. It does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1. C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and =CH-CH2-CH2-. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies a single enantiomer (`R`). A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name refers to the stereoisomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all cis). This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not chiral centers because the path around the ring in one direction is identical to the path in the other direction.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon atom in the `CH` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no other sp3 carbons with four different groups in the molecule. The molecule is flexible, but it is fundamentally achiral and has conformations with a plane of symmetry. Thus, it is optically inactive.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically Active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n*   Optically Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons). However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond, leading to geometric isomerism (Z/E), but it does not have any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex molecule, but we are given its absolute stereochemistry via the descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E).\n    *   The presence of R/S descriptors indicates that the molecule has chiral centers (at positions 3a and 7a). The 'E' descriptor specifies the geometry of a double bond.\n    *   A specific stereoisomer of a molecule with chiral centers is optically active unless it is a meso compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The parent structure, hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, might be a meso compound (like the endo-Diels-Alder adduct of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride). However, the `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent (`=CH-Cl`), presumably on the methano bridge (C7 in norbornane numbering), breaks the potential plane of symmetry of the core structure.\n    *   Because the substituent destroys the internal symmetry, the molecule becomes chiral. The name specifies a single, resolved stereoisomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereoisomer with the (2R, 3S) configuration has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   A molecule with chiral centers but also an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R, 3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable (an enantiomeric pair).\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (one path around the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other path).\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This molecule has three OH groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The designation (1s,3s,5s) implies that all three groups have the same relative stereochemistry (all cis or all trans).\n    *   In the all-cis configuration (all OH groups pointing to the same side of the ring, e.g., all axial or all equatorial), the molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses several planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group).\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. It's worth noting that the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true chiral centers in this symmetric molecule (they are prochiral).\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Following IUPAC nomenclature, the parent chain is butan-1-one, with a cyclopentyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 3.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`. This can also be seen as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups, and the rest of the chain. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nAn analysis of each compound for optical activity is required. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and is not present as a racemic mixture. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is typically due to the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `CH₃CH₂(CH₃)C=CHCl`. This is an alkene, and all the atoms connected to the double bond lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` in the name specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The complex bicyclic structure with defined chiral centers (`3aR`, `7aS`) lacks any internal symmetry. A single enantiomer of a chiral molecule is by definition optically active. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3. However, the molecule is symmetrical in its connectivity. With opposite stereochemical configurations (`R` and `S`), an internal plane of symmetry exists between the two chiral carbons. This makes it a *meso* compound, which is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the above compound. Both chiral centers have the same configuration (`R`). This isomer lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is attached to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH₂-CH=` part of the ring, and (4) the `=CH-CH₂-CH₂-` part of the ring. This makes C1 a chiral center. The molecule is chiral, and the name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This isomer has all three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the ring (`all-cis`). This configuration results in a highly symmetrical molecule that possesses multiple planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`. This molecule does not have any chiral centers. The carbon in the isopropyl group `CH(CH₃)₂` is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group and its adjacent chain, making it achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in total.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral and must be present in a form that is not a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be achiral are the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes absolute configuration descriptors ((3aR,7aS)). This indicates that a specific stereoisomer is being described. For such a complex molecule, unless it is a meso compound (which is highly unlikely given the lack of symmetry in the name and structure), specifying a single stereoisomer means we have a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). We need to determine if the (2R,3S) stereoisomer is chiral or a meso compound.\n    Let's draw a conformation of the molecule. In the anti-periplanar conformation (staggered, with COOH groups opposite), there is a center of inversion halfway along the C2-C3 bond. The C2(R) configuration is opposite to the C3(S) configuration, the methyl on C2 is opposite to the methyl on C3, and the H on C2 is opposite to the H on C3. The presence of a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral. This is a **meso compound**, and it is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. They do not have any internal symmetry elements (like a plane or center of symmetry). The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R). Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and an alcohol group. The carbon atom bonded to the -OH group (C1) is a chiral center. Its four different substituents are -H, -OH, the ring path towards the double bond (`-CH2-CH=`), and the ring path away from the double bond (`-CH2-CH2-`). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has -OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 of a cyclohexane ring. There are two possible stereoisomers: one where all -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis), and one where two are on one side and one is on the other (cis-trans).\n    *   The all-cis isomer possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bonds. It is **achiral**.\n    *   The cis-trans isomer (e.g., OHs at C1 and C3 are up, OH at C5 is down) possesses a single plane of symmetry that passes through the C5-OH bond and the C2-H bonds. This is a **meso compound** and is **achiral**.\n    Since all possible stereoisomers are achiral, this compound is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The IUPAC name specifies a ketone where a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutanoyl group are attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`.\n    Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential chiral center is C3 of the butane chain. The four groups attached to C3 are:\n    1.  -H\n    2.  -CH3 (the terminal methyl group of the butane chain, C4)\n    3.  -CH3 (the substituent methyl group)\n    4.  -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl\n    Since two of the groups attached to C3 are identical methyl groups, C3 is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive. (Note: Even if the intended molecule was chiral, e.g., 1-cyclopentyl-2-methylbutan-1-one, the name does not specify a single enantiomer, so it would be a racemic mixture, which is also optically inactive.)\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive (achiral)\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active** (chiral, single enantiomer specified)\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso/achiral)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active** (chiral, single enantiomer specified)\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active** (chiral, single enantiomer specified)\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we need to assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. The compounds listed are specific stereoisomers, so we are evaluating each one individually. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image and typically lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  ** (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule itself is planar with respect to the atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them. This planarity acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ** (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself indicates a specific stereoisomer with defined absolute configurations (3aR, 7aS) at its chiral centers. A compound that is a single enantiomer of a chiral substance is by definition optically active. The complex bicyclic structure does not possess symmetry elements that would render it achiral.\n\n3.  ** (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, due to the (2R,3S) configuration, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3. Molecules with chiral centers that are overall achiral due to such symmetry are called meso compounds. Meso compounds are optically inactive.\n\n4.  ** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso-compound mentioned above. It has two chiral centers and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound.\n\n5.  ** (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon-1, which is a chiral center. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group is attached to four different groups, making it a stereocenter. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ** (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This notation typically refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule has multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group) and a C3 axis of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  ** 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** This ketone does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the isobutyl group and the cyclopentyl ring are not bonded to four different substituents. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is most often due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** The structure is Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. The molecule contains a double bond, and the atoms around it lie in a plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. The parent ring system is based on a norbornane-like structure, which is chiral. By naming a specific enantiomer, it confirms the compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the substituents on both carbons are identical (H, CH₃, COOH). The (2R,3S) configuration creates a plane of symmetry between the two chiral carbons. This type of compound is known as a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers and is therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso-compound above. In the (2R,3R) configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. Because it is chiral, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, indicating the compound is chiral. The carbon atom C1, which is bonded to the hydroxyl group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups (H, OH, -CH₂-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH₂-), making the molecule chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The nomenclature indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This highly symmetrical arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite C4 atom bisects the molecule into two identical halves. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. An examination of the molecule reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atom C3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, and no carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are asymmetrically substituted. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.

As an enantiomer (the other being 2S, 3S), it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol***: The (R) designation indicates a specific configuration at the chiral carbon C1, which is bonded to four different groups. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral and optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol***: In this compound, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry in the molecule. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and its attached carbon, bisecting the ring. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one***: To determine chirality, we look for chiral centers and planes of symmetry. The molecule does not contain any chiral carbons. A plane of symmetry can be envisioned passing through the carbonyl group and bisecting the cyclopentyl ring, making the molecule achiral and optically inactive.\n\nTallying the results, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 compounds from the list will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nTo determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Typically, this means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$) or a center of inversion ($i$).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:**\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n      Cl   CH2-CH3\n       \\ /\n        C=C\n       / \\\n      H   CH3\n    ```\n    This molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Any planar molecule is achiral.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:**\n    The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the molecule has stereocenters and a specific configuration is being described. A compound that can exist as a single, stable enantiomer is chiral. The name specifies one such enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). The substituents on both stereocenters are identical (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`, and the other `-CH(CH3)COOH` group). When a molecule has two stereocenters with identical substituents, the isomer with opposite configurations (R,S or S,R) is a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and are achiral, despite having stereocenters.\n    The (2R,3S) isomer is the meso form.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It is one of a pair of enantiomers, with its mirror image being the (2S,3S) isomer. Since it is a chiral molecule and is non-superimposable on its mirror image, it is optically active.\n    Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:**\n    The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at a stereocenter (C1). C1 is bonded to four different groups: `-H`, `-OH`, `-CH=CH-` (part of the ring), and `-CH2-CH2-` (part of the ring). A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name refers to a single enantiomer.\n    Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:**\n    This name describes the isomer where the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the ring (the all-`cis` isomer). Let's visualize this molecule in a chair conformation with all OH groups pointing \"up\". They would be in axial, axial, axial positions or equatorial, equatorial, equatorial positions. In either conformation, the molecule possesses high symmetry, including a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry that each pass through a C-OH bond. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:**\n    The structure can be deduced from the name: a cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon of a 3-methylbutanone chain. The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Let's check for stereocenters. The carbon `CH` is bonded to two identical methyl (`CH3`) groups, a hydrogen (`H`), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. The molecule has no other stereocenters and possesses a plane of symmetry in a symmetric conformation. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n-   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** Not optically active\n-   **(3aR,7aS,E)-...:** **Optically active**\n-   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** Not optically active (meso)\n-   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** **Optically active**\n-   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** **Optically active**\n-   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** Not optically active\n-   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** Not optically active\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity, we have 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if its molecules are chiral. Chirality is the property of a molecule being non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. This molecule is planar and therefore possesses a plane of symmetry, making it **achiral** and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The specific stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS) indicate a single, specific enantiomer of a complex, bridged molecule. A specific enantiomer is by definition chiral. This compound is **chiral** and therefore optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule, with the chemical formula `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`, has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry between the two centers. This makes it a **meso compound**, which is **achiral** and not optically active.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being 2S, 3S) and is **chiral** and optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name explicitly denotes a specific enantiomer, (R). Carbon 1 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, the alkenyl part of the ring, and the alkyl part of the ring). As a single enantiomer, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This nomenclature denotes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through a C-OH group) and is therefore **achiral**.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. An examination of the structure reveals no chiral centers. Carbon 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry and is **achiral**.\n\nCounting the compounds that are chiral and thus optically active:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nTo determine which of the given compounds are optically active, we need to assess the chirality of each molecule. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The presence of stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or a specific named enantiomer is a strong indicator of optical activity, unless the compound is meso.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze each compound for chirality:**\n    *   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a double bond. There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents). The molecule is planar and thus superimposable on its mirror image (achiral). It is optically **inactive**.\n    *   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself specifies a single, complex stereoisomer with (R) and (S) configurations. Such a molecule is a single enantiomer, which is by definition chiral and optically **active**. The structure is too complex and asymmetric to be a meso compound.\n    *   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric (HOOC- and -COOH at the ends). The (R,S) configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers. It is optically **inactive**.\n    *   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. Both chiral centers have the same (R) configuration. It lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Therefore, it is chiral and optically **active**.\n    *   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at C1. The carbon atom C1 is bonded to -OH, -H, -CH2-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH2- groups, which are four different groups. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound is chiral and optically **active**.\n    *   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This molecule possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and bisecting the opposite C-C bond. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. It is optically **inactive**.\n    *   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** Let's look for a chiral center. The structure is (cyclopentyl)-CO-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it's not a chiral center. No other carbon is chiral. The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **Count the optically active compounds:**\n    Based on the analysis, three compounds are optically active:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 3.\n\n```python\ndef solve_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": {\n            \"active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"This molecule is planar and has no chiral centers, making it achiral.\"\n        },\n        \"(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\": {\n            \"active\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"The name specifies a single enantiomer with R and S configurations.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups). A compound with chiral centers can still be achiral if it is a meso compound, which possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound.\n\n**1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n       Cl   CH3\n        \\  /\n         C==C\n        /  \\\n       H   CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule is an alkene. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbons of the double bond (C1 and C2) cannot be chiral centers. C3 (in the ethyl group) is a CH2, and C4 is a CH3, neither are chiral. The methyl group attached to C2 is also not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the double bond).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\n**2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n*   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS). These R/S descriptors are used to specify the absolute configuration of specific stereocenters in a single enantiomer. A compound that is designated as a specific enantiomer (like (R)- or (S)-) is by definition chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the name specifies a single, non-racemic enantiomer, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n**3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n*   **Analysis:** The name specifies the stereochemistry as (2R, 3S). Let's examine the symmetry of this stereoisomer. In this molecule, the two halves (from the center of the C2-C3 bond) are mirror images of each other. The molecule has an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    ```\n         COOH\n          |\n    H----|----CH3  (S)\n          |\n   CH3---|----H    (R)  <-- My assignment here might be off, but the relative R,S config makes it meso\n          |\n         COOH\n    ```\n    With (2R, 3S) or (2S, 3R) configurations, the molecule is a meso compound.

(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** Same molecular formula as above, but with a different stereochemistry.\n*   **Analysis:** The stereochemistry is specified as (2R, 3R). This stereoisomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, and the two are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion:** As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, (2R, 3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **optically active**.\n\n**5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n*   **Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a -CH2-CH= group (path towards C2), and a -CH2-CH2-CH= group (path towards C6). Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the (R) configuration, indicating we are considering a single enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, so it is **optically active**.\n\n**6.

It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3 axis) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n*   **Structure:** cyclopentyl-CO-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂\n*   **Analysis:** We need to check for any chiral centers.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH₂-CO-cyclopentyl group, and two identical methyl groups (-CH₃).

The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, in which case it is called a meso compound. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This molecule is an alkene. There are no stereocenters (sp³ carbon atoms bonded to four different groups). The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the carbon-carbon double bond and all atoms directly attached to it. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`, indicating that this is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer is by definition optically active, unless it happens to be a meso compound (an achiral molecule with stereocenters).\n    *   The complex bicyclic structure with the asymmetric `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent (`=CHCl`) lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Since it is a specific, asymmetric stereoisomer, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   This is a classic example of a meso compound. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry when the molecule is in the proper conformation (e.g., an eclipsed conformation, which is easily seen with a Fischer projection).\n    *   Because it is a meso compound, it is achiral despite having stereocenters. Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above.

The four different groups attached to it are -H, -OH, the path `-CH₂-CH=` (towards C2), and the path `-CH₂-CH₂-CH=` (towards C6). The presence of the double bond makes the two paths around the ring non-equivalent.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the isomer where the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.

The optical activity for each compound is determined as follows:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule lacks a chiral center and possesses a plane of symmetry within the plane of the double bond. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (3aR, 7aS).

However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers, and this specific stereoisomer (2R,3R) does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is one of a pair of enantiomers and is therefore optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the R configuration at the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1), which is a chiral center. As a specific enantiomer, this compound is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this compound, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry.

(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar with respect to the atoms of the double bond and their immediate attachments. This planarity creates a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself specifies a single, specific stereoisomer using the (R), (S), and (E) designations. The presence of these descriptors indicates the existence of chiral centers and a defined stereochemistry. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3. Such compounds are called meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry and is a chiral molecule. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is **optically active**. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center. It is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, the -CH=CH- part of the ring, and the -CH2-CH2- part of the ring. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and thus **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl-bearing carbon and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule symmetrically. Due to this symmetry, the compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this molecule is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. An analysis of the structure reveals that there are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. Therefore, the molecule has no chiral center and is **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and often contain one or more chiral centers. A specific enantiomer designated with (R) or (S) notation is, by definition, optically active. However, molecules with multiple chiral centers can be achiral if they have an internal plane of symmetry; such compounds are called meso compounds.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a double bond and the atoms involved in it lie in a plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n*   ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (R and S), indicating that it is a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is optically **active**.\n*   ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and thus optically **inactive**.\n*   ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. It possesses two chiral centers and lacks a plane of symmetry, making it a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound, and they are not superimposable. As a single enantiomer, it is optically **active**.\n*   ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation (R) specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups. Therefore, this compound is optically **active**.\n*   ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The 'cis' or 's' notation indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This symmetrical arrangement means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. As an achiral compound, it is optically **inactive**.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The most plausible structure for this name is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. An analysis of this structure reveals no chiral centers and a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.

A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a single enantiomer (indicated by R/S descriptors) or the absence of any symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) indicates chirality and thus optical activity.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule contains a double bond, giving rise to (E/Z) isomerism, but it lacks any chiral centers (an sp3 carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule also does not possess axial or planar chirality. The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule if we consider the conformations of the ethyl group. More rigorously, any conformation will have a superimposable mirror image.\n    *   Thus, it is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The key information is in the stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`.\n    *   The `(3aR,7aS)` part specifies the absolute configuration at two bridgehead stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a. The presence of specific R/S descriptors for a single molecule indicates that we are dealing with a single enantiomer, not a racemic mixture.\n    *   For a molecule with multiple stereocenters to be achiral (a meso compound), the stereocenters must be related by an internal symmetry element, which would typically require them to have opposite configurations (e.g., R and S) and be structurally equivalent. Here, C-3a and C-7a are not structurally equivalent in the isobenzofuran ring system.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   The specific isomer is `(2R,3S)`. When the two stereocenters have opposite configurations (R,S) in a molecule with this type of symmetry, we must check for a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Drawing the molecule, for example, in a Fischer projection or a staggered conformation, reveals a plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3.\n    *   A molecule with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The stereocenters have the `(2R,3R)` configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. This pair constitutes a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the name specifies a single enantiomer `(2R,3R)`, it is a chiral substance and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the ring path `-C2H2-C3H=`, and the other ring path `-C6H2-C5H2-`. Because the paths around the ring are different due to the location of the double bond, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule containing only one stereocenter is always chiral.\n    *   The `(R)` designation indicates a specific enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups in a 1,3,5-relationship. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` typically refers to the highly symmetric, all-`cis` isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   In its stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups would be in equatorial positions.\n    *   This molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group opposite to it.\n    *   Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. It's a meso-like compound where the potential stereocenters (C1, C3, C5) are actually prochiral because the two ring pathways from each carbon are identical.\n    *   Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a butan-1-one parent structure. This is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. `C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)-`.\n    *   Substituents are a cyclopentyl group at C1 and a methyl group at C3.\n    *   Assembling the structure gives: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check this molecule for chiral centers. C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a C4-methyl group, a C3-substituent methyl group, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. The two methyl groups attached to C3 make it not a chiral center.\n    *   Let's re-examine the structure. The molecule is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the cyclopentyl ring and contains the C=O group, the C2(H2) group, and the C3(H) atom of the chain.\n    *   Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound.

Given the complexity and lack of symmetry in the core structure, and the specification of a single configuration, this molecule is chiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral and optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, with the `(2R,3S)` configuration, there is an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. The top half of the molecule is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   This is a classic example of a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral and optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral and optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) `-CH=CH-CH2-` (path one way around the ring), and 4) `-CH2-CH2-` (path the other way). This makes C1 a chiral center.\n    *   Since the molecule has a single chiral center and the name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, it is a pure chiral substance.\n    *   Conclusion: **Chiral and optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and bisecting the opposite C-C bond.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral and optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring)`\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers. The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH-` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it's not chiral. The `-CH2-` and carbonyl (`C=O`) carbons are not chiral. The cyclopentyl ring has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and passes through the center of the ring.\n    *   The entire molecule lacks any chiral centers and is symmetrical.\n    *   Conclusion: **Achiral and optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nA molecule will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally occurs in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Here's an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule lacks a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The nomenclature (3aR, 7aS) indicates the presence of specific stereocenters. Naming a compound with R/S designations signifies that it is a single, chiral enantiomer, which by definition is optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry due to the (R,S) configuration and the identical substituents on both ends (carboxylic acid groups). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The (2R,3R) configuration means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image (the 2S,3S enantiomer). As a specific enantiomer, it is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH=CH-, and -CH2-CH2-), making it a chiral center. The (R) designation specifies that it is a single enantiomer, which is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound, also known as *cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has multiple planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one hydroxylated carbon and the CH2 group opposite to it. The presence of these symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of this molecule's structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. The carbon in the butyl chain at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nTo determine which of the following compounds will exhibit optical activity, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, and it is not a meso compound.\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This alkene does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with defined chiral centers ((3aR,7aS)). The designation of a specific enantiomer indicates the compound is chiral and, therefore, optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry within the molecule. This internal symmetry makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This stereoisomer also has two chiral centers. Unlike its (2R,3S) counterpart, it lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, indicating the presence of a chiral center at the carbon bearing the -OH group. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is more commonly known as *cis,cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol. Although it has stereocenters, the symmetrical arrangement of the three hydroxyl groups on one side of the ring creates planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this ketone's structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, meaning it lacks a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione is **active**.\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **active**.\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is **active**.\n\nIn total, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule contains one or more chiral centers and lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere's an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule itself is planar, which means it has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name specifies a single, complex stereoisomer with designated chiral centers (3aR, 7aS). Such a specific designation indicates that it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. Due to its complex, bridged structure, it lacks internal symmetry and is therefore **optically active**.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and, despite having chiral centers, are optically inactive.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. It has two chiral centers and lacks an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image, the (2S, 3S) isomer, is non-superimposable. Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The '(R)' in the name designates a specific enantiomer. The carbon atom attached to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. The molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image and is thus **optically active**.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This molecule has three stereocenters. However, the 'cis' arrangement (all hydroxyl groups on the same side of the ring) gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, and no carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
