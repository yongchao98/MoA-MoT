These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them based on the provided definitions.\n\n### 1. Definitions and Setup\n\n*   **q**: The point charge.\n*   **$\\vec{s}(t)$**: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n*   **$\\vec{r}$**: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   **t**: The time of observation.\n*   **$t_r$**: The retarded time, which is the time the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach the observer at time t. The signal travels at the speed of light, c.\n*   **$\\vec{d}$**: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time, $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n*   The relationship between t and $t_r$ is given by the time it takes for light to travel the distance d:\n    *   $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n*   **$\\vec{v}$**: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}\\bigg|_{t'=t_r}$\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general formulas for the retarded potentials are given by integrals over the source distributions (charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$):\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\nFor a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Scalar Potential V\n\nSubstituting the charge density into the formula for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThis integral is tricky because the retarded time $t_r'$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard method to evaluate this is to introduce another delta function for time and integrate over both space and time.\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c)) d^3r' dt'$\n\nFirst, we integrate over the spatial coordinates $d^3r'$. The Dirac delta function $\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$ collapses the integral:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|/c)) dt'$\n\nNow we have an integral over time $t'$. We use the property of the Dirac delta function: $\\int f(x) \\delta(g(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$, where $g(x_i)=0$.\nHere, $f(t') = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}$ and $g(t') = t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c}$.\nThe root of $g(t')=0$ is the retarded time $t_r$.\nWe need to compute the derivative $g'(t')$:\n$g'(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'} \\left( t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\nThe derivative of the magnitude is:\n$\\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| = \\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (-\\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'})}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} = -\\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} = -\\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')$\nwhere $\\hat{d}(t')$ is the unit vector from the charge to the observer.\n\nSo, $g'(t') = 1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{c}$.\nEvaluating at the retarded time $t_r$, and using the notation from the problem statement:\n$g'(t_r) = 1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{f(t_r)}{|g'(t_r)|} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1/|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{|(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/dc|} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1/d}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/dc}$\n(Assuming $dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$, which is true for charges moving at speeds less than c).\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{c}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 4. Derivation of the Vector Potential A\n\nThe derivation for $\\vec{A}$ is analogous. The integrand just has an extra factor of $\\vec{v}(t')$.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{v}(t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|/c)) dt'$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r)/|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{|g'(t_r)|} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}/d}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/dc}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{c\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nThe derived potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect. This is the static potential and an incorrect relation for A.\nB) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - This matches our derived expressions perfectly.\nC) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Incorrect sign in the denominator.\nD) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect expression for V. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the formula for V is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct one.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the finite speed of light, meaning the field observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* was generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*.\n\nThe scalar potential is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\nBy multiplying the numerator and denominator by *c*, this can be rewritten as:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential is related to the scalar potential by the velocity of the charge at the retarded time:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n\nSubstituting the expression for V gives:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nUsing the relationship $c^2 = \\dfrac{1}{\\mu_o\\epsilon_o}$, we can express the vector potential in terms of the permeability of free space, $\\mu_o$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nComparing these derived expressions with the given options, option D correctly identifies both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the fields observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$. This is the time at which a signal, traveling at the speed of light $c$, would have to be emitted from the charge's position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Retarded Time:** The time delay is the light travel time: $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\n2.  **Notation:** Let's use the notation from the problem description:\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the field point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** To match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator:\n    *   $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n    *   Substituting this back into the potential equations:\n        *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n        *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   Option A: Incorrect.

The expressions for both V and $\\vec{A}$ match our derived formulas.\n    *   Option D: Incorrect. It uses the static potential for V. Although the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct, the expression for V itself is wrong for a moving charge.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n# These are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n# The standard formulas are:\n# V(r, t) = (1 / (4*pi*epsilon_0)) * [q / (d - (d_vec . v_vec) / c)]\n# A(r, t) = (mu_0 / (4*pi)) * [q * v_vec / (d - (d_vec . v_vec) / c)]\n\n# where:\n# d_vec is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time (tr) to the observation point (r).\n# d is the magnitude of d_vec.\n# v_vec is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n# c is the speed of light.\n\n# We can rewrite the denominator:\n# d - (d_vec . v_vec) / c = (1/c) * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec)\n\n# Substituting this back into the potential equations:\n# V(r, t) = (1 / (4*pi*epsilon_0)) * [q / ((1/c) * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))]\n# V(r, t) = (q*c) / (4*pi*epsilon_0 * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\n\n# A(r, t) = (mu_0 / (4*pi)) * [q * v_vec / ((1/c) * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))]\n# A(r, t) = (mu_0 * q * c * v_vec) / (4*pi * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\n\n# Now we compare these results with the given options.\n# Option A uses static potentials, which is incorrect.\n# Option B has a '+' sign in the denominator, which is incorrect.\n# Option C matches our derived expressions for both V and A.\n# Option D uses the static potential for V, which is incorrect.\n\n# Therefore, the correct choice is C.\n\ncorrect_choice = 'C'\nprint(f\"The correct expressions for the scalar potential V and vector potential A are given in option C.\")\nprint(f\"V(r,t) = qc / (4*pi*epsilon_o * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\")\nprint(f\"A(r,t) = (mu_o * q * c * v_vec) / (4*pi * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to choice: {correct_choice}\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The correct expressions for the scalar potential V and vector potential A are given in option C.\nV(r,t) = qc / (4*pi*epsilon_o * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\nA(r,t) = (mu_o * q * c * v_vec) / (4*pi * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\nThis corresponds to choice: C\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Scenario:** We are dealing with a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, the scalar potential `V` and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$, at a specific point in space $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n\n2.  **Concept of Retarded Potentials:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$. The information (the field) had to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\n3.  **Define Key Quantities:**\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The field point (observation point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time $t_r$. This is the source point.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\n4.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the signal to travel the distance `d` is $d/c$. This leads to the fundamental equation for the retarded time:\n    $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n    This is an implicit equation for $t_r$, as $t_r$ appears on both sides.\n\n5.  **General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:** The general solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials in the Lorenz gauge are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $\\rho$ is the charge density and $\\vec{J}$ is the current density, and $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n6.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` at position $\\vec{s}(t)$, the densities are:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Integrals (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):** Substituting these densities into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals is a non-trivial task because the retarded time $t_r'$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard result of this evaluation gives the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n    The key result of the integration is that the effective charge seen by the observer is modified by a Doppler-like factor. The denominator of the static potential, $4\\pi\\epsilon_0 d$, gets modified.\n\n    The resulting potentials are:\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n        where $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observer. The subscript $t_r$ means all quantities inside the bracket (d, $\\hat{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n8.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** Let's rewrite the denominator to match the options provided:\n    $d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the potential expressions:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Retardation is Key:** The potentials are not determined by the charge's current position and velocity, but by its position and velocity at the retarded time $t_r$. Options A and C use the static form for V, which is incorrect.\n*   **The Denominator Factor:** The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is crucial. It is not simply `dc`. This term accounts for the relativistic effect of the charge's motion on the potential. If the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential becomes larger. This is analogous to the Doppler effect for sound or light waves.\n*   **Sign Convention:** The sign in the denominator is negative: $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. A positive sign, as in option D, is incorrect and would describe an unphysical situation.\n*   **Relationship between V and A:** Notice that $\\vec{A} = (\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v}) V$. Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, this simplifies to $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This is a fundamental relationship for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived expressions with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect V and A.\n*   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   C) Incorrect V.\n*   D) Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The derivation of these potentials is a standard topic in electromagnetism.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\nThe electric and magnetic fields at an observation point `r` at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge `q` at an earlier time, called the retarded time `tr`. This is because electromagnetic disturbances propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined implicitly by the relation:\n`t = tr + d/c`\nwhere `d` is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time, `s(tr)`, to the observation point `r`.\n`d = |r - s(tr)|`\n\nThe potentials `V(r, t)` and `A(r, t)` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t_ret) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_ret) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\nwhere `t_ret = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)` and velocity `v(t) = ds/dt`, the charge and current densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Scalar Potential (V)\nSubstituting the charge density into the formula for `V`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q δ³(r' - s(t - |r - r'|/c)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThis integral is non-trivial because the retarded time depends on the integration variable `r'`. A standard method to solve this is to change the integration variable or, more formally, to evaluate the integral by first integrating over space and then time.\n\nLet's consider the integral in a slightly different form:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫∫ [ρ(r', t') / |r - r'|] δ(t' - (t - |r - r'|/c)) dt' d³r'`\nSubstitute `ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`:\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) ∫∫ [δ³(r' - s(t')) / |r - r'|] δ(t' - (t - |r - r'|/c)) dt' d³r'`\n\nFirst, perform the spatial integral over `d³r'`:\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) ∫ [1 / |r - s(t')|] δ(t' - (t - |r - s(t')|/c)) dt'`\n\nThis integral is of the form `∫ f(t') δ(g(t')) dt'`. The result is `f(tr) / |g'(tr)|`, where `tr` is the time at which `g(tr) = 0`.\nHere, `f(t') = 1 / |r - s(t')|` and `g(t') = t' - t + |r - s(t')|/c`.\nThe condition `g(tr) = 0` gives `tr - t + |r - s(tr)|/c = 0`, which is the definition of the retarded time `tr`.\n\nNow we need to compute the derivative `g'(t')`:\n`g'(t') = d/dt' [t' - t + (1/c) |r - s(t')|] = 1 + (1/c) * d/dt'|r - s(t')|`\nLet `d(t') = r - s(t')`. The magnitude is `d(t') = |d(t')|`.\n`d/dt' d(t') = d/dt' sqrt(d(t') ⋅ d(t')) = (1 / (2d(t'))) * 2d(t') ⋅ (d/dt' d(t'))`\n`d/dt' d(t') = d/dt' (r - s(t')) = -s'(t') = -v(t')`\nSo, `d/dt' d(t') = (d(t') ⋅ (-v(t'))) / d(t') = - (d(t') ⋅ v(t')) / d(t')`\n\nEvaluating at `t' = tr`, and using the notation from the problem statement (`d = r - s(tr)`, `d = |d|`, `v = v(tr)`):\n`g'(tr) = 1 + (1/c) * [ - (d ⋅ v) / d ] = 1 - (d ⋅ v) / (cd) = (cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)`\n\nThe term `cd - d ⋅ v` is always positive for a charge moving at less than the speed of light (`v < c`), so we can drop the absolute value.\n`|g'(tr)| = (cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)`\n\nNow, we can find the potential:\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * f(tr) / g'(tr)`\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * [1 / |r - s(tr)|] / [(cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)]`\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * (1/d) * [cd / (cd - d ⋅ v)]`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Vector Potential (A)\nThe derivation for `A` is analogous.\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_ret) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) ∫ [v(t') / |r - s(t')|] δ(t' - (t - |r - s(t')|/c)) dt'`\n\nThe integral is evaluated in the same way. The function `f(t')` is now `v(t') / |r - s(t')|`.\n`f(tr) = v(tr) / |r - s(tr)| = v / d`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) * f(tr) / g'(tr)`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) * (v/d) / [(cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) * (v/d) * [cd / (cd - d ⋅ v)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ qcv) / (4π (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n*   `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qcv) / (4π (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\nThese expressions match option D exactly.\n\n*   **Option A** has a `+` sign in the denominator, which corresponds to advanced potentials (physically non-causal).\n*   **Options B and C** use the simple static potential form `q / (4πε₀ r)`, which is incorrect as it ignores the retardation effect on the distance and the motion of the charge. The distance should be `d = |r - s(tr)|`, not `r = |r|`, and the denominator needs the corrective factor `(1 - n̂ ⋅ v/c)`.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

The standard denominator is often written as $[R - \\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c]$, where R is the distance from the retarded position.

These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` depends on the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\nAll the quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.

A key relationship between the Liénard-Wiechert potentials is $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's verify this with the expression for V we just found and the known relationship $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n\n$\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c^2 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nUsing $\\mu_o = 1/(\\epsilon_o c^2)$, which means $\\mu_o c = 1/(\\epsilon_o c)$, we can substitute this into the expression:\n$\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o c q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThis expression for the vector potential matches the one provided in option C.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    The general solutions for the scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ in electrodynamics, under the Lorenz gauge condition, are given by the retarded potential formulas. These formulas account for the finite speed of light, `c`, meaning the fields at a point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ depend on the state of the sources at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n    Here, $\\rho$ is the charge density, $\\vec{J}$ is the current density, $\\vec{r}'$ is the position vector of a point within the source distribution, and $t_r$ is the retarded time, defined by the relation:\n    $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n    This equation signifies that the signal (field) emitted from $\\vec{r}'$ at time $t_r$ travels a distance $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|$ and arrives at the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the present time $t$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n    The key difficulty in evaluating these integrals is that the retarded time $t_r$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often shown in advanced E&M textbooks) involves a change of variables and accounts for the \"compression\" of the apparent volume of the source due to its motion.\n\n    The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator. Let's define the quantities as given in the problem:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$: Velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\n    The retarded time condition becomes $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n    The result of the integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} = \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n    The term $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})$ accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. If the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator decreases, leading to a stronger potential, and vice-versa.\n\n4.  **Final Expressions for V and A**\n    Substituting this result back into the integral expressions for V and A:\n\n    For the scalar potential V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right)$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    For the vector potential A:\n    The velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is constant with respect to the spatial integration over $\\vec{r}'$, so it can be taken out of the integral.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right)$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options**\n    Let's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect. V is the static potential, which doesn't account for retardation. The expression for A is dimensionally wrong.\n\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This has the wrong sign in the denominator, which is physically incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        Again, V is the incorrect static potential. Although the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since $\\vec{A}/V = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} = \\vec{v}/c^2$), the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge.

Consequently, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the **retarded time**. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer.\n\n2.  **Defining the Variables (as per the problem statement):**\n    *   $q$: The charge.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The retarded time condition is: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potential Formulas:** The derivation from the general retarded potential integrals is a standard textbook exercise. The resulting potentials are:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{\\text{retarded}}$\n\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{\\text{retarded}}$\n\n    The subscript \"retarded\" emphasizes that all quantities in the brackets ($d$, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The term in the denominator, $(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)$, accounts for the relativistic compression of the field due to the charge's motion.\n\n4.  **Matching the Formula to the Options:** The given options have a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the standard expressions by $c$:\n\n    *   **For the Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   **For the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparison with the Given Options:**\n    *   Options A and B are incorrect. They represent non-relativistic or quasi-static approximations and fail to include the crucial denominator term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ that accounts for retardation effects.\n    *   Option D is incorrect because it has a plus sign ($+$) in the denominator. The correct sign is minus ($-$), which is a direct consequence of the physics of retardation. A plus sign would correspond to an unphysical \"advanced potential\" that violates causality.\n    *   Option C exactly matches the expressions we derived:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the fundamental principles of electromagnetism.\n\n### 1. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ due to a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must be emitted from the source point $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n### 2. Charge and Current Density of a Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge at time $t'$.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Scalar Potential (V)\n\nSubstitute the charge density into the formula for V:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe delta function is non-zero only when $\\vec{r}' = \\vec{s}(t_r)$. However, the retarded time $t_r$ itself depends on $\\vec{r}'$: $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$. This makes the integral non-trivial.\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the property of the Dirac delta function with a functional argument: $\\int f(x) \\delta(g(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$, where $x_i$ are the roots of $g(x)=0$. In 3D, this becomes:\n\n$\\int f(\\vec{r}') \\delta^3(\\vec{g}(\\vec{r}')) d^3r' = \\frac{f(\\vec{r}'_0)}{|\\det(\\nabla \\vec{g})|}$, where $\\vec{g}(\\vec{r}'_0) = 0$.\n\nIn our case, $\\vec{g}(\\vec{r}') = \\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r) = \\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c)$. The integral picks out the value at the unique source position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ where the argument of the delta function is zero. Let's use the notation from the problem statement:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the source to the observer.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nThe retarded time condition is $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\nThe effect of the moving source is to change the effective volume element. The Jacobian of the transformation from $\\vec{r}'$ to $\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is needed. A standard derivation (e.g., in Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\", Section 10.3.2) shows that this introduces a correction factor in the denominator:\n\n$\\int \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r)) d^3r' = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\nApplying this to the integral for V:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)\n\nThe calculation for the vector potential is analogous. We substitute the current density into the formula for $\\vec{A}$:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is evaluated at the retarded time, so it is treated as a constant during the spatial integration over $\\vec{r}'$. The integral is the same as before, but with an extra factor of $q\\vec{v}(t_r)$ in the numerator instead of just $q$.\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nThe derived expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions exactly match option A.\n\nLet's briefly check the other options:\n*   B) and D) use the static potential form $V = q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_o r)$, which is incorrect as it neglects the retardation effect in the denominator and uses the instantaneous distance $r$ instead of the retarded distance $d$.\n*   C) has an incorrect sign ($+$ instead of $-$) in the denominator. The minus sign is crucial; it shows that the potential is enhanced when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\nTherefore, option A correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time `t` depend on the state of the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is implicitly defined by the relation $t = t_r + d/c$, where `d` is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$ from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nThe correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by:\n\nScalar Potential:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nVector Potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (the charge's position, velocity, and the distance vector) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\nBy factoring out `c` from the denominator, the expressions can be rewritten as:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThese expressions match option B. It is important to note that for a moving charge, a scalar potential alone is not sufficient to describe the electric field; a vector potential is also required.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the finite speed of light, meaning the field observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* was generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*.\n\nThe retarded time *tr* is defined implicitly by the relation $t - t_r = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$, which states that the time difference is equal to the time it took for the electromagnetic signal to travel from the charge's position at *tr* to the observation point.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, the terms in the square brackets are evaluated at the retarded time *tr*. The notation is as follows:\n*   $\\vec{R}$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, which corresponds to $\\vec{d}$ in the problem statement.\n*   $R$ is the magnitude of $\\vec{R}$, corresponding to $d$.\n*   $\\hat{n}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{R}$, so $\\hat{n} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n*   $\\vec{\\beta}$ is the velocity of the charge normalized by the speed of light, $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n\nSubstituting the problem's notation into the denominator term $R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n$d(1 - (\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c)) = d(1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}) = d(\\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}) = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the potentials using this result:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option A. It is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which holds true for the expressions in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the finite speed of light, which means the fields observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* were generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time is determined by the condition that the time difference $t - t_r$ is equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$, which is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. This can be written as:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe derivation of the potentials involves integrating the retarded charge and current densities. A key factor that emerges from this derivation is a term in the denominator that accounts for the motion of the source during the emission of the signal.\n\nThe scalar potential V is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\nwhere $\\vec{n} = \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d}$ is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n\nSubstituting $\\vec{n}$ and simplifying the denominator gives:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSo, the scalar potential becomes:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese two potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Comparing these derived expressions with the given options, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nLet's define the terms according to the problem statement:\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: the trajectory of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: the time of observation.\n*   `tr`: the retarded time, which is the time at which the field observed at `(r, t)` was emitted by the charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(tr)$: the position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=tr}$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$: the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |\\vec{d}|`: the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `c`: the speed of light in vacuum.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$: the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$: the permeability of free space.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the observation time `t` and the retarded time `tr` is that the time difference must be equal to the time it takes for light to travel the distance `d`:\n$t - tr = \\frac{d}{c}$  or  $t = tr + \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from the general retarded potential formulas for continuous charge and current distributions:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge, the charge and current densities are given by Dirac delta functions:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas and performing the integration (which is non-trivial due to the time dependence in the delta function's argument) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The standard result of this derivation is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThe term $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, including the Doppler effect. The vector $\\vec{d}$ points from the source to the observer. If the charge is moving towards the observer, $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$, the denominator decreases, and the potential is larger. If the charge moves away, $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} < 0$, the denominator increases, and the potential is smaller. This confirms the negative sign.\n\nNow, let's manipulate these expressions to match the format of the given options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nAlso, note that we can relate $\\vec{A}$ and $V$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\nSince $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we have:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n\nNow let's compare our results with the given options:\n\nA) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\nIncorrect.

We want to find the potentials at a specific field point $\\vec{r}$ at a specific time `t` (the observer).\n2.  **Retardation:** Electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. The field observed at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was not generated by the charge at its present position $\\vec{s}(t)$, but by the charge at some earlier position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ at an earlier time $t_r$. This earlier time is called the **retarded time**.\n3.  **Causality Condition:** The time delay $(t - t_r)$ is exactly the time it takes for light to travel the distance from the source's position at $t_r$ to the observer's position $\\vec{r}$. This distance is given by the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    Therefore, the fundamental relationship defining the retarded time $t_r$ is:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$\n    where $d = |\\vec{d}|$. This is an implicit equation for $t_r$.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nThe scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ for a general time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Formulas to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge `q` with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas leads to the well-known **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. The derivation involves a careful evaluation of the integral with the delta function, where the retarded time itself depends on the integration variable. The standard result of this derivation is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, all quantities inside the brackets on the right-hand side ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Expressions and Compare with Options\n\nLet's manipulate the derived formulas to match the format of the given options.\n1.  **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    Multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n2.  **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    Multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Careful Points and Options\n\n*   **The Sign in the Denominator:** The term `(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})` is crucial. The negative sign is correct. It accounts for the \"bunching up\" of the field lines when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$, denominator gets smaller, potential gets stronger) and the \"spreading out\" when it moves away ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} < 0$, denominator gets larger, potential gets weaker). A positive sign would describe an unphysical advanced potential.\n*   **Relationship between V and $\\vec{A}$:** Notice that $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}{1} \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r},t)$. Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, this means $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is a fundamental relationship for Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A)** Has `+` in the denominator. This is incorrect. It would correspond to advanced potentials.\n    *   **B)** Uses the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect as it neglects retardation. The relationship between A and V is also dimensionally wrong.\n    *   **C)** Uses the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is formally correct for the true potentials, the expression for V itself is wrong.\n    *   **D)** The expressions for both V and $\\vec{A}$ match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly. They have the correct form, the correct `c` factors, and the crucial negative sign in the denominator.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) are given in option D.\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions correctly account for the finite speed of light and the motion of the source charge.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The solution involves applying the general formulas for retarded potentials to the specific case of a point charge.\n\n### 1. Definitions and Setup\n\nLet's define the key quantities based on the problem description:\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q`.\n*   **Trajectory:** The position of the charge at any time `t'` is given by the vector function $\\vec{s}(t')$.\n*   **Velocity:** The velocity of the charge at time `t'` is $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$.\n*   **Observation Point:** The potentials are measured at position $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The field observed at `(r, t)` was emitted by the charge at an earlier time, `t_r`. This \"retarded time\" is determined by the condition that the time difference `t - t_r` must be equal to the time it takes light to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r`.\n    *   Position of the charge at the retarded time: $\\vec{s}_r = \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   Vector from the retarded position to the observation point: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}_r$.\n    *   Distance from the retarded position to the observation point: $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}_r|$.\n    *   The retardation condition is: $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials for a time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\vec{v}(t') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 3. Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nSubstituting the delta-function densities into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the argument of $\\rho$ and $\\vec{J}$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often shown in advanced E&M textbooks) leads to the following result.\n\nThe effect of the motion of the charge is to modify the effective distance in the denominator. The standard Coulomb potential $q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 d)$ is modified by a factor related to the Doppler effect. The result of the integration is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nwhere $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nNow, we can manipulate the expressions to match the format given in the options. Let's focus on the denominator:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expressions for V and A:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential A:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option A.\n\n*   **Option A:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   This is a perfect match with our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n*   **Option B:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   The scalar potential is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect as it neglects retardation and the motion effect in the denominator. The relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, but the formula for V itself is wrong.\n\n*   **Option C:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   Incorrect scalar potential and incorrect (and dimensionally flawed) relation between $\\vec{A}$ and V.\n\n*   **Option D:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   The sign in the denominator is incorrect. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like compression or stretching of the \"space\" from which the field emanates.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly states the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived directly from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe core of the derivation involves evaluating the potentials at the observation point `r` and time `t` by considering the state of the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. The retarded time is defined such that a light signal emitted from the charge at `tr` from position `s(tr)` reaches the observer at `r` at time `t`. This is expressed by the relation `t - tr = d/c`, where `d = |r - s(tr)|` is the distance the signal travels.\n\nThe derivation results in the following expressions for the scalar and vector potentials:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    The scalar potential is given by the formula:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    where the quantities in the bracket are all evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. By multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`, we can rewrite this as:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This expression matches the scalar potential given in option C.\n\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    Similarly, the vector potential is found to be:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    Again, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` yields:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This expression matches the vector potential in option C.\n\nFurthermore, it can be shown that the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by the expression $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's verify this for the given expressions in option C:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\cdot \\dfrac{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}{qc} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}$\nUsing the fundamental relation $c^2 = \\dfrac{1}{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}$, we get:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\vec{v} \\implies \\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\nThis confirms the internal consistency of the expressions in option C.\n\nOptions A and B incorrectly use the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the effects of retardation. Option D has an incorrect sign in the denominator. Therefore, option C provides the correct expressions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\nThe electromagnetic fields (and potentials) at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ are not determined by the state of the source charge at time $t$, but by its state at an earlier time, called the **retarded time** ($t_r$). This is because electromagnetic disturbances propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light $c$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the condition that the time it takes for light to travel from the source's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is exactly $t - t_r$.\nLet the trajectory of the charge $q$ be $\\vec{s}(t)$. The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe distance is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\nThe retardation condition is therefore:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} \\bigg|_{t=t_r}$.\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Potentials (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials)\n\nThe general expressions for the potentials in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ and $d\\tau'$ is the volume element at the source point $\\vec{r}'$.\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\vec{v}(t') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation of the integral, which accounts for the \"compression\" of the apparent volume of the source due to its motion (a relativistic Doppler-like effect), yields the following results.\n\n### 3. Scalar Potential (V)\nThe integral for the scalar potential evaluates to:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nwhere $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$, and the subscript \"ret\" indicates that all quantities inside the bracket ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c}) = d - \\frac{d(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}/d)}{c} = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}$\nSo, the potential can be written as:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\nTo match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{c}{c} \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)\nSimilarly, the integral for the vector potential evaluates to:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nUsing the same denominator simplification as before:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Comparing with Options\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential form, which is not valid for a moving charge (unless $v=0$). The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally and conceptually incorrect.\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A plus sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which are generally considered unphysical.\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. Again, this uses the static form for $V$. While the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$ is actually correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials (as shown by comparing the expressions in option B), the expression for $V$ itself is wrong, making the entire option incorrect as an answer to the question.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   **Observer:** Located at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n*   **Retardation:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ and an earlier time `t_r`. This is the \"retarded time\".\n*   **Key Vectors and Scalars:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: Velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\nThe condition relating the observation time `t` and the retarded time `t_r` is that the time difference must be equal to the light travel time over the distance `d`:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Deriving the Potentials\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge. They are derived from the general retarded potential formulas for continuous charge and current distributions:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nFor a point charge `q`, the charge density is $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$ and the current density is $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n\nPerforming the integration with the Dirac delta function is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard derivation (found in textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") leads to the following result:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n\nHere, the subscript `ret` means all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `\\hat{d}`, `\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`. $\\hat{d}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$, i.e., $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n\n### 3. Matching with the Given Options\n\nLet's rewrite the derived potentials to match the format of the options. The key is the denominator term:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}) = d(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{d}/d)\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for V and A.\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\nTo eliminate the `c` in the denominator of the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and the main denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\nSimilarly, multiply the numerator and main denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n*   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect potential (uses instantaneous distance `r` instead of retarded distance `d`) and is only a quasi-static approximation.\n*   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect potential and incorrect relation for $\\vec{A}$.\n*   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Matches our derived expressions exactly.\n\nThe expressions in option D are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation:\n\n1.  **Retarded Potentials**: The foundation for calculating fields from time-varying sources is the concept of retarded potentials. Since electromagnetic influences travel at the speed of light, $c$, the potential at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ depends on the state of the source at an earlier, or **retarded time**, $t_r$. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it took for the signal to travel from the source to the field point.\n\n2.  **Source Definitions**:\n    *   Let the trajectory of the point charge $q$ be $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The distance this signal traveled is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is therefore $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: Solving the general retarded potential integrals for a moving point charge yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. A key feature of this result is a correction factor in the denominator that accounts for the motion of the source. The standard form of these potentials is:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n4.  **Comparing with the Options**: The given options are written in a slightly different algebraic form. We can rewrite our derived formulas to match the options. Let's focus on the denominator term:\n    \n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    By finding a common denominator, this becomes:\n\n    $\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the expressions for $V$ and $\\vec{A}$:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\left(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\left(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Final Check**:\n    *   These derived expressions match **Option A** perfectly.\n    *   Options B and C use the static Coulomb potential form, which is only valid for a stationary charge and ignores the crucial effects of retardation and source motion.\n    *   Option D has a plus sign ($+$) in the denominator instead of a minus sign ($-$). This corresponds to the non-physical \"advanced potentials,\" whereas the physical solution is the \"retarded potential.\"\n\nTherefore, Option A correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive these potentials from the fundamental formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Definition of Terms\n\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   `\\vec{r}`: The position vector of the point where the field is being observed (the field point).\n*   `t`: The time at which the field is observed.\n*   `t_r`: The retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at position `\\vec{r}` at time `t`.\n*   The signal travels at the speed of light `c`. The distance the signal travels is `|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`. The time taken is `t - t_r`. Therefore, the retarded time `t_r` is defined implicitly by the equation:\n    `c(t - t_r) = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`\n*   `\\vec{d}`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `t_r` to the observation point `\\vec{r}`.\n    `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)`\n*   `d`: The magnitude of the vector `\\vec{d}`.\n    `d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`\n    From the definition of retarded time, we have `d = c(t - t_r)`.\n*   `\\vec{v}`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `t_r`.\n    `\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}\\bigg|_{t'=t_r}`\n*   `\\epsilon_0`: Permittivity of free space.\n*   `\\mu_0`: Permeability of free space.\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials for a time-varying charge distribution `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')` and current distribution `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')` are the retarded potentials:\n\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'`\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'`\n\nwhere `t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n### 3. Potentials for a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `\\vec{s}(t)`, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n\n`\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n`\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))` where `\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'`.\n\nSubstituting these into the retarded potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `t_r` in the argument of `\\rho` and `\\vec{J}` depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`. A careful evaluation of the integral (often done by introducing another delta function for time and integrating over `t'` first) yields the following result:\n\nThe effective charge is modified by a kinematic factor that accounts for the fact that the volume element of the source is \"seen\" differently by the observer due to the source's motion (a Doppler-like effect). The denominator `|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|` is replaced by `[|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}')}{c|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|})]_{t_r}`.\n\nUsing the notation defined in Step 1:\n`[|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|]_{t_r} = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| = d`\n`[\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}']_{t_r} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r) = \\vec{d}`\n`[\\vec{v}]_{t_r} = \\vec{v}(t_r) = \\vec{v}`\n\nThe evaluation of the integral for the scalar potential gives:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{d}/(cd))}`\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}`\n\nTo match the format in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}`\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential, the integral yields:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{d}/(cd))}`\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}`\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}`\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`**\n    This exactly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n*   **B) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`**\n    The expression for `V` is the electrostatic potential, which ignores all retardation and motion effects. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`**\n    Similar to B, this uses the incorrect static potential for `V`. Although the relation `\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V` is correct for the true Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since `\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2`), the expressions given for `V` and `A` are wrong.\n\n*   **D) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`**\n    This option has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-` sign. The negative sign is crucial as it describes the Doppler effect: when the charge moves towards the observer (`\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v} > 0`), the denominator decreases, and the potential increases. The `+` sign would incorrectly describe the opposite effect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct representation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. The retarded time is defined by the condition that the time elapsed (`t - tr`) equals the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point, i.e., $t - t_r = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| / c = d/c$.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by the following expressions:\n\nThe scalar potential V is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\nAnd the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\nIn these expressions, all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe potentials are calculated at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, but they depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$. The retarded time is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The signal travels at the speed of light, $c$.\n\nLet the trajectory of the charge be $\\vec{s}(t)$. The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\nThe relationship between the observation time and the retarded time is given by $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nThe velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and are given by:\n\nScalar Potential:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nVector Potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThe presence of the term $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source. Specifically, it accounts for the fact that the volume of the charge distribution appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to the charge's motion.\n\nIt is also a known property that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ for a moving point charge by the following relation:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\nUsing the relationship $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$, we can verify this from the expressions above:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\n\nNow, let's compare these correct expressions with the given options:\nA) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: This expression is for a quasi-static case and does not correctly account for the retardation effect in the denominator.\nB) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: This has an incorrect positive sign in the denominator.\nC) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: This is incorrect for multiple reasons, including the use of `r` instead of the retarded distance and an incorrect form for the vector potential.\nD) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: These expressions match the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct formulas for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe key principle is that electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light, *c*. Therefore, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* are determined by the state of the charge *q* at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*. The retarded time is when the electromagnetic signal was generated, such that it arrives at $\\vec{r}$ exactly at time *t*. This condition is expressed as $t - tr = d/c$, where *d* is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$ from the charge's position at the retarded time, $\\vec{s}(tr)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials from Maxwell's equations yields the following expressions:\n\nThe scalar potential is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAnd the vector potential is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nHere, all quantities related to the charge (its position, which determines $\\vec{d}$, and its velocity $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time *tr*.\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can manipulate the denominator:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese results match the expressions provided in option D. It is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential can be related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$, which is satisfied by the expressions in option D when using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o\\mu_o)$.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ and $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential $V$ and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nLet's start with the general formulas for retarded potentials for a localized charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time.\n\nFor a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard procedure to evaluate these integrals leads to the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe procedure involves a change of variables and careful evaluation using the properties of the delta function. The result of this derivation is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, the notation \"[]$_{t_r}$\" means that all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. Let's translate this into the notation given in the problem:\n- The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n- The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n- The vector from the source at $t_r$ to the observer at $\\vec{r}$ is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n- The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n- The unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$ is $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n- The retarded time $t_r$ is implicitly defined by the relation $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nNow let's rewrite the potential expressions using this notation. The factor in the denominator is:\n$d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\nSubstituting this into the expressions for V and A:\n\nScalar Potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nVector Potential A:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese derived expressions match exactly with option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\nA) These are potentials in the quasi-static approximation, ignoring the full retardation effect in the denominator. This is incorrect.\nB) This option has a plus sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$). This would correspond to advanced potentials, which violate causality (effect precedes cause). The physically correct solution uses retarded potentials, which have a minus sign.\nC) The expression for V is incorrect (quasi-static), and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is dimensionally incorrect and structurally wrong ($\\vec{v}^2$ is a scalar).\n\nTherefore, option D correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. It's also useful to note that for these potentials, the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$ holds, because $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$. Option D satisfies this relationship:\n$\\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key to solving this is understanding the concept of \"retarded time\". Because electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light `c`, the fields observed at a point `r` at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time `tr`, called the retarded time.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define Retarded Time (tr):** The retarded time `tr` is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position `s(tr)` to reach the observation point `r` at the current time `t`. The relationship is given by:\n    `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n2.  **Define Key Vectors:**\n    *   `s(tr)`: Position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `v = ds/dt |_(t=tr)`: Velocity of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   `d = |d|`: The magnitude of this vector, which is the distance the signal traveled. So, `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n3.  **Retarded Potentials:** The general formulas for the potentials from time-varying charge and current distributions are:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\n4.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge, the charge and current densities are `ρ(r', tr) = q * δ(r' - s(tr))` and `J(r', tr) = q * v(tr) * δ(r' - s(tr))`. Performing the integration over the delta functions is not straightforward because the retarded time `tr` itself depends on `r'`. The result of this integration (which accounts for the relativistic compression of the volume element) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (v ⋅ d) / c)]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (v ⋅ d) / c)]`\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** To match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator:\n    `d - (v ⋅ d) / c = (1/c) * (cd - v ⋅ d)`\n    Substituting this back into the potential equations:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((1/c) * (cd - v ⋅ d))] = qc / (4πε₀ (cd - v ⋅ d))`\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / ((1/c) * (cd - v ⋅ d))] = (μ₀qc * v) / (4π (cd - v ⋅ d))`\n\n6.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   A) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d.v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc + d.v))` - The sign in the denominator is `+`, which is incorrect.\n    *   B) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d.v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d.v))` - This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   C) & D) These options use the static potential `V = q / (4πε₀ r)`, which is incorrect for a moving charge whose fields are observed at a distance.

We need to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n\nThe most important concept here is the **retarded time**. Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light `c`, the fields observed at `(r, t)` are not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time, `tr`, called the retarded time. The time difference `t - tr` is exactly the time it took for the signal (the field) to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\n### Step 2: Defining Variables and the Retarded Time Condition\n\nLet's formally define the variables based on the problem description:\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n*   `r`: The position vector of the field observation point.\n*   `t`: The time of observation.\n*   `tr`: The retarded time (the time the signal was emitted).\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `v = ds/dt |_(t=tr)`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`: The distance the signal traveled.\n*   `c`: The speed of light in vacuum.\n*   `ε₀`: The permittivity of free space.\n*   `μ₀`: The permeability of free space.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined by the implicit equation:\n`t - tr = d / c`\nThis equation states that the time interval equals the light-travel time over the distance `d`.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe general formulas for the retarded potentials for continuous charge and current densities (`ρ` and `J`) are:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge, we have `ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))` and `J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas and performing the integration (which is non-trivial due to the `r'` dependence in `tr`) yields the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The result of the integration.** A standard derivation in electromagnetism textbooks (like Griffiths, Chapter 10) shows that the time dependence of the source's position within the delta function introduces a correction factor in the denominator.\n\nThe resulting scalar potential is:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c))]_ret`\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observer, and all quantities (`d`, `d`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\nLet's simplify this expression:\n`d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c) = d - d(d̂ ⋅ v/c) = d - (d ⋅ v)/c`\nSo, `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * qc / (cd - d ⋅ v)`\nThis is the Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The sign in the denominator.** The term `d ⋅ v` represents the component of the charge's velocity along the line of sight to the observer. If the charge is moving towards the observer, this term is positive (as `d = r - s(tr)`, the vector `d` points towards the observer while `v` is shortening that distance), which makes the denominator smaller and the potential stronger (a Doppler-like effect). The minus sign is physically correct.\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential is found to be:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c))]_ret`\n\nSimplifying this expression in the same way:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * q v / (d - d ⋅ v / c)`\nAnd multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qc v / (cd - d ⋅ v)`\nThis is the Liénard-Wiechert vector potential.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Relationship between V and A.**\nNotice that we can write the vector potential `A` in terms of the scalar potential `V`.\nFrom our derived formulas:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (Denominator)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (Denominator)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) / (1 / 4πε₀) * v * V(r, t) = (μ₀ ε₀) v V(r, t)`\nUsing the relation `c² = 1 / (μ₀ ε₀)`, we get:\n`A(r, t) = (v / c²) V(r, t)`\nThis provides a useful consistency check.\n\n### Step 4: Comparing with the Given Options\n\nLet's analyze the options based on our derived potentials.\n\n*   **Our derived expressions:**\n    *   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n    *   `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\n*   **Option A:** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`\n    *   `V` is the simple static potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge. `A` is also incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`\n    *   `V` is incorrect. While the relation between `A` and `V` looks correct, it's applied to the wrong `V`.\n\n*   **Option C:** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n    *   The expression for `V` matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential.\n    *   The expression for `A` matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert vector potential.\n    *   Let's check the consistency: `A = (v/c²)V`.\n        *   `(v/c²)V = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀(dc - d⋅v))] = qv / (4πε₀c(dc - d⋅v))`\n        *   Rewriting `A` from the option using `μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²)`:\n        *   `A = [1/(ε₀c²)] * qcv / (4π(dc - d⋅v)) = qv / (4πε₀c(dc - d⋅v))`\n        *   They are consistent.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's break down the derivation and reasoning.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Concepts\n\n*   **Source and Field Points:** A point charge $q$ is at position $\\vec{s}(t)$ at time $t$. We want to find the potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, $c$. The effect felt at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ is due to the state of the charge at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the retarded time. The time delay $(t - t_r)$ is the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the field point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   **Vector Definitions:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the field point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the retarded position to the field point.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t)}{dt} \\bigg|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n*   **Retarded Time Equation:** The time delay is given by the distance divided by the speed of light:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$ or $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general formulas for retarded potentials by treating the charge as a delta-function charge distribution and a corresponding current distribution.\n\n*   Scalar Potential ($V$):\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n*   Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nFor a point charge $q$ with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are:\n*   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas is not trivial because the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation of the integral (often done in advanced E&M textbooks like Griffiths or Jackson) yields a correction factor in the denominator. This factor accounts for the fact that the volume of the charge distribution appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)| - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r))}{c}} \\right]$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}(t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)| - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r))}{c}} \\right]$\n\n### 3. Applying the Problem's Notation\n\nNow, let's substitute the notation given in the problem statement into these standard forms:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity at $t_r$.\n\nThe denominator becomes:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})$\n\nSubstituting this into the potential expressions:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})} \\right] = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})} \\right] = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Comparing with Options\n\nLet's compare these derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}}$\n    This matches our derived results exactly.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)}$**\n    This is incorrect. It uses the static potential and has a dimensionally incorrect form for $\\vec{A}$.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}}$\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A plus sign would correspond to \"advanced potentials\" which are generally considered unphysical. The minus sign is correct for the retarded (physical) potentials.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    This is incorrect. It uses the static potential, failing to account for retardation. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for $V$ itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, *c*. Therefore, the field experienced at an observation point **r** at time *t* was generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *t*<sub>r</sub>.\n\nThe correct expressions must depend on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at this retarded time. The scalar and vector potentials are given by the following formulas:\n\nThe scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{|\\vec{d}| - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThe vector potential is related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. Substituting the expression for V and using the relation $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}$, we can write the vector potential as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{d}| - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of these expressions by *c*:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{|\\vec{d}|c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{d}|c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nUsing the problem's notation where $d = |\\vec{d}|$, these expressions become:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese formulas precisely match option B. The denominator term, $(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, is a crucial component that arises from evaluating the effect of the moving source at the retarded time. Options A and C are incorrect because they use the static potential form, which does not account for the charge's motion or retardation effects. Option D is incorrect due to the positive sign in the denominator, which is inconsistent with the Liénard-Wiechert formulation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe key is to evaluate the charge density and current at the \"retarded time\" `tr`. The retarded time is the instant in the past when the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observer at position `$\\vec{r}$` at time `t`. It is defined by the relation: `t - tr = d/c`, where `d` is the magnitude of the vector `$\\vec{d}$`, which points from the charge's position at the retarded time, `$\\vec{s}(tr)$`, to the observation point `$\\vec{r}$`.\n\nThe correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by:\n\nScalar Potential (V):\n`$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$`\n\nVector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):\n`$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$`\n\nThe subscript `$t_r$` indicates that all quantities inside the brackets—`d`, `$\\vec{d}$`, and `$\\vec{v}$`—are evaluated at the retarded time.\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n`$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$`\n\n`$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$`\n\nThese expressions match option D. The term `$(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$` in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, similar to a Doppler effect. The other options are incorrect because they either use the wrong sign in the denominator or use the static potential form, which does not account for retardation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

Let's analyze the provided options based on the standard formulas for Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe scalar potential `V` is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c)}$\nwhere all quantities on the right, such as the separation vector $\\vec{d}$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$, are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\nBy multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`, this expression can be rewritten as:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential `V` by the expression:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n\nSubstituting the expression for `V` and the relation $\\mu_o = 1/(\\epsilon_o c^2)$, we get:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nComparing these derived formulas with the given options:\n*   **A) and B)** are incorrect because they represent the static or non-relativistic potential and do not account for the retardation effects in the denominator.\n*   **C)** correctly presents both the scalar potential `V` and the vector potential `A` derived from the Liénard-Wiechert formulas.\n*   **D)** is incorrect due to the positive sign in the denominator. The Doppler-like factor $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ correctly features a minus sign.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Setup**\n    *   We have a point charge `q` moving along a path described by the vector function `s(t)`.\n    *   We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at a specific observation point `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n    *   Electromagnetic signals (and thus the influence of the charge) travel at the speed of light, `c`. This means the potentials at `(r, t)` are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, called the *retarded time*, `tr`.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is the time at which the signal must have been emitted from the charge's position `s(tr)` to reach the observation point `r` at time `t`. The relationship is given by:\n        `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n2.  **Defining Key Vectors and Quantities**\n    *   **Source position at retarded time:** `s(tr)`.\n    *   **Vector from source to observer:** The problem defines this vector as `d`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   **Distance from source to observer:** The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d|`.\n    *   **Velocity of the charge at retarded time:** `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n    *   The retarded time condition can be rewritten using our notation: `t - tr = d / c`.\n\n3.  **Retarded Potential Integrals**\n    For a general time-varying charge density `rho(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')`, the retarded potentials are given by:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) ∫ [rho(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    where `tr = t - |r - r'|/c` is the retarded time for each source point `r'`.\n\n4.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a point charge `q` moving along `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    *   `rho(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n    *   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n    Substituting these into the potential integrals is complex because the retarded time `tr` in the argument of the delta function also depends on the integration variable `r'`. A standard, but non-trivial, evaluation of these integrals (found in advanced electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") yields the following results, known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**:\n\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) * [q / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]_ret`\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) * [q * v / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]_ret`\n\n    The `_ret` subscript signifies that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `d̂`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    Here, `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded source position to the observation point.\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expressions**\n    Let's focus on the denominator term:\n    `d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c) = d * (1 - ( (d/d) ⋅ v )/c) = d - (d ⋅ v)/c`\n\n    Now, substitute this simplified denominator back into the potential equations:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) * [q / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c)]`\n\n    To match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) * [qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n\n    Similarly, for the vector potential `A`:\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c)]`\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) * [qc * v / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n\n6.  **Comparing with the Given Options**\n\n    Let's examine the options provided:\n    *   A) Incorrect form for V (static potential) and incorrect relation for A.\n    *   B) Same form as our result, but with a `+` sign in the denominator (`dc + d.v`). This is incorrect; the sign is `-`. The sign accounts for the Doppler-like effect; when the charge moves towards the observer (`d.v` > 0), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential stronger.\n    *   C) Incorrect form for V (static potential). While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for `V` itself is wrong.\n    *   D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πεo * (dc - d⋅v))` and `A(r,t) = μo qc v / (4π * (dc - d⋅v))`.\n\n    These expressions exactly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The notation in the option matches the standard derivation perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential (A) of a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's analyze the problem based on the principles of classical electrodynamics.\n\n### 1. Understanding Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the potential measured at a specific point `r` and time `t` is not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time, `t_r`, called the **retarded time**. The time delay `t - t_r` is exactly the time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r`.\n\nLet's define the key vectors and scalars based on the problem description:\n*   `s(t_r)`: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `t_r`.\n*   `r`: The position of the observer (the field point).\n*   `d = r - s(t_r)`: The vector pointing from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d| = |r - s(t_r)|`: The distance between the retarded position and the observation point.\n*   `v = ds/dt |_(t=t_r)`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `t_r`.\n*   `c`: The speed of light.\n\nThe condition for the retarded time `t_r` is given by the relation:\n`t - t_r = d / c`\n\n### 2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential formulas:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are given by:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n\nEvaluating these integrals is a standard but non-trivial procedure in electromagnetism. The result of this evaluation yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The standard forms are:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d(1 - (n · v)/c))]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d(1 - (n · v)/c))]`\n\nwhere `n = d / d` is the unit vector in the direction of `d`.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Expressions\n\nLet's simplify the denominator term in the standard formulas:\n`d(1 - (n · v)/c) = d - d * (n · v)/c = d - (d · v)/c`\n\nSo the potentials can be written as:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d · v)/c)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (d · v)/c)]`\n\n### 4. Comparing with the Given Options\n\nNow, let's examine the expressions provided in the options.\n\n*   **Options A and B:** These suggest `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it does not account for retardation effects.\n*   **Option D:** This option has a `+` sign in the denominator: `(dc + d · v)`. This corresponds to \"advanced potentials\", which would mean the effect precedes the cause. These are generally considered unphysical solutions. The condition `t > t_r` implies we are looking for the retarded (causal) solution.\n*   **Option C:**\n    `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))`\n    `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))`\n\nLet's manipulate the denominator of option C to compare it with our standard form:\n`dc - d · v = c * (d - (d · v)/c)`\n\nNow substitute this back into the expressions from Option C:\n*   For `V(r,t)`:\n    `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ * c(d - (d · v)/c)) = q / (4πε₀ (d - (d · v)/c))`\n    This matches the standard Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential.\n\n*   For `A(r,t)`:\n    `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π * c(d - (d · v)/c)) = (μ₀q v) / (4π (d - (d · v)/c))`\n    This matches the standard Liénard-Wiechert vector potential.\n\n### 5. Final Check\n\nAs a consistency check, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by `A = (v/c²)V`. Let's verify this for Option C.\n`A / V = [μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))] / [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))]`\n`A / V = (μ₀qc v / 4π) * (4πε₀ / qc) = μ₀ε₀v`\nUsing the relation `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, we get `μ₀ε₀ = 1/c²`.\nTherefore, `A / V = v/c²`, which confirms `A = (v/c²)V`.\n\nThe expressions in option C are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials, just written in a slightly different but algebraically equivalent form.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key concept is \"retardation,\" which accounts for the finite time it takes for electromagnetic effects to propagate at the speed of light, $c$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understanding Retardation:** The potential measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is not caused by the charge's properties at time $t$, but by its properties at an earlier **retarded time**, $t_r$. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Defining Variables:** Based on the problem description:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge $q$ at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$ is the observation point.\n    *   $t$ is the observation time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the moment of emission to the point of observation.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance this signal travels.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n    The retarded time $t_r$ is implicitly defined by the light-travel condition:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard derivation from the general retarded potential formulas for a point charge gives the following results for the scalar potential $V$ and vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n\n    Note: All quantities in the denominators ($d$, $\\vec{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The negative sign in the denominator is characteristic of the retarded (causal) potential. A positive sign would represent a non-physical \"advanced\" potential.\n\n4.  **Formatting the Expression:** The options in the question are presented in a slightly different algebraic form. We can manipulate our expressions to match them. Let's work on the denominator:\n    Denominator = $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    To get the term `dc` that appears in the options, we can factor out $1/c$ from the denominator:\n    Denominator = $\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the expressions for $V$ and $\\vec{A}$:\n    For the scalar potential $V$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect sign in the denominator (`+` instead of `-`).\n    *   B) Incorrect form for $V$ (static potential), ignores retardation and velocity effects in the denominator.\n    *   C) Incorrect form for both $V$ and $\\vec{A}$.\n    *   D) The expressions for $V$ and $\\vec{A}$ perfectly match our derived results.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:** The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. The key idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the field observed at a point `r` at time `t` was not generated by the charge at its current position and time, but at an earlier position and an earlier time, known as the **retarded time**.\n\n2.  **Define Variables and Relationships:**\n    *   `q`: The point charge.\n    *   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: The time of observation.\n    *   `tr`: The retarded time, which is the time at which the field was generated.\n    *   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `d`: The vector from the source's retarded position to the observation point. `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   `d = |d|`: The distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n3.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the signal to travel from the source at `s(tr)` to the observer at `r` is `d/c`. This must be equal to the time difference `t - tr`.\n    *   `t - tr = d / c`\n    *   This equation implicitly defines `tr` for a given `r` and `t`.\n\n4.  **Starting Point: The Retarded Potentials:** The general solutions for the potentials in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are the retarded potentials:\n    *   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   where `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\n5.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `s(t)`, the densities are:\n    *   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))` (where `δ³` is the 3D Dirac delta function)\n    *   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Scalar Potential (V):**\n    *   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(tr)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   This integral is complicated because the retarded time `tr = t - |r - r'| / c` depends on the integration variable `r'`.\n    *   A standard derivation (e.g., in Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") shows that this dependence introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The volume of the source appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion.\n    *   The result of the integration is:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d * (1 - (d̂ · v)/c))]`\n        where `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observer. The quantities `d`, `d`, and `v` are all evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   Let's simplify the denominator:\n        `d * (1 - (d̂ · v)/c) = d * (1 - (d · v)/(d * c)) = d - (d · v)/c = (cd - d · v) / c`\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for V:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((cd - d · v) / c)]`\n        `V(r, t) = (qc) / (4πε₀ (cd - d · v))`\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Vector Potential (A):**\n    *   We follow a similar procedure for `A(r, t)`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [q * v(tr) * δ³(r' - s(tr)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   Since `v(tr)` is evaluated at the retarded time, it is constant with respect to the integration variable `r'` and can be taken out of the integral.\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * v / 4π) ∫ [δ³(r' - s(tr)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   The integral is exactly the same one we encountered for V, but without the `q/ε₀` factor. Its value is `1 / (d - (d · v)/c)`.\n    *   So, `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * v / 4π) * [1 / (d - (d · v)/c)]`\n    *   Using the simplified denominator from the previous step:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * v / 4π) * [1 / ((cd - d · v) / c)]`\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * c * v) / (4π (cd - d · v))`\n\n8.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   The derived expressions are:\n        `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))`\n        `A(r, t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))`\n    *   These expressions exactly match option D.\n\n9.  **Checking the Relationship between A and V:**\n    *   It is a known result for Liénard-Wiechert potentials that `A = (v/c²) V`. Let's verify this.\n    *   `(v/c²) V = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))] = qv / (4πε₀c (dc - d · v))`\n    *   Now let's simplify our expression for A using the relation `c² = 1/(ε₀μ₀)`, which means `μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²)`.\n    *   `A = ( (1/(ε₀c²)) qc v) / (4π (dc - d · v)) = (qv / (ε₀c)) / (4π (dc - d · v)) = qv / (4πε₀c (dc - d · v))`\n    *   The expressions match, confirming the self-consistency of our results and their relation.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which correspond to option D. The negative sign in the denominator (`dc - d · v`) is crucial and arises from the retardation effect.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

They are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the potential at an observation point `r` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `t_r`.\n\nThe key variables as defined in the problem are:\n*   `q`: the point charge\n*   $\\vec{r}$: the field point (observation point)\n*   $t$: the time of observation\n*   $t_r$: the retarded time, when the signal was emitted\n*   $\\vec{d}$: the vector from the charge's retarded position, $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the field point $\\vec{r}$. So, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\nThe condition `t > t_r` ensures causality, and the relationship between these times is given by the time it takes for light to travel the distance $d$:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by the following expressions:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\nThe standard formula for the scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\nThe subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]_{t_r}$\nThis matches the expression for the scalar potential in option C.\n\n**Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\nThe standard formula for the vector potential is:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` yields:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]_{t_r}$\nThis expression is identical to the vector potential in option C.\n\nFurthermore, the scalar and vector potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nLet's define the terms as given in the problem:\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   `s(t)`: the position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   `r`: the position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `tr`: the retarded time, which is the time at which the field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge.\n*   `d`: the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time, `s(tr)`, to the observation point `r`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   `d`: the magnitude of the vector `d`, so `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   `v`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`, so `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   `c`: the speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   `ε₀`: the permittivity of free space.\n*   `μ₀`: the permeability of free space.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined implicitly by the condition that the signal (electromagnetic field) travels from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r` in the time interval `t - tr`. Since the signal travels at the speed of light `c`, we have:\n`d = c(t - tr)`\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\nwhere the quantities in the square brackets `[]` are evaluated at the retarded time `t' = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)` and velocity `v(t) = s'(t)`, the charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals and evaluating them (a standard but non-trivial derivation found in electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\", Chapter 10) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe evaluation of the integral effectively replaces the volume element `d³r'` with a term that accounts for the motion of the source during the emission of the signal. The result is a factor of `1 / (1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c)`, where `d̂ = d/d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position of the charge to the observer.\n\nThe scalar potential `V` is:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c)))`\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n`d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c) = d - (d * d̂) ⋅ v/c = d - d ⋅ v/c`\n\nSo, `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (d - d ⋅ v/c))`\n\nTo match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (qc / (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nThe vector potential `A` is found similarly:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c)))`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v / (d - d ⋅ v/c))`\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (qc v / (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nIt is also useful to note the relationship between `A` and `V`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ε₀ v) * (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (d - d ⋅ v/c))`\nUsing `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, this becomes:\n`A(r, t) = (v/c²) V(r, t)`\n\nNow let's compare our results with the given options:\n\n**A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c - d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (d c - d⋅v))**\nThis exactly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nB) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r),  A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)\nThis is incorrect. The potential is not the static Coulomb potential (which depends on the instantaneous distance, not the retarded distance `d`, and doesn't account for the velocity correction factor). Also, the relation `A = (v²/c²)V` is dimensionally incorrect as `A` is a vector and `v²` is a scalar.\n\nC) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)\nThis is also incorrect. Although the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` is formally correct, the expression for `V` is the static one and is wrong for a general moving charge.\n\nD) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c + d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (d c + d⋅v))\nThis has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-`. The minus sign is crucial as it describes the Doppler-like effect: when the charge moves towards the observer (`d⋅v > 0`), the potential is stronger, and when it moves away (`d⋅v < 0`), the potential is weaker. A plus sign would incorrectly reverse this physical effect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct one.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

They are derived directly from Maxwell's equations.\n\nThe calculation must account for the \"retarded time\" ($t_r$), which is the time at which the electromagnetic field was emitted from the charge to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The signal travels at the speed of light, c, so the time delay is the distance traveled divided by c. This relationship is expressed as:\n\n$t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| / c$\n\nIn the notation of the problem, this becomes:\n\n$t - t_r = d / c$, where $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by the following formulas, where all quantities related to the charge (position, velocity) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n\nThe scalar potential V is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nComparing these standard forms with the given options, we find that option C matches these expressions.\n\nIt's also worth noting the relationship between the vector and scalar potentials:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n\nLet's verify this for option C.\nFrom option C, we have:\n$\\vec{A}/V = (\\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}) / (\\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})})$\n$\\vec{A}/V = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}$\n\nSince $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we get:\n$\\vec{A}/V = \\vec{v}/c^2$, which confirms the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the expressions in option C are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the core concepts:** The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) produced by a moving point charge. These are fundamental quantities in electromagnetism known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. They are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in motion.\n\n2.  **The Role of Retarded Time:** Because electromagnetic interactions propagate at the finite speed of light, $c$, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ do not depend on the charge's position at time $t$, but on its position and velocity at an earlier, or \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The time difference, $t-t_r$, is the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer's position at $t$.\n\n3.  **Define Variables based on the Problem:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge $q$ at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position of the observer (the field point).\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observer.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The magnitude of this vector, i.e., the distance.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is given by: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n4.  **State the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    The term in the denominator, $d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c$, accounts for the fact that the volume element of the charge appears compressed or expanded from the observer's point of view due to the charge's motion (a relativistic effect related to the Doppler shift).\n\n5.  **Simplify and Compare with Options:** To match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fractions by $c$:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** These derived expressions exactly match the formulas given in **Option B**.\n    *   Options A and D represent static or quasi-static approximations, which are incorrect for a general moving charge.\n    *   Option C has an incorrect sign in the denominator, which would lead to unphysical results (e.g., a weaker field for a charge approaching the observer).\n\nThe correct choice is therefore B.

Understand the Setup**\n*   We have a point charge `q` with a time-dependent position vector `s(t)`.\n*   We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at a specific observation point `r` and time `t`.\n*   The electromagnetic field (and thus the potentials) that we observe at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, `tr`.\n*   The time difference `t - tr` is the time it takes for the signal to travel at the speed of light `c` from the source's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\n**2. Define Key Quantities**\n*   **Retarded position of the charge:** `s(tr)`.\n*   **Retarded velocity of the charge:** `v = ds(t')/dt' |_(t'=tr)`.\n*   **Vector from source to observer:** The problem defines `d` as the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   **Distance from source to observer:** The magnitude of the vector `d` is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   **Retarded time condition:** The time delay for the signal is `d/c`. Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is determined by the implicit equation:\n    `t - tr = d/c`  or  `tr = t - d/c = t - |r - s(tr)|/c`.\n\n**3. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials**\nThe solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials from a time-varying charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n*   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n*   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    where `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\n**4. Apply to a Point Charge**\nFor a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are given by Dirac delta functions:\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals (a non-trivial process that involves a change of variables and properties of the delta function) yields the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n**5. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\nThe result of the integration is:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]_tr`\n    The subscript `tr` means all quantities inside the bracket (`d`, `d`, `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    This expression can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)]_tr`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]_tr`\n    Similarly, rewriting this gives:\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (dc - d ⋅ v)]_tr`\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\nLet's analyze the options based on our derived expressions. Our notation (`d`, `d`, `v`, `tr`) matches that defined in the problem.\n\n*   **A) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)**\n    This is incorrect. The potential `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge. It also uses `r` (distance from origin) instead of `d` (distance from the retarded source position).\n\n*   **B) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc + d ⋅ v))**\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. It should be `(dc - d ⋅ v)`. A plus sign corresponds to advanced potentials, which are generally considered unphysical as they violate causality.\n\n*   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)**\n    This is incorrect. `V` is the static potential, and the relation for `A` is dimensionally and vectorially wrong (`A` is a vector, but `v²V` is a scalar).\n\n*   **D) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))**\n    This option perfectly matches the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    Let's also check the relationship between `A` and `V`. Using `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, we have `μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²)`.\n    `A = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n    `A = (1/(ε₀c²)) * (qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n    `A = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\n    `A = (v/c²) V`\n    The expressions in D are self-consistent and correct.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Option D provides the correct mathematical forms for these potentials using the specified notation.\n\nThe denominator term `(dc - d ⋅ v)` is a relativistic correction factor that accounts for the fact that the \"news\" from the moving charge is compressed or rarefied, similar to the Doppler effect for sound or light waves.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, so the field at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 1. Defining the Retarded Time\n\nThe retarded time, $t_r$, is the time at which the charge emitted the electromagnetic signal that reaches the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the later time $t$. The signal travels a distance $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ at the speed of light $c$. Therefore, the time taken for the signal to travel this distance is $d/c$. The relationship between the observation time and the retarded time is:\n\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nThis is an implicit equation for $t_r$.\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar and vector potentials from a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integration is complicated because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard procedure to evaluate this integral yields the following result:\n\nThe effective volume of the charge is compressed by a factor of $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})$, where $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nThe resulting potentials are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\nwhere all quantities in the brackets (d, $\\vec{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite the derived potentials to match the format of the given options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly for the vector potential:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option C.\n\n*   **Option A** gives the potentials for a static or slowly moving charge in the Coulomb gauge, which is incorrect for a generally moving charge.\n*   **Option B** has an incorrect form for both V and A.\n*   **Option C** matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The denominator $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ correctly captures the relativistic effects, including the Doppler shift.\n*   **Option D** has the incorrect sign in the denominator. A positive sign would imply a decrease in potential as the charge moves towards the observer, which is contrary to the physical effect.\n\nThus, option C provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the electromagnetic field at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$, generated by a charge $q$ that was at a \"retarded\" position at an earlier time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined implicitly by the condition that the time difference $t - t_r$ is equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the source's retarded position to the observation point. Using the notation provided in the question:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$, where $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| = |\\vec{d}|$.\n\nThe derivation of the potentials from Maxwell's equations accounts for the fact that the volume element of the moving charge appears compressed or expanded to the observer, which gives rise to a correction factor in the denominator of the potentials.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\n\nThese can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nIt's also a known relationship that for a moving point charge, the vector potential is related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o \\mu_o)$, we can verify that the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is consistent with the expression for $V$.\n\nComparing these derived forms with the given options:\n*   **A)** Has a plus sign in the denominator, which corresponds to advanced potentials (non-causal).\n*   **B)** Matches the derived expressions for the retarded (causal) scalar and vector potentials exactly.\n*   **C) and D)** Use the static Coulomb potential form for V, which is incorrect as it does not account for retardation effects due to the charge's motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, c, meaning the field experienced at a point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was generated by the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials starts from the general retarded potential formulas and applies them to a point charge. Let's analyze the expressions given in the options based on the standard form of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe standard formulas for the scalar potential ($V$ or $\\phi$) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) are often written as:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere:\n*   $R$ is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $\\vec{n}$ is the unit vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n*   The subscript $t_r$ means the quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time.\n\nNow, let's translate this into the notation provided in the question:\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector is $d$, so $R=d$.\n*   The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n*   The velocity of the charge is $\\vec{v}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the denominator term $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n$d \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\right) = d \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc} \\right) = d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nTo simplify, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\nFor the scalar potential $V$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that they match option C exactly. Option A has the wrong sign in the denominator. Options B and D use the static potential form, which is incorrect for a moving charge where retardation effects are significant. It is also worth noting that the vector and scalar potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$, which holds true for the expressions in option C, since $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nThe scalar and vector potentials, V and A respectively, for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and describe the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe derivation accounts for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. This means the field observed at position `\\vec{r}` and time `t` was generated by the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. The key is to evaluate the position and velocity of the charge at this retarded time.\n\nThe standard expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**  `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]`\n*   **Vector Potential (\\vec{A}):** `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]`\n\nIn these formulas, all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. The denominator can be rewritten as `(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) / c`.\n\nBy substituting this into the expressions, we get:\n*   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}`\n*   `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}`\n\nComparing these derived formulas with the given options, we find that they match option A. Option B uses the incorrect static potential, and option D has an incorrect sign in the denominator.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that due to the finite speed of light, the potentials at a field point `r` at time `t` depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 1. Define Key Quantities\n\n*   **q**: The electric charge.\n*   **`s(t)`**: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n*   **`r`**: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   **`tr`**: The retarded time. It's the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observation point `r` at time `t`. It is defined by the implicit equation:\n    `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n*   **`s(tr)`**: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   **`d`**: The vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point.\n    `d = r - s(tr)`\n*   **d**: The magnitude of `d`, i.e., the distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n    `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`\n*   **`v`**: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    `v = d(s)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   **c**: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   **ε₀**: The permittivity of free space.\n*   **μ₀**: The permeability of free space.\n\nFrom the definition of `tr`, we can write `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials Formulation\n\nThe general formulas for the scalar potential V and vector potential A for a time-varying charge density `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\n### 3. Application to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are represented using Dirac delta functions:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas requires careful evaluation due to the delta function's argument containing the integration variable implicitly through the retarded time. A standard derivation in electromagnetism textbooks (for example, by integrating over time `t'` first) yields the following results:\n\nThe integral for the scalar potential evaluates to:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot v/c))]`\nwhere `\\hat{d} = d / d`.\n\nThe integral for the vector potential evaluates to:\n`A(r,t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot v/c))]`\n\nAll quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, `\\hat{d}`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. Simplification and Comparison with Options\n\nLet's simplify the denominator of these expressions:\n`d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot v/c) = d(1 - (d/d) \\cdot (v/c)) = d - (d \\cdot v)/c`\n\nNow, we can rewrite the potentials:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d \\cdot v)/c)]`\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d \\cdot v)] = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d \\cdot v))`\n\nSimilarly for the vector potential A:\n`A(r,t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - (d \\cdot v)/c)]`\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n`A(r,t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qcv / (dc - d \\cdot v)] = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π(dc - d \\cdot v))`\n\nNow let's compare these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** `V(...) = ... / (dc + d·v)`, `A(...) = ... / (dc + d·v)`. The sign is incorrect. This would correspond to advanced potentials, not retarded potentials.\n*   **B)** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`. This matches our derived expressions perfectly.\n*   **C)** `V = q / (4πε₀r)`. This is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge. It ignores the effects of retardation and the velocity-dependent term in the denominator.\n*   **D)** `V = q / (4πε₀r)`, `A = (v²/c²)V`. The potential V is incorrect, and the expression for A is vectorially incorrect (`v²` is a scalar).\n\nThus, the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Concept: Retarded Potentials**\n    Because electromagnetic influences travel at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potential at a specific point in space `r` and time `t` does not depend on the *current* state of the charge, but on its state at an earlier, or **retarded time**, `t_r`. The retarded time is defined by the condition that the time difference, `t - t_r`, is exactly the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r`.\n\n2.  **Defining the Variables (as per the problem statement)**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `t_r`.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The field point where the potential is measured.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance the signal traveled.\n    *   The retarded time condition is: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} |_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n    The potentials are derived by solving the general retarded potential integral equations for the specific case of a point charge. This calculation yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The standard forms are:\n\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n    The term $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of retardation. The dot product $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ represents a Doppler-like effect; the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer and weaker if it is moving away.\n\n4.  **Matching the Formula to the Options**\n    The expressions in the options are written in a slightly different algebraic form. We can rewrite the standard formulas by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    Comparing these results with the given choices:\n    *   A) has the wrong sign in the denominator (`+` instead of `-`).\n    *   B) and C) use the simple static Coulomb potential form for `V`, which is incorrect as it neglects the velocity-dependent term in the denominator.\n    *   D) perfectly matches our derived expressions for both `V` and `A`.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Identify the Setup\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   **Observer:** Located at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`. The potentials at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, $t_r$. This is the time when the signal that reaches the observer at time `t` was emitted from the charge.\n*   **Retarded Position:** The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   **Vector from Source to Observer:** The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observer is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   **Retarded Velocity:** The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=t_r}$.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Time Condition\n\nThe time it takes for the signal to travel the distance `d` is $d/c$. This must equal the time difference between emission and observation:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nThis equation implicitly defines the retarded time $t_r$ for a given observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$. All quantities related to the source (its position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, velocity $\\vec{v}$, and the separation vector $\\vec{d}$) must be evaluated at this retarded time.\n\n### 3. The Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials from time-varying charge and current densities are the retarded potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} dV'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} dV'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge, the densities are:\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 4. Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nSubstituting these densities into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals is a non-trivial process because the retarded time depends on the integration variable. The key step involves a change of variables that introduces a correction factor.\n\nThe effect is that the charge `q` must be divided by a factor $1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}$, which accounts for the \"bunching up\" of the field lines due to the charge's motion (a Doppler-like effect). This factor is often written as $\\kappa = 1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c$.\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    The integral effectively evaluates to:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The subscript \"ret\" signifies that all quantities in the bracket ($d, \\hat{d}, \\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    Using the notation given in the problem, where $\\vec{d}$ and $\\vec{v}$ are already defined at $t_r$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - d(\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    To match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    The derivation is analogous. The source of the vector potential is the current $q\\vec{v}$.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    Again, using the problem's notation:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived results with the given options.\n\n*   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions perfectly match **Option A**.\n\n*   **Option B** is incorrect as it represents the static Coulomb potential, ignoring retardation and the effect of motion.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect because it has a `+` sign in the denominator. This would describe an \"advanced potential\" (determined by the charge's future state), which is physically rejected on grounds of causality.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect as it uses the static potential and has a physically nonsensical expression for $\\vec{A}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nThe scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

Recall or Derive the Standard Formulas\n\nUsing the notation provided in the problem, the standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials from Maxwell's equations yields:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nIn these expressions, all quantities on the right side ($d$, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 3. Reformat the Expressions to Match the Options\n\nThe given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm ...)$. We can manipulate our standard formulas to match this format by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n*   For the scalar potential V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{c \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n*   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Carefully Analyze Each Option\n\nNow we compare our derived formulas to the provided choices:\n\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**\n    This is **incorrect**. The plus sign `+` in the denominator corresponds to the non-physical \"advanced\" potentials, which violate causality (the effect would precede the cause). The physical, causal solution uses a minus sign.\n\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**\n    This is **correct**. These expressions perfectly match the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a retarded (causal) interaction. The minus sign correctly captures the Doppler-like effect: the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) and weaker if it is moving away.\n\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    This is **incorrect**. The scalar potential $V$ is given as the static Coulomb potential, which neglects all effects of retardation and motion. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally and vectorially wrong ($\\vec{v}^2$ is a scalar, but $\\vec{A}$ is a vector).\n\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    This is **incorrect**. Like option C, it uses the wrong formula for the scalar potential $V$. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$ is correct for the true Liénard-Wiechert potentials, applying it to an incorrect starting potential $V$ makes the whole option wrong.\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\n\nBased on a step-by-step derivation from the fundamental principles of electromagnetism, the expressions in option B are the correct representation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. An analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the final choices are varied, the majority of the agents who perform a full derivation arrive at the formulas presented in option B, even if they subsequently select the wrong letter. The agents who choose B show sound reasoning from start to finish.\n\n<<<B>>>"

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them based on the provided definitions.\n\n### 1. Definitions and Setup\n\n*   **q**: The point charge.\n*   **$\\vec{s}(t)$**: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n*   **$\\vec{r}$**: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   **t**: The time of observation.\n*   **$t_r$**: The retarded time, which is the time the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach the observer at time t. The signal travels at the speed of light, c.\n*   **$\\vec{d}$**: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time, $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n*   The relationship between t and $t_r$ is given by the time it takes for light to travel the distance d:\n    *   $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n*   **$\\vec{v}$**: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}\\bigg|_{t'=t_r}$\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general formulas for the retarded potentials are given by integrals over the source distributions (charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$):\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\nFor a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Scalar Potential V\n\nSubstituting the charge density into the formula for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThis integral is tricky because the retarded time $t_r'$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard method to evaluate this is to introduce another delta function for time and integrate over both space and time.\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\iint \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c)) d^3r' dt'$\n\nFirst, we integrate over the spatial coordinates $d^3r'$. The Dirac delta function $\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$ collapses the integral:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|/c)) dt'$\n\nNow we have an integral over time $t'$. We use the property of the Dirac delta function: $\\int f(x) \\delta(g(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$, where $g(x_i)=0$.\nHere, $f(t') = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}$ and $g(t') = t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c}$.\nThe root of $g(t')=0$ is the retarded time $t_r$.\nWe need to compute the derivative $g'(t')$:\n$g'(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'} \\left( t' - t + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|}{c} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\nThe derivative of the magnitude is:\n$\\frac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| = \\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (-\\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'})}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} = -\\frac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} = -\\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')$\nwhere $\\hat{d}(t')$ is the unit vector from the charge to the observer.\n\nSo, $g'(t') = 1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{c}$.\nEvaluating at the retarded time $t_r$, and using the notation from the problem statement:\n$g'(t_r) = 1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{f(t_r)}{|g'(t_r)|} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1/|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{|(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/dc|} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1/d}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/dc}$\n(Assuming $dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$, which is true for charges moving at speeds less than c).\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{c}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 4. Derivation of the Vector Potential A\n\nThe derivation for $\\vec{A}$ is analogous. The integrand just has an extra factor of $\\vec{v}(t')$.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{v}(t')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|/c)) dt'$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r)/|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{|g'(t_r)|} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{v}/d}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/dc}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\frac{c\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 5.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the fields observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$. This is the time at which a signal, traveling at the speed of light $c$, would have to be emitted from the charge's position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Retarded Time:** The time delay is the light travel time: $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\n2.  **Notation:** Let's use the notation from the problem description:\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the field point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** To match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator:\n    *   $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n    *   Substituting this back into the potential equations:\n        *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n        *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   Option A: Incorrect.

We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, the scalar potential `V` and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$, at a specific point in space $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n\n2.  **Concept of Retarded Potentials:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$. The information (the field) had to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\n3.  **Define Key Quantities:**\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The field point (observation point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time $t_r$. This is the source point.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\n4.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the signal to travel the distance `d` is $d/c$. This leads to the fundamental equation for the retarded time:\n    $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n    This is an implicit equation for $t_r$, as $t_r$ appears on both sides.\n\n5.  **General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:** The general solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials in the Lorenz gauge are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $\\rho$ is the charge density and $\\vec{J}$ is the current density, and $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n6.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` at position $\\vec{s}(t)$, the densities are:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Integrals (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):** Substituting these densities into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals is a non-trivial task because the retarded time $t_r'$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard result of this evaluation gives the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n    The key result of the integration is that the effective charge seen by the observer is modified by a Doppler-like factor. The denominator of the static potential, $4\\pi\\epsilon_0 d$, gets modified.\n\n    The resulting potentials are:\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n        where $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observer. The subscript $t_r$ means all quantities inside the bracket (d, $\\hat{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n8.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** Let's rewrite the denominator to match the options provided:\n    $d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the potential expressions:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Retardation is Key:** The potentials are not determined by the charge's current position and velocity, but by its position and velocity at the retarded time $t_r$. Options A and C use the static form for V, which is incorrect.\n*   **The Denominator Factor:** The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is crucial. It is not simply `dc`. This term accounts for the relativistic effect of the charge's motion on the potential. If the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential becomes larger. This is analogous to the Doppler effect for sound or light waves.\n*   **Sign Convention:** The sign in the denominator is negative: $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. A positive sign, as in option D, is incorrect and would describe an unphysical situation.\n*   **Relationship between V and A:** Notice that $\\vec{A} = (\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v}) V$. Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, this simplifies to $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This is a fundamental relationship for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived expressions with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect V and A.\n*   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   C) Incorrect V.\n*   D) Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The derivation of these potentials is a standard topic in electromagnetism.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\nThe electric and magnetic fields at an observation point `r` at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge `q` at an earlier time, called the retarded time `tr`. This is because electromagnetic disturbances propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined implicitly by the relation:\n`t = tr + d/c`\nwhere `d` is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time, `s(tr)`, to the observation point `r`.\n`d = |r - s(tr)|`\n\nThe potentials `V(r, t)` and `A(r, t)` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t_ret) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_ret) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\nwhere `t_ret = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)` and velocity `v(t) = ds/dt`, the charge and current densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Scalar Potential (V)\nSubstituting the charge density into the formula for `V`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q δ³(r' - s(t - |r - r'|/c)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThis integral is non-trivial because the retarded time depends on the integration variable `r'`. A standard method to solve this is to change the integration variable or, more formally, to evaluate the integral by first integrating over space and then time.\n\nLet's consider the integral in a slightly different form:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫∫ [ρ(r', t') / |r - r'|] δ(t' - (t - |r - r'|/c)) dt' d³r'`\nSubstitute `ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`:\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) ∫∫ [δ³(r' - s(t')) / |r - r'|] δ(t' - (t - |r - r'|/c)) dt' d³r'`\n\nFirst, perform the spatial integral over `d³r'`:\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) ∫ [1 / |r - s(t')|] δ(t' - (t - |r - s(t')|/c)) dt'`\n\nThis integral is of the form `∫ f(t') δ(g(t')) dt'`. The result is `f(tr) / |g'(tr)|`, where `tr` is the time at which `g(tr) = 0`.\nHere, `f(t') = 1 / |r - s(t')|` and `g(t') = t' - t + |r - s(t')|/c`.\nThe condition `g(tr) = 0` gives `tr - t + |r - s(tr)|/c = 0`, which is the definition of the retarded time `tr`.\n\nNow we need to compute the derivative `g'(t')`:\n`g'(t') = d/dt' [t' - t + (1/c) |r - s(t')|] = 1 + (1/c) * d/dt'|r - s(t')|`\nLet `d(t') = r - s(t')`. The magnitude is `d(t') = |d(t')|`.\n`d/dt' d(t') = d/dt' sqrt(d(t') ⋅ d(t')) = (1 / (2d(t'))) * 2d(t') ⋅ (d/dt' d(t'))`\n`d/dt' d(t') = d/dt' (r - s(t')) = -s'(t') = -v(t')`\nSo, `d/dt' d(t') = (d(t') ⋅ (-v(t'))) / d(t') = - (d(t') ⋅ v(t')) / d(t')`\n\nEvaluating at `t' = tr`, and using the notation from the problem statement (`d = r - s(tr)`, `d = |d|`, `v = v(tr)`):\n`g'(tr) = 1 + (1/c) * [ - (d ⋅ v) / d ] = 1 - (d ⋅ v) / (cd) = (cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)`\n\nThe term `cd - d ⋅ v` is always positive for a charge moving at less than the speed of light (`v < c`), so we can drop the absolute value.\n`|g'(tr)| = (cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)`\n\nNow, we can find the potential:\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * f(tr) / g'(tr)`\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * [1 / |r - s(tr)|] / [(cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)]`\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * (1/d) * [cd / (cd - d ⋅ v)]`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Vector Potential (A)\nThe derivation for `A` is analogous.\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_ret) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) ∫ [v(t') / |r - s(t')|] δ(t' - (t - |r - s(t')|/c)) dt'`\n\nThe integral is evaluated in the same way. The function `f(t')` is now `v(t') / |r - s(t')|`.\n`f(tr) = v(tr) / |r - s(tr)| = v / d`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) * f(tr) / g'(tr)`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) * (v/d) / [(cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) * (v/d) * [cd / (cd - d ⋅ v)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ qcv) / (4π (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n*   `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qcv) / (4π (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\nThese expressions match option D exactly.\n\n*   **Option A** has a `+` sign in the denominator, which corresponds to advanced potentials (physically non-causal).\n*   **Options B and C** use the simple static potential form `q / (4πε₀ r)`, which is incorrect as it ignores the retardation effect on the distance and the motion of the charge. The distance should be `d = |r - s(tr)|`, not `r = |r|`, and the denominator needs the corrective factor `(1 - n̂ ⋅ v/c)`.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

The standard denominator is often written as $[R - \\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c]$, where R is the distance from the retarded position. In the user's notation, this becomes $[d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c]$. Factoring out $1/c$ from this expression gives $\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, which, when substituted back into the potential formulas, yields the expressions in option A.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n*   Options B and D use the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the effects of the charge's motion and the retardation of the fields.\n*   Option C has a positive sign in the denominator, which would correspond to an \"advanced\" potential, a non-physical solution that would violate causality.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` depends on the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\nAll the quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. The term `d` is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$.\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can manipulate the denominator:\n$d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThis matches the scalar potential in option C.\n\nNow, let's examine the vector potential, $\\vec{A}$. A key relationship between the Liénard-Wiechert potentials is $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's verify this with the expression for V we just found and the known relationship $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n\n$\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}c}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c^2 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nUsing $\\mu_o = 1/(\\epsilon_o c^2)$, which means $\\mu_o c = 1/(\\epsilon_o c)$, we can substitute this into the expression:\n$\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o c q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThis expression for the vector potential matches the one provided in option C.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n    The general solutions for the scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ in electrodynamics, under the Lorenz gauge condition, are given by the retarded potential formulas. These formulas account for the finite speed of light, `c`, meaning the fields at a point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ depend on the state of the sources at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n    Here, $\\rho$ is the charge density, $\\vec{J}$ is the current density, $\\vec{r}'$ is the position vector of a point within the source distribution, and $t_r$ is the retarded time, defined by the relation:\n    $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n    This equation signifies that the signal (field) emitted from $\\vec{r}'$ at time $t_r$ travels a distance $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|$ and arrives at the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the present time $t$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n    The key difficulty in evaluating these integrals is that the retarded time $t_r$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often shown in advanced E&M textbooks) involves a change of variables and accounts for the \"compression\" of the apparent volume of the source due to its motion.\n\n    The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator. Let's define the quantities as given in the problem:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$: Velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\n    The retarded time condition becomes $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n    The result of the integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} = \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n    The term $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})$ accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. If the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator decreases, leading to a stronger potential, and vice-versa.\n\n4.  **Final Expressions for V and A**\n    Substituting this result back into the integral expressions for V and A:\n\n    For the scalar potential V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right)$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    For the vector potential A:\n    The velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is constant with respect to the spatial integration over $\\vec{r}'$, so it can be taken out of the integral.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right)$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparison with Options**\n    Let's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This is incorrect. V is the static potential, which doesn't account for retardation. The expression for A is dimensionally wrong.\n\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This has the wrong sign in the denominator, which is physically incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        Again, V is the incorrect static potential. Although the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since $\\vec{A}/V = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} = \\vec{v}/c^2$), the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge.

This means the potentials at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$.\n*   The retarded time $t_r$ is defined implicitly by the condition that the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is exactly the difference between the observation time `t` and the emission time $t_r$.\n    *   Position of the charge at retarded time: $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   Vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   Distance between these points: $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   The time delay is $d/c$.\n    *   Therefore, the retarded time condition is: $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$.\n\n### 2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and are given in terms of the charge's properties at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nThe scalar potential $V(\\vec{r}, t)$ is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t)$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$ is the permeability of free space.\n*   The term $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, including the Doppler effect.\n\n### 3. Matching with the Options\n\nNow, let's manipulate the standard formulas to see which option they match. We can rewrite the denominator by finding a common denominator:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstitute this back into the expressions for V and A:\n\n**For the scalar potential V:**\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**For the vector potential A:**\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions exactly match the ones given in option B.\n\n### 4. Verifying the Relationship between V and A\n\nIt is a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\n\nLet's check if this holds for our derived expressions (and for option B).\nStarting with the expression for V from option B:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nMultiply by $\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}$:\n$\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression for $\\vec{A}$ from option B using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, which implies $\\mu_o = 1/(\\epsilon_o c^2)$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o c^2}\\right) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe expressions are identical, confirming the relationship and the correctness of option B.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because it uses the static potential form and ignores the retardation effect in the denominator.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect because it has the wrong sign in the denominator. The negative sign is crucial and arises from the derivative of the retarded time.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect both in its form for V and in the relationship between A and V.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are fundamental results in classical electrodynamics known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **The Principle of Retardation:** Electromagnetic interactions propagate at the finite speed of light, $c$. Consequently, the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the **retarded time**. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer.\n\n2.  **Defining the Variables (as per the problem statement):**\n    *   $q$: The charge.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The retarded time condition is: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potential Formulas:** The derivation from the general retarded potential integrals is a standard textbook exercise. The resulting potentials are:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{\\text{retarded}}$\n\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{\\text{retarded}}$\n\n    The subscript \"retarded\" emphasizes that all quantities in the brackets ($d$, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The term in the denominator, $(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)$, accounts for the relativistic compression of the field due to the charge's motion.\n\n4.  **Matching the Formula to the Options:** The given options have a slightly different algebraic form. We can obtain this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the standard expressions by $c$:\n\n    *   **For the Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   **For the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparison with the Given Options:**\n    *   Options A and B are incorrect. They represent non-relativistic or quasi-static approximations and fail to include the crucial denominator term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ that accounts for retardation effects.\n    *   Option D is incorrect because it has a plus sign ($+$) in the denominator. The correct sign is minus ($-$), which is a direct consequence of the physics of retardation. A plus sign would correspond to an unphysical \"advanced potential\" that violates causality.\n    *   Option C exactly matches the expressions we derived:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the fundamental principles of electromagnetism.\n\n### 1. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ due to a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must be emitted from the source point $\\vec{r}'$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n### 2. Charge and Current Density of a Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge at time $t'$.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Scalar Potential (V)\n\nSubstitute the charge density into the formula for V:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe delta function is non-zero only when $\\vec{r}' = \\vec{s}(t_r)$. However, the retarded time $t_r$ itself depends on $\\vec{r}'$: $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$. This makes the integral non-trivial.\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the property of the Dirac delta function with a functional argument: $\\int f(x) \\delta(g(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$, where $x_i$ are the roots of $g(x)=0$. In 3D, this becomes:\n\n$\\int f(\\vec{r}') \\delta^3(\\vec{g}(\\vec{r}')) d^3r' = \\frac{f(\\vec{r}'_0)}{|\\det(\\nabla \\vec{g})|}$, where $\\vec{g}(\\vec{r}'_0) = 0$.\n\nIn our case, $\\vec{g}(\\vec{r}') = \\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r) = \\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c)$. The integral picks out the value at the unique source position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ where the argument of the delta function is zero. Let's use the notation from the problem statement:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the source to the observer.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nThe retarded time condition is $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\nThe effect of the moving source is to change the effective volume element. The Jacobian of the transformation from $\\vec{r}'$ to $\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is needed. A standard derivation (e.g., in Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\", Section 10.3.2) shows that this introduces a correction factor in the denominator:\n\n$\\int \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r)) d^3r' = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\nApplying this to the integral for V:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)\n\nThe calculation for the vector potential is analogous. We substitute the current density into the formula for $\\vec{A}$:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe velocity $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is evaluated at the retarded time, so it is treated as a constant during the spatial integration over $\\vec{r}'$. The integral is the same as before, but with an extra factor of $q\\vec{v}(t_r)$ in the numerator instead of just $q$.\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nThe derived expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions exactly match option A.\n\nLet's briefly check the other options:\n*   B) and D) use the static potential form $V = q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_o r)$, which is incorrect as it neglects the retardation effect in the denominator and uses the instantaneous distance $r$ instead of the retarded distance $d$.\n*   C) has an incorrect sign ($+$ instead of $-$) in the denominator. The minus sign is crucial; it shows that the potential is enhanced when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\nTherefore, option A correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time `t` depend on the state of the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is implicitly defined by the relation $t = t_r + d/c$, where `d` is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$ from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nThe correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by:\n\nScalar Potential:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nVector Potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (the charge's position, velocity, and the distance vector) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\nBy factoring out `c` from the denominator, the expressions can be rewritten as:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThese expressions match option B. It is important to note that for a moving charge, a scalar potential alone is not sufficient to describe the electric field; a vector potential is also required.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the finite speed of light, meaning the field observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* was generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*.\n\nThe retarded time *tr* is defined implicitly by the relation $t - t_r = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$, which states that the time difference is equal to the time it took for the electromagnetic signal to travel from the charge's position at *tr* to the observation point.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, the terms in the square brackets are evaluated at the retarded time *tr*. The notation is as follows:\n*   $\\vec{R}$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, which corresponds to $\\vec{d}$ in the problem statement.\n*   $R$ is the magnitude of $\\vec{R}$, corresponding to $d$.\n*   $\\hat{n}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{R}$, so $\\hat{n} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n*   $\\vec{\\beta}$ is the velocity of the charge normalized by the speed of light, $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n\nSubstituting the problem's notation into the denominator term $R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n$d(1 - (\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c)) = d(1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}) = d(\\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}) = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the potentials using this result:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option A. It is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which holds true for the expressions in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the finite speed of light, which means the fields observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* were generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time is determined by the condition that the time difference $t - t_r$ is equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$, which is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. This can be written as:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe derivation of the potentials involves integrating the retarded charge and current densities. A key factor that emerges from this derivation is a term in the denominator that accounts for the motion of the source during the emission of the signal.\n\nThe scalar potential V is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\nwhere $\\vec{n} = \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d}$ is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n\nSubstituting $\\vec{n}$ and simplifying the denominator gives:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSo, the scalar potential becomes:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese two potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Comparing these derived expressions with the given options, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nLet's define the terms according to the problem statement:\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: the trajectory of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: the time of observation.\n*   `tr`: the retarded time, which is the time at which the field observed at `(r, t)` was emitted by the charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(tr)$: the position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=tr}$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$: the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |\\vec{d}|`: the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `c`: the speed of light in vacuum.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$: the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$: the permeability of free space.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the observation time `t` and the retarded time `tr` is that the time difference must be equal to the time it takes for light to travel the distance `d`:\n$t - tr = \\frac{d}{c}$  or  $t = tr + \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from the general retarded potential formulas for continuous charge and current distributions:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d\\tau'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge, the charge and current densities are given by Dirac delta functions:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas and performing the integration (which is non-trivial due to the time dependence in the delta function's argument) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The standard result of this derivation is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThe term $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, including the Doppler effect. The vector $\\vec{d}$ points from the source to the observer. If the charge is moving towards the observer, $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$, the denominator decreases, and the potential is larger. If the charge moves away, $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} < 0$, the denominator increases, and the potential is smaller. This confirms the negative sign.\n\nNow, let's manipulate these expressions to match the format of the given options.

This uses the static potential form, ignoring retardation, and the formula for A is dimensionally wrong.\n\nB) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\nIncorrect. This uses the static potential form, which is only valid for a stationary charge or at very low velocities.\n\nC) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\nIncorrect. The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of `-`. The definition of $\\vec{d}$ is standard (from source to observer), so the sign should be negative.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n*   A charge `q` is moving along a path `s(t)`.\n*   We want to find the potentials at a specific point `r` and time `t`.\n*   Electromagnetic fields travel at the speed of light `c`. This means the field we observe at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the retarded time `tr`.\n*   The signal travels a distance `d = |r - s(tr)|` in the time interval `t - tr`. Therefore, `t - tr = d / c`.\n*   The vector `d` is defined as `r - s(tr)`, pointing from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is `v = v(tr)`.\n\n**2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\nThe potentials for a moving point charge are derived from Maxwell's equations and are given by:\nScalar Potential (V):\n$$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$$\nVector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):\n$$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$$\nwhere all quantities on the right side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n**3. Matching with the Options**\nLet's rearrange the denominator to match the format given in the options:\n$$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$$\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`:\nFor `V`:\n$$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$$\nFor `A`:\n$$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$$\n\n**4. Comparing with the Choices**\n*   A) `V` and `A` have `(dc + d·v)` in the denominator. Incorrect sign.\n*   B) `V` and `A` have `(dc - d·v)` in the denominator. This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n*   C) The expression for `V` is the static potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge.

We want to find the potentials at a specific field point $\\vec{r}$ at a specific time `t` (the observer).\n2.  **Retardation:** Electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. The field observed at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was not generated by the charge at its present position $\\vec{s}(t)$, but by the charge at some earlier position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ at an earlier time $t_r$. This earlier time is called the **retarded time**.\n3.  **Causality Condition:** The time delay $(t - t_r)$ is exactly the time it takes for light to travel the distance from the source's position at $t_r$ to the observer's position $\\vec{r}$. This distance is given by the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    Therefore, the fundamental relationship defining the retarded time $t_r$ is:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$\n    where $d = |\\vec{d}|$. This is an implicit equation for $t_r$.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nThe scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ for a general time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Formulas to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge `q` with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas leads to the well-known **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. The derivation involves a careful evaluation of the integral with the delta function, where the retarded time itself depends on the integration variable. The standard result of this derivation is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, all quantities inside the brackets on the right-hand side ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Expressions and Compare with Options\n\nLet's manipulate the derived formulas to match the format of the given options.\n1.  **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    Multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n2.  **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    Multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Careful Points and Options\n\n*   **The Sign in the Denominator:** The term `(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})` is crucial. The negative sign is correct. It accounts for the \"bunching up\" of the field lines when the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$, denominator gets smaller, potential gets stronger) and the \"spreading out\" when it moves away ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} < 0$, denominator gets larger, potential gets weaker). A positive sign would describe an unphysical advanced potential.\n*   **Relationship between V and $\\vec{A}$:** Notice that $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}{1} \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r},t)$. Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, this means $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is a fundamental relationship for Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A)** Has `+` in the denominator. This is incorrect. It would correspond to advanced potentials.\n    *   **B)** Uses the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect as it neglects retardation. The relationship between A and V is also dimensionally wrong.\n    *   **C)** Uses the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is formally correct for the true potentials, the expression for V itself is wrong.\n    *   **D)** The expressions for both V and $\\vec{A}$ match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly. They have the correct form, the correct `c` factors, and the crucial negative sign in the denominator.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) are given in option D.\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions correctly account for the finite speed of light and the motion of the source charge.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The solution involves applying the general formulas for retarded potentials to the specific case of a point charge.\n\n### 1. Definitions and Setup\n\nLet's define the key quantities based on the problem description:\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q`.\n*   **Trajectory:** The position of the charge at any time `t'` is given by the vector function $\\vec{s}(t')$.\n*   **Velocity:** The velocity of the charge at time `t'` is $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$.\n*   **Observation Point:** The potentials are measured at position $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The field observed at `(r, t)` was emitted by the charge at an earlier time, `t_r`. This \"retarded time\" is determined by the condition that the time difference `t - t_r` must be equal to the time it takes light to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r`.\n    *   Position of the charge at the retarded time: $\\vec{s}_r = \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   Vector from the retarded position to the observation point: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}_r$.\n    *   Distance from the retarded position to the observation point: $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}_r|$.\n    *   The retardation condition is: $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials for a time-varying charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge and current densities are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\vec{v}(t') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 3. Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nSubstituting the delta-function densities into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the argument of $\\rho$ and $\\vec{J}$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation (often shown in advanced E&M textbooks) leads to the following result.\n\nThe effect of the motion of the charge is to modify the effective distance in the denominator. The standard Coulomb potential $q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 d)$ is modified by a factor related to the Doppler effect. The result of the integration is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nwhere $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nNow, we can manipulate the expressions to match the format given in the options. Let's focus on the denominator:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expressions for V and A:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential A:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option A.\n\n*   **Option A:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   This is a perfect match with our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n*   **Option B:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   The scalar potential is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect as it neglects retardation and the motion effect in the denominator. The relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, but the formula for V itself is wrong.\n\n*   **Option C:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   Incorrect scalar potential and incorrect (and dimensionally flawed) relation between $\\vec{A}$ and V.\n\n*   **Option D:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   The sign in the denominator is incorrect. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like compression or stretching of the \"space\" from which the field emanates.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly states the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived directly from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe core of the derivation involves evaluating the potentials at the observation point `r` and time `t` by considering the state of the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. The retarded time is defined such that a light signal emitted from the charge at `tr` from position `s(tr)` reaches the observer at `r` at time `t`. This is expressed by the relation `t - tr = d/c`, where `d = |r - s(tr)|` is the distance the signal travels.\n\nThe derivation results in the following expressions for the scalar and vector potentials:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    The scalar potential is given by the formula:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    where the quantities in the bracket are all evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. By multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`, we can rewrite this as:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This expression matches the scalar potential given in option C.\n\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    Similarly, the vector potential is found to be:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    Again, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` yields:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This expression matches the vector potential in option C.\n\nFurthermore, it can be shown that the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by the expression $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's verify this for the given expressions in option C:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\cdot \\dfrac{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}{qc} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}$\nUsing the fundamental relation $c^2 = \\dfrac{1}{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}$, we get:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\vec{v} \\implies \\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\nThis confirms the internal consistency of the expressions in option C.\n\nOptions A and B incorrectly use the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the effects of retardation. Option D has an incorrect sign in the denominator. Therefore, option C provides the correct expressions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the finite speed of light, meaning the field observed at a point and time (t) was generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time (tr).\n\nThe correct formulas are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}$\n\nRearranging the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option B. The term in the denominator, $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, is a crucial modification to the static potentials and arises from the relativistic effects of the moving charge. Specifically, it accounts for the change in the apparent volume of the charge distribution due to its motion relative to the observer.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because it uses a plus sign in the denominator. This would correspond to the \"advanced\" potentials, which describe a field that exists before it was generated, a solution that is typically dismissed on grounds of causality.\n*   **Options C and D** are incorrect because they start with the formula for the static potential, $V = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$, which is only valid for a stationary charge. The potential for a moving charge must account for the effects of its velocity, which significantly alters the expression.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the finite speed of light, meaning the fields observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ were generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V or $\\phi$):**\n    $\\phi(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, the quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. Let's translate the standard notation to the notation given in the problem:\n*   $R$ is the magnitude of the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, which is $d$.\n*   $\\hat{n}$ is the unit vector in that direction, so $\\hat{n} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n*   $\\vec{\\beta}$ is the velocity normalized by the speed of light, $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n\nSubstituting these into the standard formulas:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - (\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c))} = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - (\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot (\\vec{v}/c))} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nComparing these derived expressions with the given options, we find that they match option A. Option C has an incorrect sign in the denominator. Options B and D use the static Coulomb potential form, which is not correct for a moving charge causing time-varying fields.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\nThe electromagnetic fields (and potentials) at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ are not determined by the state of the source charge at time $t$, but by its state at an earlier time, called the **retarded time** ($t_r$). This is because electromagnetic disturbances propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light $c$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the condition that the time it takes for light to travel from the source's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is exactly $t - t_r$.\nLet the trajectory of the charge $q$ be $\\vec{s}(t)$. The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe distance is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\nThe retardation condition is therefore:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} \\bigg|_{t=t_r}$.\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Potentials (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials)\n\nThe general expressions for the potentials in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ and $d\\tau'$ is the volume element at the source point $\\vec{r}'$.\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\vec{v}(t') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation of the integral, which accounts for the \"compression\" of the apparent volume of the source due to its motion (a relativistic Doppler-like effect), yields the following results.\n\n### 3. Scalar Potential (V)\nThe integral for the scalar potential evaluates to:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nwhere $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$, and the subscript \"ret\" indicates that all quantities inside the bracket ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c}) = d - \\frac{d(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}/d)}{c} = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}$\nSo, the potential can be written as:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\nTo match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{c}{c} \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)\nSimilarly, the integral for the vector potential evaluates to:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nUsing the same denominator simplification as before:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Comparing with Options\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential form, which is not valid for a moving charge (unless $v=0$). The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally and conceptually incorrect.\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A plus sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which are generally considered unphysical.\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. Again, this uses the static form for $V$. While the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$ is actually correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials (as shown by comparing the expressions in option B), the expression for $V$ itself is wrong, making the entire option incorrect as an answer to the question.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   **Observer:** Located at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n*   **Retardation:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ and an earlier time `t_r`. This is the \"retarded time\".\n*   **Key Vectors and Scalars:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: Velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\nThe condition relating the observation time `t` and the retarded time `t_r` is that the time difference must be equal to the light travel time over the distance `d`:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Deriving the Potentials\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge. They are derived from the general retarded potential formulas for continuous charge and current distributions:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nFor a point charge `q`, the charge density is $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$ and the current density is $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n\nPerforming the integration with the Dirac delta function is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard derivation (found in textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") leads to the following result:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n\nHere, the subscript `ret` means all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `\\hat{d}`, `\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`. $\\hat{d}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$, i.e., $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n\n### 3. Matching with the Given Options\n\nLet's rewrite the derived potentials to match the format of the options. The key is the denominator term:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}) = d(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{d}/d)\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for V and A.\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\nTo eliminate the `c` in the denominator of the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and the main denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\nSimilarly, multiply the numerator and main denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n*   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect potential (uses instantaneous distance `r` instead of retarded distance `d`) and is only a quasi-static approximation.\n*   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect potential and incorrect relation for $\\vec{A}$.\n*   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Matches our derived expressions exactly.\n\nThe expressions in option D are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation:\n\n1.  **Retarded Potentials**: The foundation for calculating fields from time-varying sources is the concept of retarded potentials. Since electromagnetic influences travel at the speed of light, $c$, the potential at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ depends on the state of the source at an earlier, or **retarded time**, $t_r$. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it took for the signal to travel from the source to the field point.\n\n2.  **Source Definitions**:\n    *   Let the trajectory of the point charge $q$ be $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The distance this signal traveled is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is therefore $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: Solving the general retarded potential integrals for a moving point charge yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. A key feature of this result is a correction factor in the denominator that accounts for the motion of the source. The standard form of these potentials is:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n4.  **Comparing with the Options**: The given options are written in a slightly different algebraic form. We can rewrite our derived formulas to match the options. Let's focus on the denominator term:\n    \n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    By finding a common denominator, this becomes:\n\n    $\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the expressions for $V$ and $\\vec{A}$:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\left(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\left(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Final Check**:\n    *   These derived expressions match **Option A** perfectly.\n    *   Options B and C use the static Coulomb potential form, which is only valid for a stationary charge and ignores the crucial effects of retardation and source motion.\n    *   Option D has a plus sign ($+$) in the denominator instead of a minus sign ($-$). This corresponds to the non-physical \"advanced potentials,\" whereas the physical solution is the \"retarded potential.\"\n\nTherefore, Option A correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive these potentials from the fundamental formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Definition of Terms\n\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   `\\vec{r}`: The position vector of the point where the field is being observed (the field point).\n*   `t`: The time at which the field is observed.\n*   `t_r`: The retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at position `\\vec{r}` at time `t`.\n*   The signal travels at the speed of light `c`. The distance the signal travels is `|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`. The time taken is `t - t_r`. Therefore, the retarded time `t_r` is defined implicitly by the equation:\n    `c(t - t_r) = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`\n*   `\\vec{d}`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `t_r` to the observation point `\\vec{r}`.\n    `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)`\n*   `d`: The magnitude of the vector `\\vec{d}`.\n    `d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`\n    From the definition of retarded time, we have `d = c(t - t_r)`.\n*   `\\vec{v}`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `t_r`.\n    `\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}\\bigg|_{t'=t_r}`\n*   `\\epsilon_0`: Permittivity of free space.\n*   `\\mu_0`: Permeability of free space.\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials for a time-varying charge distribution `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')` and current distribution `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')` are the retarded potentials:\n\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'`\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'`\n\nwhere `t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n### 3. Potentials for a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `\\vec{s}(t)`, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n\n`\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n`\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))` where `\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'`.\n\nSubstituting these into the retarded potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `t_r` in the argument of `\\rho` and `\\vec{J}` depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`. A careful evaluation of the integral (often done by introducing another delta function for time and integrating over `t'` first) yields the following result:\n\nThe effective charge is modified by a kinematic factor that accounts for the fact that the volume element of the source is \"seen\" differently by the observer due to the source's motion (a Doppler-like effect). The denominator `|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|` is replaced by `[|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}')}{c|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|})]_{t_r}`.\n\nUsing the notation defined in Step 1:\n`[|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|]_{t_r} = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| = d`\n`[\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}']_{t_r} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r) = \\vec{d}`\n`[\\vec{v}]_{t_r} = \\vec{v}(t_r) = \\vec{v}`\n\nThe evaluation of the integral for the scalar potential gives:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{d}/(cd))}`\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}`\n\nTo match the format in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}`\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential, the integral yields:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{d}/(cd))}`\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}`\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}`\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`**\n    This exactly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n*   **B) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`**\n    The expression for `V` is the electrostatic potential, which ignores all retardation and motion effects. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`**\n    Similar to B, this uses the incorrect static potential for `V`. Although the relation `\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V` is correct for the true Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since `\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2`), the expressions given for `V` and `A` are wrong.\n\n*   **D) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`**\n    This option has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-` sign. The negative sign is crucial as it describes the Doppler effect: when the charge moves towards the observer (`\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v} > 0`), the denominator decreases, and the potential increases. The `+` sign would incorrectly describe the opposite effect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct representation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. The retarded time is defined by the condition that the time elapsed (`t - tr`) equals the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point, i.e., $t - t_r = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| / c = d/c$.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by the following expressions:\n\nThe scalar potential V is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\nAnd the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\nIn these expressions, all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. The terms can be rearranged by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nComparing these correct formulas with the given options, we find that option B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe potentials are calculated at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, but they depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$. The retarded time is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The signal travels at the speed of light, $c$.\n\nLet the trajectory of the charge be $\\vec{s}(t)$. The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\nThe relationship between the observation time and the retarded time is given by $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nThe velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and are given by:\n\nScalar Potential:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nVector Potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThe presence of the term $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source. Specifically, it accounts for the fact that the volume of the charge distribution appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to the charge's motion.\n\nIt is also a known property that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ for a moving point charge by the following relation:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\nUsing the relationship $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$, we can verify this from the expressions above:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\n\nNow, let's compare these correct expressions with the given options:\nA) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: This expression is for a quasi-static case and does not correctly account for the retardation effect in the denominator.\nB) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: This has an incorrect positive sign in the denominator.\nC) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: This is incorrect for multiple reasons, including the use of `r` instead of the retarded distance and an incorrect form for the vector potential.\nD) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: These expressions match the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct formulas for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe key principle is that electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light, *c*. Therefore, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* are determined by the state of the charge *q* at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*. The retarded time is when the electromagnetic signal was generated, such that it arrives at $\\vec{r}$ exactly at time *t*. This condition is expressed as $t - tr = d/c$, where *d* is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$ from the charge's position at the retarded time, $\\vec{s}(tr)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials from Maxwell's equations yields the following expressions:\n\nThe scalar potential is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAnd the vector potential is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nHere, all quantities related to the charge (its position, which determines $\\vec{d}$, and its velocity $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time *tr*.\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can manipulate the denominator:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese results match the expressions provided in option D. It is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential can be related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$, which is satisfied by the expressions in option D when using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o\\mu_o)$.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ and $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential $V$ and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nLet's start with the general formulas for retarded potentials for a localized charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$ is the retarded time.\n\nFor a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is not straightforward because the retarded time $t_r$ in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard procedure to evaluate these integrals leads to the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe procedure involves a change of variables and careful evaluation using the properties of the delta function. The result of this derivation is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, the notation \"[]$_{t_r}$\" means that all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. Let's translate this into the notation given in the problem:\n- The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n- The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n- The vector from the source at $t_r$ to the observer at $\\vec{r}$ is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n- The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n- The unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$ is $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n- The retarded time $t_r$ is implicitly defined by the relation $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nNow let's rewrite the potential expressions using this notation. The factor in the denominator is:\n$d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\nSubstituting this into the expressions for V and A:\n\nScalar Potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nVector Potential A:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese derived expressions match exactly with option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\nA) These are potentials in the quasi-static approximation, ignoring the full retardation effect in the denominator. This is incorrect.\nB) This option has a plus sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$). This would correspond to advanced potentials, which violate causality (effect precedes cause). The physically correct solution uses retarded potentials, which have a minus sign.\nC) The expression for V is incorrect (quasi-static), and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is dimensionally incorrect and structurally wrong ($\\vec{v}^2$ is a scalar).\n\nTherefore, option D correctly represents the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. It's also useful to note that for these potentials, the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$ holds, because $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key to solving this is understanding the concept of \"retarded time\". Because electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light `c`, the fields observed at a point `r` at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time `tr`, called the retarded time.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define Retarded Time (tr):** The retarded time `tr` is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position `s(tr)` to reach the observation point `r` at the current time `t`. The relationship is given by:\n    `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n2.  **Define Key Vectors:**\n    *   `s(tr)`: Position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `v = ds/dt |_(t=tr)`: Velocity of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   `d = |d|`: The magnitude of this vector, which is the distance the signal traveled. So, `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n3.  **Retarded Potentials:** The general formulas for the potentials from time-varying charge and current distributions are:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\n4.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge, the charge and current densities are `ρ(r', tr) = q * δ(r' - s(tr))` and `J(r', tr) = q * v(tr) * δ(r' - s(tr))`. Performing the integration over the delta functions is not straightforward because the retarded time `tr` itself depends on `r'`. The result of this integration (which accounts for the relativistic compression of the volume element) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (v ⋅ d) / c)]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (v ⋅ d) / c)]`\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** To match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator:\n    `d - (v ⋅ d) / c = (1/c) * (cd - v ⋅ d)`\n    Substituting this back into the potential equations:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((1/c) * (cd - v ⋅ d))] = qc / (4πε₀ (cd - v ⋅ d))`\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / ((1/c) * (cd - v ⋅ d))] = (μ₀qc * v) / (4π (cd - v ⋅ d))`\n\n6.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   A) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d.v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc + d.v))` - The sign in the denominator is `+`, which is incorrect.\n    *   B) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d.v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d.v))` - This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   C) & D) These options use the static potential `V = q / (4πε₀ r)`, which is incorrect for a moving charge whose fields are observed at a distance.

We need to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n\nThe most important concept here is the **retarded time**. Because electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light `c`, the fields observed at `(r, t)` are not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time, `tr`, called the retarded time. The time difference `t - tr` is exactly the time it took for the signal (the field) to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\n### Step 2: Defining Variables and the Retarded Time Condition\n\nLet's formally define the variables based on the problem description:\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n*   `r`: The position vector of the field observation point.\n*   `t`: The time of observation.\n*   `tr`: The retarded time (the time the signal was emitted).\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `v = ds/dt |_(t=tr)`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`: The distance the signal traveled.\n*   `c`: The speed of light in vacuum.\n*   `ε₀`: The permittivity of free space.\n*   `μ₀`: The permeability of free space.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined by the implicit equation:\n`t - tr = d / c`\nThis equation states that the time interval equals the light-travel time over the distance `d`.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe general formulas for the retarded potentials for continuous charge and current densities (`ρ` and `J`) are:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge, we have `ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))` and `J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas and performing the integration (which is non-trivial due to the `r'` dependence in `tr`) yields the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The result of the integration.** A standard derivation in electromagnetism textbooks (like Griffiths, Chapter 10) shows that the time dependence of the source's position within the delta function introduces a correction factor in the denominator.\n\nThe resulting scalar potential is:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) [q / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c))]_ret`\nwhere `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observer, and all quantities (`d`, `d`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\nLet's simplify this expression:\n`d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c) = d - d(d̂ ⋅ v/c) = d - (d ⋅ v)/c`\nSo, `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * qc / (cd - d ⋅ v)`\nThis is the Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The sign in the denominator.** The term `d ⋅ v` represents the component of the charge's velocity along the line of sight to the observer. If the charge is moving towards the observer, this term is positive (as `d = r - s(tr)`, the vector `d` points towards the observer while `v` is shortening that distance), which makes the denominator smaller and the potential stronger (a Doppler-like effect). The minus sign is physically correct.\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential is found to be:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) [q v / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c))]_ret`\n\nSimplifying this expression in the same way:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * q v / (d - d ⋅ v / c)`\nAnd multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qc v / (cd - d ⋅ v)`\nThis is the Liénard-Wiechert vector potential.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Relationship between V and A.**\nNotice that we can write the vector potential `A` in terms of the scalar potential `V`.\nFrom our derived formulas:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (Denominator)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (Denominator)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) / (1 / 4πε₀) * v * V(r, t) = (μ₀ ε₀) v V(r, t)`\nUsing the relation `c² = 1 / (μ₀ ε₀)`, we get:\n`A(r, t) = (v / c²) V(r, t)`\nThis provides a useful consistency check.\n\n### Step 4: Comparing with the Given Options\n\nLet's analyze the options based on our derived potentials.\n\n*   **Our derived expressions:**\n    *   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n    *   `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\n*   **Option A:** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`\n    *   `V` is the simple static potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge. `A` is also incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`\n    *   `V` is incorrect. While the relation between `A` and `V` looks correct, it's applied to the wrong `V`.\n\n*   **Option C:** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n    *   The expression for `V` matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential.\n    *   The expression for `A` matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert vector potential.\n    *   Let's check the consistency: `A = (v/c²)V`.\n        *   `(v/c²)V = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀(dc - d⋅v))] = qv / (4πε₀c(dc - d⋅v))`\n        *   Rewriting `A` from the option using `μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²)`:\n        *   `A = [1/(ε₀c²)] * qcv / (4π(dc - d⋅v)) = qv / (4πε₀c(dc - d⋅v))`\n        *   They are consistent. This option is correct.\n\n*   **Option D:** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n    *   This option has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is physically incorrect as explained in Careful Point 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis confirms that the expressions in option C correctly represent the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential ($V$) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's break down the derivation and reasoning.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Concepts\n\n*   **Source and Field Points:** A point charge $q$ is at position $\\vec{s}(t)$ at time $t$. We want to find the potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, $c$. The effect felt at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ is due to the state of the charge at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the retarded time. The time delay $(t - t_r)$ is the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the field point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   **Vector Definitions:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the field point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the retarded position to the field point.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t)}{dt} \\bigg|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n*   **Retarded Time Equation:** The time delay is given by the distance divided by the speed of light:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$ or $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general formulas for retarded potentials by treating the charge as a delta-function charge distribution and a corresponding current distribution.\n\n*   Scalar Potential ($V$):\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n*   Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nFor a point charge $q$ with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are:\n*   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas is not trivial because the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation of the integral (often done in advanced E&M textbooks like Griffiths or Jackson) yields a correction factor in the denominator. This factor accounts for the fact that the volume of the charge distribution appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)| - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r))}{c}} \\right]$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}(t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)| - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r))}{c}} \\right]$\n\n### 3. Applying the Problem's Notation\n\nNow, let's substitute the notation given in the problem statement into these standard forms:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity at $t_r$.\n\nThe denominator becomes:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})$\n\nSubstituting this into the potential expressions:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})} \\right] = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})} \\right] = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Comparing with Options\n\nLet's compare these derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}}$\n    This matches our derived results exactly.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)}$**\n    This is incorrect. It uses the static potential and has a dimensionally incorrect form for $\\vec{A}$.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}}$\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A plus sign would correspond to \"advanced potentials\" which are generally considered unphysical. The minus sign is correct for the retarded (physical) potentials.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    This is incorrect. It uses the static potential, failing to account for retardation. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for $V$ itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, *c*. Therefore, the field experienced at an observation point **r** at time *t* was generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *t*<sub>r</sub>.\n\nThe correct expressions must depend on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at this retarded time. The scalar and vector potentials are given by the following formulas:\n\nThe scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{|\\vec{d}| - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThe vector potential is related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. Substituting the expression for V and using the relation $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}$, we can write the vector potential as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{d}| - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of these expressions by *c*:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{|\\vec{d}|c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{d}|c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nUsing the problem's notation where $d = |\\vec{d}|$, these expressions become:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese formulas precisely match option B. The denominator term, $(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, is a crucial component that arises from evaluating the effect of the moving source at the retarded time. Options A and C are incorrect because they use the static potential form, which does not account for the charge's motion or retardation effects. Option D is incorrect due to the positive sign in the denominator, which is inconsistent with the Liénard-Wiechert formulation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe key is to evaluate the charge density and current at the \"retarded time\" `tr`. The retarded time is the instant in the past when the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observer at position `$\\vec{r}$` at time `t`. It is defined by the relation: `t - tr = d/c`, where `d` is the magnitude of the vector `$\\vec{d}$`, which points from the charge's position at the retarded time, `$\\vec{s}(tr)$`, to the observation point `$\\vec{r}$`.\n\nThe correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by:\n\nScalar Potential (V):\n`$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$`\n\nVector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):\n`$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$`\n\nThe subscript `$t_r$` indicates that all quantities inside the brackets—`d`, `$\\vec{d}$`, and `$\\vec{v}$`—are evaluated at the retarded time.\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n`$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$`\n\n`$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$`\n\nThese expressions match option D. The term `$(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$` in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, similar to a Doppler effect. The other options are incorrect because they either use the wrong sign in the denominator or use the static potential form, which does not account for retardation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

Let's analyze the provided options based on the standard formulas for Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe scalar potential `V` is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c)}$\nwhere all quantities on the right, such as the separation vector $\\vec{d}$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$, are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\nBy multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`, this expression can be rewritten as:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential `V` by the expression:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n\nSubstituting the expression for `V` and the relation $\\mu_o = 1/(\\epsilon_o c^2)$, we get:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nComparing these derived formulas with the given options:\n*   **A) and B)** are incorrect because they represent the static or non-relativistic potential and do not account for the retardation effects in the denominator.\n*   **C)** correctly presents both the scalar potential `V` and the vector potential `A` derived from the Liénard-Wiechert formulas.\n*   **D)** is incorrect due to the positive sign in the denominator. The Doppler-like factor $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ correctly features a minus sign.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Setup**\n    *   We have a point charge `q` moving along a path described by the vector function `s(t)`.\n    *   We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at a specific observation point `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n    *   Electromagnetic signals (and thus the influence of the charge) travel at the speed of light, `c`. This means the potentials at `(r, t)` are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, called the *retarded time*, `tr`.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is the time at which the signal must have been emitted from the charge's position `s(tr)` to reach the observation point `r` at time `t`. The relationship is given by:\n        `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n2.  **Defining Key Vectors and Quantities**\n    *   **Source position at retarded time:** `s(tr)`.\n    *   **Vector from source to observer:** The problem defines this vector as `d`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   **Distance from source to observer:** The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d|`.\n    *   **Velocity of the charge at retarded time:** `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n    *   The retarded time condition can be rewritten using our notation: `t - tr = d / c`.\n\n3.  **Retarded Potential Integrals**\n    For a general time-varying charge density `rho(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')`, the retarded potentials are given by:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) ∫ [rho(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    where `tr = t - |r - r'|/c` is the retarded time for each source point `r'`.\n\n4.  **Applying to a Point Charge**\n    For a point charge `q` moving along `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    *   `rho(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n    *   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n    Substituting these into the potential integrals is complex because the retarded time `tr` in the argument of the delta function also depends on the integration variable `r'`. A standard, but non-trivial, evaluation of these integrals (found in advanced electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") yields the following results, known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**:\n\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) * [q / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]_ret`\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) * [q * v / (d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c))]_ret`\n\n    The `_ret` subscript signifies that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `d̂`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    Here, `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded source position to the observation point.\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expressions**\n    Let's focus on the denominator term:\n    `d * (1 - (d̂ ⋅ v)/c) = d * (1 - ( (d/d) ⋅ v )/c) = d - (d ⋅ v)/c`\n\n    Now, substitute this simplified denominator back into the potential equations:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) * [q / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c)]`\n\n    To match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πϵo) * [qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n\n    Similarly, for the vector potential `A`:\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (d ⋅ v)/c)]`\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    `A(r, t) = (μo / 4π) * [qc * v / (dc - d ⋅ v)]`\n\n6.  **Comparing with the Given Options**\n\n    Let's examine the options provided:\n    *   A) Incorrect form for V (static potential) and incorrect relation for A.\n    *   B) Same form as our result, but with a `+` sign in the denominator (`dc + d.v`). This is incorrect; the sign is `-`. The sign accounts for the Doppler-like effect; when the charge moves towards the observer (`d.v` > 0), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential stronger.\n    *   C) Incorrect form for V (static potential). While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for `V` itself is wrong.\n    *   D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πεo * (dc - d⋅v))` and `A(r,t) = μo qc v / (4π * (dc - d⋅v))`.\n\n    These expressions exactly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The notation in the option matches the standard derivation perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential (A) of a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's analyze the problem based on the principles of classical electrodynamics.\n\n### 1. Understanding Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the potential measured at a specific point `r` and time `t` is not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time, `t_r`, called the **retarded time**. The time delay `t - t_r` is exactly the time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r`.\n\nLet's define the key vectors and scalars based on the problem description:\n*   `s(t_r)`: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `t_r`.\n*   `r`: The position of the observer (the field point).\n*   `d = r - s(t_r)`: The vector pointing from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d| = |r - s(t_r)|`: The distance between the retarded position and the observation point.\n*   `v = ds/dt |_(t=t_r)`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `t_r`.\n*   `c`: The speed of light.\n\nThe condition for the retarded time `t_r` is given by the relation:\n`t - t_r = d / c`\n\n### 2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential formulas:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are given by:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n\nEvaluating these integrals is a standard but non-trivial procedure in electromagnetism. The result of this evaluation yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The standard forms are:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d(1 - (n · v)/c))]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d(1 - (n · v)/c))]`\n\nwhere `n = d / d` is the unit vector in the direction of `d`.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Expressions\n\nLet's simplify the denominator term in the standard formulas:\n`d(1 - (n · v)/c) = d - d * (n · v)/c = d - (d · v)/c`\n\nSo the potentials can be written as:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d · v)/c)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (d · v)/c)]`\n\n### 4. Comparing with the Given Options\n\nNow, let's examine the expressions provided in the options.\n\n*   **Options A and B:** These suggest `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it does not account for retardation effects.\n*   **Option D:** This option has a `+` sign in the denominator: `(dc + d · v)`. This corresponds to \"advanced potentials\", which would mean the effect precedes the cause. These are generally considered unphysical solutions. The condition `t > t_r` implies we are looking for the retarded (causal) solution.\n*   **Option C:**\n    `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))`\n    `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))`\n\nLet's manipulate the denominator of option C to compare it with our standard form:\n`dc - d · v = c * (d - (d · v)/c)`\n\nNow substitute this back into the expressions from Option C:\n*   For `V(r,t)`:\n    `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ * c(d - (d · v)/c)) = q / (4πε₀ (d - (d · v)/c))`\n    This matches the standard Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential.\n\n*   For `A(r,t)`:\n    `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π * c(d - (d · v)/c)) = (μ₀q v) / (4π (d - (d · v)/c))`\n    This matches the standard Liénard-Wiechert vector potential.\n\n### 5. Final Check\n\nAs a consistency check, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by `A = (v/c²)V`. Let's verify this for Option C.\n`A / V = [μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))] / [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))]`\n`A / V = (μ₀qc v / 4π) * (4πε₀ / qc) = μ₀ε₀v`\nUsing the relation `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, we get `μ₀ε₀ = 1/c²`.\nTherefore, `A / V = v/c²`, which confirms `A = (v/c²)V`.\n\nThe expressions in option C are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials, just written in a slightly different but algebraically equivalent form.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key concept is \"retardation,\" which accounts for the finite time it takes for electromagnetic effects to propagate at the speed of light, $c$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understanding Retardation:** The potential measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is not caused by the charge's properties at time $t$, but by its properties at an earlier **retarded time**, $t_r$. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Defining Variables:** Based on the problem description:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge $q$ at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$ is the observation point.\n    *   $t$ is the observation time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the moment of emission to the point of observation.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance this signal travels.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n    The retarded time $t_r$ is implicitly defined by the light-travel condition:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The standard derivation from the general retarded potential formulas for a point charge gives the following results for the scalar potential $V$ and vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n\n    Note: All quantities in the denominators ($d$, $\\vec{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The negative sign in the denominator is characteristic of the retarded (causal) potential. A positive sign would represent a non-physical \"advanced\" potential.\n\n4.  **Formatting the Expression:** The options in the question are presented in a slightly different algebraic form. We can manipulate our expressions to match them. Let's work on the denominator:\n    Denominator = $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    To get the term `dc` that appears in the options, we can factor out $1/c$ from the denominator:\n    Denominator = $\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the expressions for $V$ and $\\vec{A}$:\n    For the scalar potential $V$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect sign in the denominator (`+` instead of `-`).\n    *   B) Incorrect form for $V$ (static potential), ignores retardation and velocity effects in the denominator.\n    *   C) Incorrect form for both $V$ and $\\vec{A}$.\n    *   D) The expressions for $V$ and $\\vec{A}$ perfectly match our derived results.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:** The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. The key idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the field observed at a point `r` at time `t` was not generated by the charge at its current position and time, but at an earlier position and an earlier time, known as the **retarded time**.\n\n2.  **Define Variables and Relationships:**\n    *   `q`: The point charge.\n    *   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: The time of observation.\n    *   `tr`: The retarded time, which is the time at which the field was generated.\n    *   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `d`: The vector from the source's retarded position to the observation point. `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   `d = |d|`: The distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n3.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the signal to travel from the source at `s(tr)` to the observer at `r` is `d/c`. This must be equal to the time difference `t - tr`.\n    *   `t - tr = d / c`\n    *   This equation implicitly defines `tr` for a given `r` and `t`.\n\n4.  **Starting Point: The Retarded Potentials:** The general solutions for the potentials in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are the retarded potentials:\n    *   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   where `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\n5.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `s(t)`, the densities are:\n    *   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))` (where `δ³` is the 3D Dirac delta function)\n    *   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Scalar Potential (V):**\n    *   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(tr)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   This integral is complicated because the retarded time `tr = t - |r - r'| / c` depends on the integration variable `r'`.\n    *   A standard derivation (e.g., in Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") shows that this dependence introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The volume of the source appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion.\n    *   The result of the integration is:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d * (1 - (d̂ · v)/c))]`\n        where `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observer. The quantities `d`, `d`, and `v` are all evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   Let's simplify the denominator:\n        `d * (1 - (d̂ · v)/c) = d * (1 - (d · v)/(d * c)) = d - (d · v)/c = (cd - d · v) / c`\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for V:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((cd - d · v) / c)]`\n        `V(r, t) = (qc) / (4πε₀ (cd - d · v))`\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Vector Potential (A):**\n    *   We follow a similar procedure for `A(r, t)`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [q * v(tr) * δ³(r' - s(tr)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   Since `v(tr)` is evaluated at the retarded time, it is constant with respect to the integration variable `r'` and can be taken out of the integral.\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * v / 4π) ∫ [δ³(r' - s(tr)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   The integral is exactly the same one we encountered for V, but without the `q/ε₀` factor. Its value is `1 / (d - (d · v)/c)`.\n    *   So, `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * v / 4π) * [1 / (d - (d · v)/c)]`\n    *   Using the simplified denominator from the previous step:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * v / 4π) * [1 / ((cd - d · v) / c)]`\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * c * v) / (4π (cd - d · v))`\n\n8.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   The derived expressions are:\n        `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))`\n        `A(r, t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))`\n    *   These expressions exactly match option D.\n\n9.  **Checking the Relationship between A and V:**\n    *   It is a known result for Liénard-Wiechert potentials that `A = (v/c²) V`. Let's verify this.\n    *   `(v/c²) V = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))] = qv / (4πε₀c (dc - d · v))`\n    *   Now let's simplify our expression for A using the relation `c² = 1/(ε₀μ₀)`, which means `μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²)`.\n    *   `A = ( (1/(ε₀c²)) qc v) / (4π (dc - d · v)) = (qv / (ε₀c)) / (4π (dc - d · v)) = qv / (4πε₀c (dc - d · v))`\n    *   The expressions match, confirming the self-consistency of our results and their relation.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which correspond to option D. The negative sign in the denominator (`dc - d · v`) is crucial and arises from the retardation effect.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   `d`: the magnitude of the vector `d`, so `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   `v`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`, so `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   `c`: the speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   `ε₀`: the permittivity of free space.\n*   `μ₀`: the permeability of free space.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined implicitly by the condition that the signal (electromagnetic field) travels from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r` in the time interval `t - tr`. Since the signal travels at the speed of light `c`, we have:\n`d = c(t - tr)`\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\nwhere the quantities in the square brackets `[]` are evaluated at the retarded time `t' = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)` and velocity `v(t) = s'(t)`, the charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals and evaluating them (a standard but non-trivial derivation found in electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\", Chapter 10) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe evaluation of the integral effectively replaces the volume element `d³r'` with a term that accounts for the motion of the source during the emission of the signal. The result is a factor of `1 / (1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c)`, where `d̂ = d/d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position of the charge to the observer.\n\nThe scalar potential `V` is:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c)))`\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n`d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c) = d - (d * d̂) ⋅ v/c = d - d ⋅ v/c`\n\nSo, `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (d - d ⋅ v/c))`\n\nTo match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (qc / (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nThe vector potential `A` is found similarly:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c)))`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v / (d - d ⋅ v/c))`\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (qc v / (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nIt is also useful to note the relationship between `A` and `V`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ε₀ v) * (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (d - d ⋅ v/c))`\nUsing `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, this becomes:\n`A(r, t) = (v/c²) V(r, t)`\n\nNow let's compare our results with the given options:\n\n**A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c - d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (d c - d⋅v))**\nThis exactly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nB) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r),  A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)\nThis is incorrect. The potential is not the static Coulomb potential (which depends on the instantaneous distance, not the retarded distance `d`, and doesn't account for the velocity correction factor). Also, the relation `A = (v²/c²)V` is dimensionally incorrect as `A` is a vector and `v²` is a scalar.\n\nC) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)\nThis is also incorrect. Although the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` is formally correct, the expression for `V` is the static one and is wrong for a general moving charge.\n\nD) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c + d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (d c + d⋅v))\nThis has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-`. The minus sign is crucial as it describes the Doppler-like effect: when the charge moves towards the observer (`d⋅v > 0`), the potential is stronger, and when it moves away (`d⋅v < 0`), the potential is weaker. A plus sign would incorrectly reverse this physical effect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct one.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion. They are derived directly from Maxwell's equations.\n\nThe calculation must account for the \"retarded time\" ($t_r$), which is the time at which the electromagnetic field was emitted from the charge to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. The signal travels at the speed of light, c, so the time delay is the distance traveled divided by c. This relationship is expressed as:\n\n$t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| / c$\n\nIn the notation of the problem, this becomes:\n\n$t - t_r = d / c$, where $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by the following formulas, where all quantities related to the charge (position, velocity) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$:\n\nThe scalar potential V is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nComparing these standard forms with the given options, we find that option C matches these expressions.\n\nIt's also worth noting the relationship between the vector and scalar potentials:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n\nLet's verify this for option C.\nFrom option C, we have:\n$\\vec{A}/V = (\\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}) / (\\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})})$\n$\\vec{A}/V = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}$\n\nSince $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we get:\n$\\vec{A}/V = \\vec{v}/c^2$, which confirms the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the expressions in option C are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the core concepts:** The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) produced by a moving point charge. These are fundamental quantities in electromagnetism known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. They are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in motion.\n\n2.  **The Role of Retarded Time:** Because electromagnetic interactions propagate at the finite speed of light, $c$, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ do not depend on the charge's position at time $t$, but on its position and velocity at an earlier, or \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The time difference, $t-t_r$, is the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer's position at $t$.\n\n3.  **Define Variables based on the Problem:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge $q$ at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position of the observer (the field point).\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observer.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The magnitude of this vector, i.e., the distance.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is given by: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n4.  **State the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    The term in the denominator, $d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c$, accounts for the fact that the volume element of the charge appears compressed or expanded from the observer's point of view due to the charge's motion (a relativistic effect related to the Doppler shift).\n\n5.  **Simplify and Compare with Options:** To match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fractions by $c$:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** These derived expressions exactly match the formulas given in **Option B**.\n    *   Options A and D represent static or quasi-static approximations, which are incorrect for a general moving charge.\n    *   Option C has an incorrect sign in the denominator, which would lead to unphysical results (e.g., a weaker field for a charge approaching the observer).\n\nThe correct choice is therefore B. The following Python code will print this choice.\n\n```python\n# The Liénard-Wiechert potentials describe the classical electromagnetic effect\n# of a moving electric point charge in terms of a scalar and a vector potential.\n\n# The scalar potential V is given by:\n# V(r,t) = (1 / (4 * pi * epsilon_0)) * [q / (d - d_vec . v_vec / c)]\n# where all terms in the bracket are evaluated at the retarded time tr.\n# d is the magnitude of the vector d_vec.\n\n# The vector potential A is given by:\n# A(r,t) = (mu_0 / (4 * pi)) * [q * v_vec / (d - d_vec . v_vec / c)]\n\n# To match the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n# V(r,t) = (1 / (4 * pi * epsilon_0)) * [q*c / (d*c - d_vec . v_vec)]\n# A(r,t) = (mu_0 / (4 * pi)) * [q*c*v_vec / (d*c - d_vec . v_vec)]\n\n# We can also note the relationship between A and V:\n# A = (v_vec / c^2) * V, since mu_0 * epsilon_0 = 1/c^2.\n\n# Comparing these standard forms with the given options, we find that\n# Option B is the correct one.\n# B) V(r,t) = qc / (4*pi*epsilon_0 * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec)), A(r,t) = (mu_0 * q*c * v_vec) / (4*pi * (d*c - d_vec . v_vec))\n\n# The Python code will now print the correct choice.\ncorrect_choice = 'B'\nprint(\"The correct choice is:\")\nprint(correct_choice)\n\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The correct choice is:\nB\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n*   We have a point charge `q` with a time-dependent position vector `s(t)`.\n*   We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at a specific observation point `r` and time `t`.\n*   The electromagnetic field (and thus the potentials) that we observe at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, `tr`.\n*   The time difference `t - tr` is the time it takes for the signal to travel at the speed of light `c` from the source's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\n**2. Define Key Quantities**\n*   **Retarded position of the charge:** `s(tr)`.\n*   **Retarded velocity of the charge:** `v = ds(t')/dt' |_(t'=tr)`.\n*   **Vector from source to observer:** The problem defines `d` as the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   **Distance from source to observer:** The magnitude of the vector `d` is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   **Retarded time condition:** The time delay for the signal is `d/c`. Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is determined by the implicit equation:\n    `t - tr = d/c`  or  `tr = t - d/c = t - |r - s(tr)|/c`.\n\n**3. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials**\nThe solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials from a time-varying charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n*   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n*   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    where `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\n**4. Apply to a Point Charge**\nFor a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are given by Dirac delta functions:\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals (a non-trivial process that involves a change of variables and properties of the delta function) yields the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n**5. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\nThe result of the integration is:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]_tr`\n    The subscript `tr` means all quantities inside the bracket (`d`, `d`, `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    This expression can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)]_tr`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]_tr`\n    Similarly, rewriting this gives:\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (dc - d ⋅ v)]_tr`\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\nLet's analyze the options based on our derived expressions. Our notation (`d`, `d`, `v`, `tr`) matches that defined in the problem.\n\n*   **A) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)**\n    This is incorrect. The potential `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge. It also uses `r` (distance from origin) instead of `d` (distance from the retarded source position).\n\n*   **B) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc + d ⋅ v))**\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. It should be `(dc - d ⋅ v)`. A plus sign corresponds to advanced potentials, which are generally considered unphysical as they violate causality.\n\n*   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)**\n    This is incorrect. `V` is the static potential, and the relation for `A` is dimensionally and vectorially wrong (`A` is a vector, but `v²V` is a scalar).\n\n*   **D) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))**\n    This option perfectly matches the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    Let's also check the relationship between `A` and `V`. Using `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, we have `μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²)`.\n    `A = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n    `A = (1/(ε₀c²)) * (qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n    `A = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\n    `A = (v/c²) V`\n    The expressions in D are self-consistent and correct.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Option D provides the correct mathematical forms for these potentials using the specified notation.\n\nThe denominator term `(dc - d ⋅ v)` is a relativistic correction factor that accounts for the fact that the \"news\" from the moving charge is compressed or rarefied, similar to the Doppler effect for sound or light waves.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThis problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, so the field at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 1. Defining the Retarded Time\n\nThe retarded time, $t_r$, is the time at which the charge emitted the electromagnetic signal that reaches the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the later time $t$. The signal travels a distance $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$ at the speed of light $c$. Therefore, the time taken for the signal to travel this distance is $d/c$. The relationship between the observation time and the retarded time is:\n\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nThis is an implicit equation for $t_r$.\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar and vector potentials from a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integration is complicated because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard procedure to evaluate this integral yields the following result:\n\nThe effective volume of the charge is compressed by a factor of $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})$, where $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nThe resulting potentials are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\nwhere all quantities in the brackets (d, $\\vec{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's rewrite the derived potentials to match the format of the given options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly for the vector potential:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option C.\n\n*   **Option A** gives the potentials for a static or slowly moving charge in the Coulomb gauge, which is incorrect for a generally moving charge.\n*   **Option B** has an incorrect form for both V and A.\n*   **Option C** matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The denominator $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ correctly captures the relativistic effects, including the Doppler shift.\n*   **Option D** has the incorrect sign in the denominator. A positive sign would imply a decrease in potential as the charge moves towards the observer, which is contrary to the physical effect.\n\nThus, option C provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the electromagnetic field at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$, generated by a charge $q$ that was at a \"retarded\" position at an earlier time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined implicitly by the condition that the time difference $t - t_r$ is equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the source's retarded position to the observation point. Using the notation provided in the question:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$, where $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| = |\\vec{d}|$.\n\nThe derivation of the potentials from Maxwell's equations accounts for the fact that the volume element of the moving charge appears compressed or expanded to the observer, which gives rise to a correction factor in the denominator of the potentials.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\n\nThese can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nIt's also a known relationship that for a moving point charge, the vector potential is related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$.

These potentials account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, c, meaning the field experienced at a point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was generated by the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials starts from the general retarded potential formulas and applies them to a point charge. Let's analyze the expressions given in the options based on the standard form of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe standard formulas for the scalar potential ($V$ or $\\phi$) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) are often written as:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere:\n*   $R$ is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $\\vec{n}$ is the unit vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n*   The subscript $t_r$ means the quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time.\n\nNow, let's translate this into the notation provided in the question:\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector is $d$, so $R=d$.\n*   The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n*   The velocity of the charge is $\\vec{v}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the denominator term $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n$d \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\right) = d \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc} \\right) = d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nTo simplify, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\nFor the scalar potential $V$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that they match option C exactly.

These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and describe the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe derivation accounts for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. This means the field observed at position `\\vec{r}` and time `t` was generated by the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. The key is to evaluate the position and velocity of the charge at this retarded time.\n\nThe standard expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**  `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]`\n*   **Vector Potential (\\vec{A}):** `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]`\n\nIn these formulas, all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.

Option B uses the incorrect static potential, and option D has an incorrect sign in the denominator.

The key idea is that due to the finite speed of light, the field at an observation point **r** at time t is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded\", time `tr`.\n\n1.  **Definitions and Setup:**\n    *   `q`: the point charge.\n    *   `s(t)`: the position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: the field observation point.\n    *   `tr`: the retarded time, the time at which the field observed at `(r, t)` was emitted by the charge.\n    *   The signal (electromagnetic field) travels from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`, arriving at time `t`. The distance traveled is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n    *   The time taken for this travel is `t - tr`.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that due to the finite speed of light, the potentials at a field point `r` at time `t` depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 1. Define Key Quantities\n\n*   **q**: The electric charge.\n*   **`s(t)`**: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n*   **`r`**: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   **`tr`**: The retarded time. It's the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observation point `r` at time `t`. It is defined by the implicit equation:\n    `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n*   **`s(tr)`**: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   **`d`**: The vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point.\n    `d = r - s(tr)`\n*   **d**: The magnitude of `d`, i.e., the distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n    `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`\n*   **`v`**: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    `v = d(s)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   **c**: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   **ε₀**: The permittivity of free space.\n*   **μ₀**: The permeability of free space.\n\nFrom the definition of `tr`, we can write `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials Formulation\n\nThe general formulas for the scalar potential V and vector potential A for a time-varying charge density `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\n### 3. Application to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are represented using Dirac delta functions:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas requires careful evaluation due to the delta function's argument containing the integration variable implicitly through the retarded time. A standard derivation in electromagnetism textbooks (for example, by integrating over time `t'` first) yields the following results:\n\nThe integral for the scalar potential evaluates to:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot v/c))]`\nwhere `\\hat{d} = d / d`.\n\nThe integral for the vector potential evaluates to:\n`A(r,t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot v/c))]`\n\nAll quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, `\\hat{d}`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. Simplification and Comparison with Options\n\nLet's simplify the denominator of these expressions:\n`d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot v/c) = d(1 - (d/d) \\cdot (v/c)) = d - (d \\cdot v)/c`\n\nNow, we can rewrite the potentials:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d \\cdot v)/c)]`\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d \\cdot v)] = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d \\cdot v))`\n\nSimilarly for the vector potential A:\n`A(r,t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - (d \\cdot v)/c)]`\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n`A(r,t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qcv / (dc - d \\cdot v)] = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π(dc - d \\cdot v))`\n\nNow let's compare these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** `V(...) = ... / (dc + d·v)`, `A(...) = ... / (dc + d·v)`. The sign is incorrect. This would correspond to advanced potentials, not retarded potentials.\n*   **B)** `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`, `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`. This matches our derived expressions perfectly.\n*   **C)** `V = q / (4πε₀r)`. This is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge. It ignores the effects of retardation and the velocity-dependent term in the denominator.\n*   **D)** `V = q / (4πε₀r)`, `A = (v²/c²)V`. The potential V is incorrect, and the expression for A is vectorially incorrect (`v²` is a scalar).\n\nThus, the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThis question asks for the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Concept: Retarded Potentials**\n    Because electromagnetic influences travel at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potential at a specific point in space `r` and time `t` does not depend on the *current* state of the charge, but on its state at an earlier, or **retarded time**, `t_r`. The retarded time is defined by the condition that the time difference, `t - t_r`, is exactly the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r`.\n\n2.  **Defining the Variables (as per the problem statement)**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `t_r`.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The field point where the potential is measured.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance the signal traveled.\n    *   The retarded time condition is: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} |_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n    The potentials are derived by solving the general retarded potential integral equations for the specific case of a point charge. This calculation yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The standard forms are:\n\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n    The term $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of retardation. The dot product $\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ represents a Doppler-like effect; the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer and weaker if it is moving away.\n\n4.  **Matching the Formula to the Options**\n    The expressions in the options are written in a slightly different algebraic form. We can rewrite the standard formulas by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    Comparing these results with the given choices:\n    *   A) has the wrong sign in the denominator (`+` instead of `-`).\n    *   B) and C) use the simple static Coulomb potential form for `V`, which is incorrect as it neglects the velocity-dependent term in the denominator.\n    *   D) perfectly matches our derived expressions for both `V` and `A`.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Identify the Setup\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   **Observer:** Located at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`. The potentials at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, $t_r$. This is the time when the signal that reaches the observer at time `t` was emitted from the charge.\n*   **Retarded Position:** The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   **Vector from Source to Observer:** The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observer is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   **Retarded Velocity:** The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=t_r}$.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Time Condition\n\nThe time it takes for the signal to travel the distance `d` is $d/c$. This must equal the time difference between emission and observation:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nThis equation implicitly defines the retarded time $t_r$ for a given observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$. All quantities related to the source (its position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, velocity $\\vec{v}$, and the separation vector $\\vec{d}$) must be evaluated at this retarded time.\n\n### 3. The Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials from time-varying charge and current densities are the retarded potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} dV'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} dV'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nFor a point charge, the densities are:\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 4. Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nSubstituting these densities into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals is a non-trivial process because the retarded time depends on the integration variable. The key step involves a change of variables that introduces a correction factor.\n\nThe effect is that the charge `q` must be divided by a factor $1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}$, which accounts for the \"bunching up\" of the field lines due to the charge's motion (a Doppler-like effect). This factor is often written as $\\kappa = 1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c$.\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    The integral effectively evaluates to:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    The subscript \"ret\" signifies that all quantities in the bracket ($d, \\hat{d}, \\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    Using the notation given in the problem, where $\\vec{d}$ and $\\vec{v}$ are already defined at $t_r$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - d(\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    To match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    The derivation is analogous. The source of the vector potential is the current $q\\vec{v}$.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    Again, using the problem's notation:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5.

Let's translate this into the notation provided in the question:\n*   $R$ is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$, which is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, so $R = |\\vec{d}| = d$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{\\beta}$ is the normalized velocity $\\vec{v}/c$.\n*   $\\hat{n}$ is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observation point, which is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n\nSubstituting this notation into the scalar potential formula:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - (\\vec{v}/c) \\cdot (\\vec{d}/d))}$\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d})/c} = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThis matches the expression for the scalar potential in option B.\n\nNow, for the vector potential, we can use the known relationship $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nUsing the identity $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o \\mu_o)$, we can substitute $\\mu_o c = 1/(\\epsilon_o c)$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThis expression matches the vector potential in option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given by option B. Options A and D incorrectly use the static potential form, which does not account for retardation effects. Option C has an incorrect sign in the denominator.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nThe correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($ \\vec{A} $) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic signals propagate at the finite speed of light, c. This means the potential measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ and time *t* is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials starts from the general formulas for retarded potentials and incorporates the charge and current density of a moving point source. A crucial part of the derivation involves integrating over the volume of the charge and accounting for the change in retarded time as the observation point moves, which leads to a correction factor in the denominator.\n\nThe scalar potential V is given by:\n$ V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r} $\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by *c* yields the form:\n$ V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} $\n\nHere, all quantities on the right side are evaluated at the retarded time *tr*. The term $ (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) $ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source.\n\nThe vector potential $ \\vec{A} $ is similarly found to be:\n$ \\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r} $\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n$ \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} $\n\nThese two potentials are related by $ \\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V $. Comparing these expressions to the given options, we find that option D matches the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nThe expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light, c. This means the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined implicitly by the relation $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$, where $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge *q* at the retarded time, and *d* is the distance from this retarded position to the observation point.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by the following formulas:\n\nThe scalar potential V is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAnd the vector potential A is:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nIn these expressions:\n*   *q* is the charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$ is the permeability of free space.\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d$ is the magnitude of $\\vec{d}$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   *c* is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nTo match these standard forms to the given options, we can manipulate the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by *c*:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese resulting expressions match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
