The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can know both the energy of a particle and the time for which it has that energy.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth or energy width of the state).\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which we can take as the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor an energy level to be well-defined, its uncertainty (ΔE) must be small. A finite lifetime (τ) leads to a non-zero energy uncertainty.\n\nLet's calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, their energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV), and this width is the primary factor limiting our ability to resolve the levels.\n\nTherefore, the required energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two widths:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁴ eV\nB) 10⁻⁹ eV\nC) 10⁻⁸ eV\nD) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\nComparing these options to our required condition (|E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV):\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is large enough to be resolved.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is not resolvable.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is not resolvable.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is not resolvable.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is significantly larger than the natural energy broadening caused by their finite lifetimes.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo clearly distinguish between two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as it applies to energy and time.\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time is given by the relation: ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π). This principle implies that a state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy. The shorter the lifetime of a state, the larger the uncertainty in its energy.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each quantum state. We can approximate the minimum uncertainty using ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\nThe value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in electron-volts seconds (eV·s) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor the first state (State 1):\n*   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nFor the second state (State 2):\n*   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference (ΔE_diff) must be significantly larger than the individual energy uncertainties. A common criterion for resolvability is that the energy difference should be at least the sum of the individual energy uncertainties:\n\nΔE_diff > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\nΔE_diff > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nΔE_diff > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\nΔE_diff > 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, let's examine the given options to see which one satisfies this condition:\n\nA) 10⁻¹¹ eV\nB) 10⁻⁸ eV\nC) 10⁻⁹ eV\nD) 10⁻⁴ eV\n\nComparing our calculated minimum energy difference with the options:\n*   10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV would be sufficient to clearly distinguish these two energy levels.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt or τ) to the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is given by ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ, where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant. This means a state with a shorter lifetime has a larger \"spread\" or uncertainty in its energy.\n\n2.  **Establish the Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (or \"widths\"). So, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.\n\n3.  **Calculate Energy Uncertainties:**\n    *   I will use the value of the reduced Planck constant in electron-volt-seconds (eV·s), which is approximately ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. This avoids an extra conversion step from Joules.\n    *   I will calculate the energy uncertainty for the first state (ΔE1) using its lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   I will calculate the energy uncertainty for the second state (ΔE2) using its lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n\n4.  **Determine Minimum Energy Difference:**\n    *   I will sum the two energy uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to find the minimum energy difference required to resolve the two levels.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   I will compare this calculated minimum energy difference with the four given options (A, B, C, D).\n    *   The correct option will be the one that is significantly larger than the calculated minimum required separation.\n\n6.  **Final Output:** The code will print the step-by-step calculations and then identify the correct choice from the list.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16  \n# Lifetime of the first state in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9  \n# Lifetime of the second state in seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  \n\n# The options for the energy difference in eV\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-8,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"This problem uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\")\nprint(\"The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the lifetime of a state (τ) are related by ΔE * τ ≈ ħ.\")\nprint(\"To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (widths).\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state\n# ΔE = ħ / τ\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 1 (τ1): {tau1:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 2 (τ2): {tau2:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the minimum required energy difference for resolution\n# The condition is |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\nmin_energy_diff = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(\"The minimum energy difference required to resolve the two states is the sum of their uncertainties:\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required difference = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = {min_energy_diff:.3e} eV\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Compare the minimum required difference with the given options\nprint(\"Now, we check which option is greater than this minimum required difference:\")\ncorrect_option = None\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    is_resolvable = value > min_energy_diff\n    print(f\"Option {option}) {value:.1e} eV: Is it > {min_energy_diff:.3e} eV? -> {is_resolvable}\")\n    if is_resolvable:\n        correct_option = option\n\nprint(f\"\\nBased on the calculations, the only energy difference large enough to resolve the two states is option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer Choice: {correct_option}\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: This problem uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the lifetime of a state (τ) are related by ΔE * τ ≈ ħ.\nTo clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (widths).\n\nLifetime of state 1 (τ1): 1.0e-09 s\nEnergy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\n\nLifetime of state 2 (τ2): 1.0e-08 s\nEnergy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\n\nThe minimum energy difference required to resolve the two states is the sum of their uncertainties:\nMinimum required difference = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 7.240e-07 eV\n\nNow, we check which option is greater than this minimum required difference:\nOption A) 1.0e-11 eV: Is it > 7.240e-07 eV? -> False\nOption B) 1.0e-08 eV: Is it > 7.240e-07 eV? -> False\nOption C) 1.0e-04 eV: Is it > 7.240e-07 eV? -> True\nOption D) 1.0e-09 eV: Is it > 7.240e-07 eV? -> False\n\nBased on the calculations, the only energy difference large enough to resolve the two states is option C.\nFinal Answer Choice: C\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required energy difference to resolve the two quantum states.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem involves the lifetime of quantum states and the ability to distinguish their energies. This directly relates to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The formula is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n3.  **Understand the Concept of \"Resolving\" Energy Levels:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguished,\" the difference in their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths (ΔE1 and ΔE2). If the energy difference is smaller than or comparable to the energy widths, the levels will overlap and appear as a single, broad peak. The level with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this width is the primary limiting factor for resolution.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ sec\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ sec\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   We have two energy widths: ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   State 1 has a shorter lifetime, so it has a larger energy uncertainty (it is \"broader\"). This broader width is the main obstacle to resolving the two levels.\n    *   To clearly distinguish the two levels, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two widths. A good rule of thumb is that the separation should be at least as large as the sum of the widths, but as a minimum condition, it must be larger than the broadest level.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: **|E1 - E2| > ΔE1**\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Given Options:** We need to find the option that satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would completely overlap. Not resolvable.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would still overlap significantly. Not clearly resolvable.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is even smaller and thus not resolvable.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than the required minimum separation (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV). With this energy difference, the two levels would be very clearly separated, as their natural widths would be negligible in comparison to their separation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Uncertainty Principle:** The core of the problem is the inverse relationship between lifetime and energy uncertainty. A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more uncertain energy.\n*   **Limiting Factor:** The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width and is therefore the limiting factor in resolving the two levels.\n*   **\"Clearly Resolved\" Condition:** This means the separation must be significantly greater than the energy widths, not just equal to or slightly larger.\n*   **Units:** Ensure consistent units. The Planck constant was used in eV·s to directly obtain the energy uncertainty in eV, which matches the units of the options.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy width of the broader state is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly resolve the two states, their energy difference must be significantly larger than this value. Among the given options, only 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy.\n\n**1.

This requirement stems from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: The energy-time uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) are related. A common form of this relationship is ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).

Therefore, the minimum energy uncertainty, or the natural linewidth (ΔE), can be estimated as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n    *   **For the first state (E1)**:\n        *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For the second state (E2)**:\n        *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution**: To clearly distinguish two energy levels, their energy separation must be larger than their energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the broader of the two linewidths. In this case, the first state has a shorter lifetime, which results in a larger energy width (ΔE1 > ΔE2).\n    *   The condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**: We compare the given options with this condition:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly greater than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved, as it is much larger than the natural linewidth of the broader state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step explanation to find the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Principle:** The problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.

This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation: `ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2`. Here, `ΔE` is the uncertainty in the energy of a state (also called the natural linewidth), `Δt` is the lifetime of the state, and `ħ` (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   For each state, we can calculate its energy uncertainty (`ΔE`) using its given lifetime (`Δt`). We'll use the approximation `ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt`.\n    *   The state with the shorter lifetime will have a larger energy uncertainty.\n    *   To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish the two energy levels, the difference in their energies (`|E1 - E2|`) must be significantly larger than the individual energy uncertainties.

We are given the lifetimes of these two states. The key concept here is the relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the uncertainty in its energy.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The core principle connecting lifetime and energy is the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2.\n2.  **Interpretation:** In this context, Δt is the lifetime (τ) of the state, and ΔE is the inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (Γ) of the energy level. So, the minimum energy width of a state is given by Γ ≈ ħ/τ. A shorter lifetime implies a larger energy width, meaning the energy of the state is less precisely defined.\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels (or spectral lines) to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E2 - E1|, must be significantly larger than the energy widths of the individual levels (Γ1 and Γ2). Specifically, the energy separation must be greater than the width of the broader level.\n4.  **Constants and Units:** The options are given in electron-volts (eV).

Identify the core physics principle:**\nThe question asks about \"clearly distinguishing\" or \"resolving\" two energy levels, each with a given \"lifetime\". This points directly to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time.\n\n**2. State the principle:**\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) and the uncertainty in time ($\\Delta t$) are related by the inequality:\n$\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**3. Apply the principle to the problem:**\n*   The lifetime of a state ($\\tau$) is the characteristic time interval for that state. We can use this as $\\Delta t$. So, $\\Delta t_1 = \\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s and $\\Delta t_2 = \\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s.\n*   This lifetime imposes a fundamental uncertainty in the energy of the state, often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy broadening\". This is the inherent \"fuzziness\" of the energy level. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can use the approximation:\n    $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n*   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s, which is $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s.\n\n**4.

Define the \"resolvability\" condition:**\n*   For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference in their central energies ($|E_1 - E_2|$) must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two \"fuzzy\" energy levels will overlap too much to be distinguished.\n*   The limiting factor is the state with the *larger* energy width. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy uncertainty. In this case, state 1 has the shorter lifetime ($\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s) and thus the larger energy width ($\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV).\n*   Therefore, the condition for resolvability is:\n    $|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n**6.

The code output shows that the required separation must be greater than ~6.582e-07 eV and that only option C (1e-4 eV) satisfies this condition.\n\nFinal Answer should be C. The problem requires us to determine the minimum energy difference needed to clearly distinguish two quantum states with given lifetimes. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) and the uncertainty in time ($\\Delta t$) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$). The formula is:\n    $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n\n2.  **Relating Lifetime to Energy Uncertainty:** The lifetime of a quantum state ($\\tau$) represents the characteristic time scale over which the state exists. We can use this lifetime as the time uncertainty, so $\\Delta t \\approx \\tau$. This lifetime imposes a fundamental \"blur\" or uncertainty in the energy of the state, known as the natural linewidth. For calculation purposes, we can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty as:\n    $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n\n3.  **Resolvability Condition:** To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their central energies ($|E_1 - E_2|$) must be greater than their energy widths ($\\Delta E$). If the two states have different energy widths, the larger width is the limiting factor. The two levels will overlap and be indistinguishable if their energy difference is smaller than this larger width. Therefore, the condition is:\n    $|E_1 - E_2| > \\max(\\Delta E_1, \\Delta E_2)$\n\n4.  **Calculations:**\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant is $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}$.\n    *   The lifetimes are given as $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s and $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s.\n\n    *   **Calculate the energy width for State 1:**\n        $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n    *   **Calculate the energy width for State 2:**\n        $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV.\n\n    *   **Determine the required separation:** The larger energy width corresponds to the shorter lifetime ($\\tau_1$).

This energy uncertainty is a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) are inversely related. A quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a precisely defined energy.

This is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can know both the energy of a particle and the time for which it has that energy.\n\nThe mathematical relationship is:\n**ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2**\n\nWhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy. For an unstable state, this can be interpreted as the \"width\" or \"spread\" of the energy level. It's not a perfectly sharp value.\n*   **Δt** is the uncertainty in time. For an unstable state, this is taken to be its lifetime (τ).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\nFor practical calculations and estimations, we often use the approximation:\n**ΔE ≈ ħ / τ**\n\n### Step 2: Identify and List Careful Points\n\n1.  **Inverse Relationship:** A shorter lifetime (τ) leads to a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE). A longer lifetime leads to a smaller energy uncertainty (a \"sharper\" energy level).\n2.  **Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly resolve\" or \"distinguish\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their individual energy widths. At a minimum, the separation must be larger than the width of the *broader* energy level.\n3.  **Identify the Broader Level:** The broader energy level is the one with the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE). According to the uncertainty principle, this corresponds to the state with the **shorter lifetime**.\n4.  **Consistent Units:** The lifetimes are given in seconds, and the options for energy difference are in electron-volts (eV). We must use a value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) that is consistent with these units.

This broader width will be the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy width (ΔE₁) of the broader state (state 1).**\n    *   Using the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ:\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **(Optional) Calculate the energy width of the other state (state 2).**\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   As expected, ΔE₁ > ΔE₂.\n\n5.  **Apply the condition for resolution.**\n    *   To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy separation |E₁ - E₂| must be larger than the width of the broader level, ΔE₁.\n    *   Required condition: **|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁**\n    *   Required condition: **|E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n6.  **Compare this requirement with the given options.**\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** Is 10⁻⁸ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No. The separation is smaller than the width. The levels would overlap too much.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** Is 10⁻⁹ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** Is 10⁻¹¹ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** Is 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? Yes. (Since 10⁻⁴ is 1000 x 10⁻⁷, it is much larger). This separation is significantly larger than the energy width of the broader state, so the two levels could be clearly distinguished.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe minimum energy difference required to resolve the levels is determined by the natural energy width of the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s), which is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.

This principle dictates that a quantum state's finite lifetime introduces an inherent uncertainty, or \"broadening,\" in its energy level. This is often referred to as the natural linewidth.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** For energy and time, the principle is expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. A quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a precisely defined energy.\n*   **Natural Linewidth:** The energy uncertainty (ΔE) is also known as the natural linewidth (Γ) of the spectral line. To resolve two distinct energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than this linewidth. The shorter the lifetime of a state, the broader its energy uncertainty.\n*   **Resolvability Condition:** To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, E1 and E2, the energy separation |E1 - E2| must be larger than the energy uncertainty of each state.

This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as it applies to energy and time.\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time is given by the relation: ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π). This principle implies that a state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy. The shorter the lifetime of a state, the larger the uncertainty in its energy.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each quantum state.

This directly relates to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The formula is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n3.  **Understand the Concept of \"Resolving\" Energy Levels:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguished,\" the difference in their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths (ΔE1 and ΔE2). If the energy difference is smaller than or comparable to the energy widths, the levels will overlap and appear as a single, broad peak. The level with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this width is the primary limiting factor for resolution.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ sec\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ sec\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   We have two energy widths: ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   State 1 has a shorter lifetime, so it has a larger energy uncertainty (it is \"broader\"). This broader width is the main obstacle to resolving the two levels.\n    *   To clearly distinguish the two levels, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two widths. A good rule of thumb is that the separation should be at least as large as the sum of the widths, but as a minimum condition, it must be larger than the broadest level.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: **|E1 - E2| > ΔE1**\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Given Options:** We need to find the option that satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would completely overlap. Not resolvable.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would still overlap significantly. Not clearly resolvable.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is even smaller and thus not resolvable.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than the required minimum separation (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV). With this energy difference, the two levels would be very clearly separated, as their natural widths would be negligible in comparison to their separation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Uncertainty Principle:** The core of the problem is the inverse relationship between lifetime and energy uncertainty. A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more uncertain energy.\n*   **Limiting Factor:** The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width and is therefore the limiting factor in resolving the two levels.\n*   **\"Clearly Resolved\" Condition:** This means the separation must be significantly greater than the energy widths, not just equal to or slightly larger.\n*   **Units:** Ensure consistent units. The Planck constant was used in eV·s to directly obtain the energy uncertainty in eV, which matches the units of the options.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy width of the broader state is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly resolve the two states, their energy difference must be significantly larger than this value.

To resolve two levels, the separation between them must be larger than their combined widths, and certainly larger than the width of the broader level.\n\nLet's calculate the energy width for each state:\n\n1.  **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width Γ₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   Γ₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width Γ₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   Γ₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe energy level for state 1 is significantly broader (Γ₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) than state 2 because its lifetime is shorter. For the two levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this larger width.\n\nNow, let's compare this requirement with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the energy width of either state.

The levels would not be resolved.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also much smaller than the energy width of state 1. The levels would not be resolved.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This energy difference is about 150 times larger than the energy width of the broader state (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV). This separation is sufficient to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.\n\nTherefore, the only energy difference that allows for the clear resolution of the two levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe user wants me to solve the problem based on the provided thinking process and code output.\n\n**1.

This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation: `ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2`. Here, `ΔE` is the uncertainty in the energy of a state (also called the natural linewidth), `Δt` is the lifetime of the state, and `ħ` (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   For each state, we can calculate its energy uncertainty (`ΔE`) using its given lifetime (`Δt`). We'll use the approximation `ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt`.\n    *   The state with the shorter lifetime will have a larger energy uncertainty.\n    *   To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish the two energy levels, the difference in their energies (`|E1 - E2|`) must be significantly larger than the individual energy uncertainties.

Therefore, the condition is `|E1 - E2| > ΔE_larger`.\n    *   The state with the shorter lifetime (`t1 = 10^-9` sec) will have the larger energy width (`ΔE1`). We need to calculate this value.\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant (`ħ`) in units of electron-volt seconds (eV·s) is approximately `6.582 x 10^-16 eV·s`.

We are given the lifetimes of these two states. The key concept here is the relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the uncertainty in its energy.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The core principle connecting lifetime and energy is the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2.\n2.  **Interpretation:** In this context, Δt is the lifetime (τ) of the state, and ΔE is the inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (Γ) of the energy level. So, the minimum energy width of a state is given by Γ ≈ ħ/τ. A shorter lifetime implies a larger energy width, meaning the energy of the state is less precisely defined.\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels (or spectral lines) to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E2 - E1|, must be significantly larger than the energy widths of the individual levels (Γ1 and Γ2). Specifically, the energy separation must be greater than the width of the broader level.\n4.  **Constants and Units:** The options are given in electron-volts (eV). Therefore, it is convenient to use the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s:\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy width (Γ1) of the first state.**\n*   The lifetime of the first state is τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s.\n*   The energy width is calculated using the uncertainty principle: Γ1 ≈ ħ / τ1.\n*   Γ1 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n*   Γ1 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the energy width (Γ2) of the second state.**\n*   The lifetime of the second state is τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n*   The energy width is calculated as: Γ2 ≈ ħ / τ2.\n*   Γ2 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n*   Γ2 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 3: Determine the condition for resolving the two energy levels.**\n*   The two energy widths are Γ1 ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV and Γ2 ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n*   The first state has a shorter lifetime and therefore a larger energy width (Γ1 > Γ2). This larger width is the main factor limiting our ability to distinguish the two levels.\n*   For the levels to be clearly resolved, their energy separation, |E2 - E1|, must be greater than the larger of the two widths.\n*   Therefore, the condition is: |E2 - E1| > Γ1, which means |E2 - E1| > 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options based on this condition.**\n*   We are looking for an energy difference that is significantly larger than ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ eV is about 150 times larger). This separation would allow the levels to be very clearly resolved.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This value is much smaller than both Γ1 and Γ2. The levels would completely overlap and be indistinguishable.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This value (10⁻⁸ eV) is smaller than the larger width Γ1 (6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). Therefore, the levels could not be clearly resolved.\n*   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This value is extremely small compared to both energy widths. The levels would be completely indistinguishable.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion.**\nOnly the energy difference in option A is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe user wants me to solve a physics problem.\n\n**1. Identify the core physics principle:**\nThe question asks about \"clearly distinguishing\" or \"resolving\" two energy levels, each with a given \"lifetime\". This points directly to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time.\n\n**2. State the principle:**\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) and the uncertainty in time ($\\Delta t$) are related by the inequality:\n$\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**3. Apply the principle to the problem:**\n*   The lifetime of a state ($\\tau$) is the characteristic time interval for that state. We can use this as $\\Delta t$. So, $\\Delta t_1 = \\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s and $\\Delta t_2 = \\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s.\n*   This lifetime imposes a fundamental uncertainty in the energy of the state, often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy broadening\". This is the inherent \"fuzziness\" of the energy level. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can use the approximation:\n    $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n*   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s, which is $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s.\n\n**4. Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:**\n*   **State 1:**\n    $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   **State 2:**\n    $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV.\n\n**5. Define the \"resolvability\" condition:**\n*   For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference in their central energies ($|E_1 - E_2|$) must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two \"fuzzy\" energy levels will overlap too much to be distinguished.\n*   The limiting factor is the state with the *larger* energy width. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy uncertainty. In this case, state 1 has the shorter lifetime ($\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s) and thus the larger energy width ($\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV).\n*   Therefore, the condition for resolvability is:\n    $|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n**6. Evaluate the given options against this condition:**\nWe need to find an energy difference that is greater than approximately $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n*   A) $10^{-8}$ eV: This is smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. (Not resolvable)\n*   B) $10^{-11}$ eV: This is much smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. (Not resolvable)\n*   C) $10^{-4}$ eV: This is much larger than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. (Resolvable)\n*   D) $10^{-9}$ eV: This is smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. (Not resolvable)\n\n**7. Conclusion:**\nOnly option C provides an energy separation large enough to clearly resolve the two states, given the lifetime broadening of the state with the shorter lifetime.\n\nThe Python code was used to perform these calculations precisely and systematically check the options, confirming the manual reasoning. The code output shows that the required separation must be greater than ~6.582e-07 eV and that only option C (1e-4 eV) satisfies this condition.\n\nFinal Answer should be C. The problem requires us to determine the minimum energy difference needed to clearly distinguish two quantum states with given lifetimes. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) and the uncertainty in time ($\\Delta t$) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$). The formula is:\n    $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n\n2.  **Relating Lifetime to Energy Uncertainty:** The lifetime of a quantum state ($\\tau$) represents the characteristic time scale over which the state exists. We can use this lifetime as the time uncertainty, so $\\Delta t \\approx \\tau$. This lifetime imposes a fundamental \"blur\" or uncertainty in the energy of the state, known as the natural linewidth. For calculation purposes, we can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty as:\n    $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n\n3.  **Resolvability Condition:** To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their central energies ($|E_1 - E_2|$) must be greater than their energy widths ($\\Delta E$). If the two states have different energy widths, the larger width is the limiting factor. The two levels will overlap and be indistinguishable if their energy difference is smaller than this larger width. Therefore, the condition is:\n    $|E_1 - E_2| > \\max(\\Delta E_1, \\Delta E_2)$\n\n4.  **Calculations:**\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant is $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}$.\n    *   The lifetimes are given as $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s and $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s.\n\n    *   **Calculate the energy width for State 1:**\n        $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n    *   **Calculate the energy width for State 2:**\n        $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV.\n\n    *   **Determine the required separation:** The larger energy width corresponds to the shorter lifetime ($\\tau_1$). Thus, the limiting energy width is $\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be greater than this value.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We need to find the option that is greater than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   A) $10^{-8}$ eV: This is less than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   B) $10^{-11}$ eV: This is much less than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   C) $10^{-4}$ eV: This is much greater than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   D) $10^{-9}$ eV: This is less than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough to overcome the natural linewidths of the states, allowing them to be clearly resolved. The code output confirms these calculations.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly greater than the energy broadening, or uncertainty, of each level. This energy uncertainty is a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) are inversely related. A quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a precisely defined energy. The lifetime of an excited state (τ) gives a measure of the uncertainty in time (Δt), which in turn determines the minimum uncertainty in its energy, often called the natural linewidth. The relationship can be approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).

The shorter-lived state has a much larger energy uncertainty, which dominates this requirement. The minimum energy difference required is at least on the order of the larger uncertainty, ΔE1.\n\nThe total linewidth is the sum of the individual uncertainties:\nΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, we compare this required energy difference with the given options:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is significantly larger than the calculated minimum required difference of 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the required difference.\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required difference.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also smaller than the required difference.\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved, as it is well above the natural linewidths of both states.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo determine if two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, we must consider the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.

This is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can know both the energy of a particle and the time for which it has that energy.\n\nThe mathematical relationship is:\n**ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2**\n\nWhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy. For an unstable state, this can be interpreted as the \"width\" or \"spread\" of the energy level. It's not a perfectly sharp value.\n*   **Δt** is the uncertainty in time. For an unstable state, this is taken to be its lifetime (τ).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\nFor practical calculations and estimations, we often use the approximation:\n**ΔE ≈ ħ / τ**\n\n### Step 2: Identify and List Careful Points\n\n1.  **Inverse Relationship:** A shorter lifetime (τ) leads to a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE). A longer lifetime leads to a smaller energy uncertainty (a \"sharper\" energy level).\n2.  **Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly resolve\" or \"distinguish\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their individual energy widths. At a minimum, the separation must be larger than the width of the *broader* energy level.\n3.  **Identify the Broader Level:** The broader energy level is the one with the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE). According to the uncertainty principle, this corresponds to the state with the **shorter lifetime**.\n4.  **Consistent Units:** The lifetimes are given in seconds, and the options for energy difference are in electron-volts (eV). We must use a value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) that is consistent with these units. The most convenient value to use is:\n    *   **ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Given Information:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n\n2.  **Identify the state with the shorter lifetime.**\n    *   τ₁ (10⁻⁹ s) is shorter than τ₂ (10⁻⁸ s).\n    *   Therefore, state 1 will have the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) and will be the broader energy level. This broader width will be the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy width (ΔE₁) of the broader state (state 1).**\n    *   Using the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ:\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **(Optional) Calculate the energy width of the other state (state 2).**\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   As expected, ΔE₁ > ΔE₂.\n\n5.  **Apply the condition for resolution.**\n    *   To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy separation |E₁ - E₂| must be larger than the width of the broader level, ΔE₁.\n    *   Required condition: **|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁**\n    *   Required condition: **|E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n6.  **Compare this requirement with the given options.**\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** Is 10⁻⁸ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No. The separation is smaller than the width. The levels would overlap too much.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** Is 10⁻⁹ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** Is 10⁻¹¹ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** Is 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? Yes. (Since 10⁻⁴ is 1000 x 10⁻⁷, it is much larger). This separation is significantly larger than the energy width of the broader state, so the two levels could be clearly distinguished.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe minimum energy difference required to resolve the levels is determined by the natural energy width of the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s), which is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.

For two energy levels to be clearly distinguishable, their energy separation must be significantly greater than their individual energy widths.\n\nFirst, we identify the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of electronvolt-seconds (eV·s):\nħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nNext, we calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state using their respective lifetimes (τ):\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁), which is the dominant factor for resolution. For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be substantially larger than this dominant energy width.\n\nThe condition is: |E₁ - E₂| >> ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nNow let's compare this requirement with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (Much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV  (Smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV  (Much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV  (Much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than the energy width of either state. This large separation ensures that the inherent \"blur\" of the energy levels does not cause them to overlap, allowing them to be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than the natural energy width of each level. This energy width is a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that a finite lifetime (Δt) of a state leads to an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy uncertainty (or energy width), Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Using the lifetime (τ) as Δt, the minimum energy width for a state is approximately:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy width for each of the two quantum states using the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**For the first state (E₁):**\n*   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**For the second state (E₂):**\n*   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the energy difference between them (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.\n\nRequired energy difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nRequired energy difference > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\nRequired energy difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, we compare this requirement with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough to ensure that the two energy levels do not overlap and can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
