The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm is next to an alkyl group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent:\n        *   A multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH group attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   A multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n        *   A doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) indicates a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group.\n        *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) indicates a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n    *   Assembling these fragments—a CH, a CH₂, and two CH₃ groups—and considering their splitting patterns, the alkyl group is identified as a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n\nBased on this analysis, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI\n\nThe reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a strong reduction. This reagent combination is known to completely reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The general reaction is:\n\nR-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂\n\nIn this specific case, the 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced. The carboxylic acid functional group is converted to a methyl group, while the *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n\nThe correct final product is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak at `3400–2500 cm-1` is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at `1720 cm-1` corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1` indicate the presence of a C=C bond in an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   The remaining signals (`2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`) must describe the other substituent on the ring. Let's piece it together:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` is a -CH3 group next to a -CH2 group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` is a -CH2 group next to the -CH3 and a -CH group. This confirms an ethyl fragment (-CH2CH3).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` is a -CH3 group next to a -CH group.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is a -CH group attached to the benzene ring, the ethyl group, and the methyl group.\n        *   Assembling these fragments gives a `sec-butyl` group: -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3).\n    *   Conclusion from NMR: The compound has a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm) is indicative of a **para-disubstituted** (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is due to protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Analyzing the alkyl group signals:** We need to piece together the structure from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).

In conjunction with the broad O-H band, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹:** This absorption suggests C=C stretching, which is characteristic of an aromatic ring.\n*   **1450 cm⁻¹:** This is within the region for C-H bending vibrations.\n\nThe IR data strongly indicate that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet at such a high chemical shift is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both appearing as doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring.

This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield because it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is further upfield, suggesting it is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, likely a CH group attached to multiple other carbons.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, suggesting a CH₂ group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, which is a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, indicating a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n\n**Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\nLet's piece together the alkyl substituent from its NMR signals. We have a -CH(CH₃)- fragment (from the 2.9 ppm and 1.4 ppm signals) and a -CH₂CH₃ fragment (from the 1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm signals). Combining these, the most logical structure for the alkyl chain is a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. The CH at 2.9 ppm is the proton attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**Structure of Compound X:**\nCombining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Product of the Reaction**\n\nThe problem states that Compound X, which we've identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and HI are a powerful reducing agent system.\n*   **Reaction:** This combination is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The general reaction is R-COOH → R-CH₃. It is a strong reduction that will not stop at the alcohol stage. The aromatic ring and the existing alkyl group will remain unaffected by these conditions.\n\n**Applying the Reaction to Compound X:**\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group at position 1 of the benzene ring is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.

This is the starting material.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\n### Identification of the Final Product\n\nTo determine the final product, we must first deduce the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from its spectral data and then identify the product of its reaction with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n#### Step 1: Structure Elucidation of Compound X\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n*   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n*   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can conclude that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded.\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂) situated between two different proton environments (e.g., a methyl and a methine group).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton suggests a methine group (-CH) bonded to the benzene ring and adjacent to multiple protons.\n\n**Assembling the Structure:**\nThe alkyl signals piece together to form a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]. This group is attached to the benzene ring at the methine carbon. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n#### Step 2: The Chemical Reaction\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is well-established that Red P and HI will completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction is a full reduction of the carboxyl group to an alkane.\n\n#### Step 3: Determining the Final Product\n\nThe reduction of the carboxylic acid group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will result in the formation of a methyl group, while the *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring remain intact.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nThis structure matches option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Compound X from the Spectral Data\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, using the provided infrared (IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) data.\n\n**IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.

The fragments are a -CH group, a -CH₂ group, a CH-CH₃ group, and a -CH₂-CH₃ group. The only way to combine these to form a single C₄H₉ alkyl group that fits all the splitting patterns is a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃].\n\n*   The **CH** at 2.9 ppm is attached to the ring, a methyl group, and a methylene group.\n*   The **CH₃** at 1.4 ppm is attached to the benzylic CH, creating a doublet.\n*   The **CH₂** at 1.7 ppm is adjacent to both the benzylic CH and the terminal methyl group, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n*   The terminal **CH₃** at 0.9 ppm is adjacent to the CH₂ group, creating a triplet.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which corresponds to option (A).\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction\n\nCompound X, identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\nThis combination of reagents (red P and HI) is a very powerful reducing agent.

The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which, in combination with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can confidently conclude that compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) data allows us to determine the precise structure of the molecule.\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very deshielded, broad singlet corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**).

The protons at 7.2 ppm are adjacent to the other substituent, which must be an alkyl group.\n    *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Group (0.9 ppm to 2.9 ppm):** We can deduce the structure of the alkyl chain by analyzing its signals:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This points to an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons represents the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the methyl and methine protons.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton represents the methine proton (-CH-). Its downfield shift suggests it is directly attached to the aromatic ring (it is a benzylic proton). It is a multiplet because it is coupled to the protons of the adjacent methyl and methylene groups.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** The alkyl substituent has a methine carbon attached to the ring, which is also bonded to a methyl group and an ethyl group. This is a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n**Step 2: The Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is used for a powerful reduction. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The saturated sec-butyl group and the stable aromatic ring will not be altered.\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Matching the Product to the Options**\n\nComparing our deduced final product with the choices provided:\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect.

This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) is due to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal (7.2 ppm) is due to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Analysis of the alkyl side chain:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is adjacent to the methyl group and also to another carbon.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3H indicates a different methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached directly to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton), which explains its downfield shift. It is coupled to the protons of both the methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. Connecting them at the methine and methylene carbons gives the structure -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on all the evidence, Compound X is a benzene ring substituted at the para positions with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent used for the complete reduction of various functional groups, including carboxylic acids, down to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).

Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region (typically 10-13 ppm) is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons *ortho* to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Region Signals:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2 hydrogens is likely a methylene group (-CH₂) coupled to multiple, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1 hydrogen is a methine group (-CH). Its downfield shift suggests it is benzylic (attached directly to the benzene ring).\n\n    Assembling these pieces, the signals correspond to a **sec-butyl** group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]. The methine proton (2.9 ppm) is attached to the ring, a methyl group (1.4 ppm), and a methylene group (1.7 ppm).

The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm is next to an alkyl group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent:\n        *   A multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH group attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   A multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n        *   A doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) indicates a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group.\n        *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) indicates a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n    *   Assembling these fragments—a CH, a CH₂, and two CH₃ groups—and considering their splitting patterns, the alkyl group is identified as a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n\nBased on this analysis, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI\n\nThe reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a strong reduction. This reagent combination is known to completely reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The general reaction is:\n\nR-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂\n\nIn this specific case, the 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced. The carboxylic acid functional group is converted to a methyl group, while the *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n\nThe correct final product is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak at `3400–2500 cm-1` is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at `1720 cm-1` corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1` indicate the presence of a C=C bond in an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   The remaining signals (`2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`) must describe the other substituent on the ring. Let's piece it together:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` is a -CH3 group next to a -CH2 group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` is a -CH2 group next to the -CH3 and a -CH group. This confirms an ethyl fragment (-CH2CH3).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` is a -CH3 group next to a -CH group.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is a -CH group attached to the benzene ring, the ethyl group, and the methyl group.\n        *   Assembling these fragments gives a `sec-butyl` group: -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3).\n    *   Conclusion from NMR: The compound has a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

In conjunction with the broad O-H band, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹:** This absorption suggests C=C stretching, which is characteristic of an aromatic ring.\n*   **1450 cm⁻¹:** This is within the region for C-H bending vibrations.\n\nThe IR data strongly indicate that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet at such a high chemical shift is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both appearing as doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, located at a chemical shift indicative of a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon attached to the benzene ring).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, likely a CH₂ group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, which must be a CH₃ group adjacent to a carbon with one proton (a CH group).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, indicating a CH₃ group next to a CH₂ group.\n\n**Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\nPutting the pieces together, the alkyl substituent is a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. The benzylic proton is the CH at 2.9 ppm. This CH is coupled to the adjacent CH₃ group (1.4 ppm, doublet) and the CH₂ group (1.7 ppm, multiplet).

The aromatic ring and the existing alkyl group will remain unaffected by these conditions.\n\n**Applying the Reaction to Compound X:**\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group at position 1 of the benzene ring is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged. The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Product to the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our predicted product with the choices:\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is *sec*-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. The carboxylic acid is reduced, not retained.\n*   C) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** Correct. This matches our predicted product.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\n### Identification of the Final Product\n\nTo determine the final product, we must first deduce the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from its spectral data and then identify the product of its reaction with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n#### Step 1: Structure Elucidation of Compound X\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n*   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n*   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can conclude that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded.\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂) situated between two different proton environments (e.g., a methyl and a methine group).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton suggests a methine group (-CH) bonded to the benzene ring and adjacent to multiple protons.\n\n**Assembling the Structure:**\nThe alkyl signals piece together to form a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]. This group is attached to the benzene ring at the methine carbon. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n#### Step 2: The Chemical Reaction\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is well-established that Red P and HI will completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction is a full reduction of the carboxyl group to an alkane.\n\n#### Step 3: Determining the Final Product\n\nThe reduction of the carboxylic acid group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will result in the formation of a methyl group, while the *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring remain intact.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nThis structure matches option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Compound X from the Spectral Data\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, using the provided infrared (IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) data.\n\n**IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\nThe IR data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Signals:** The remaining signals define the structure of the alkyl substituent.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, likely the benzylic proton (the one attached directly to the benzene ring).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, likely a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, indicating a -CH₃ group coupled to a single proton (-CH).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, characteristic of a -CH₃ group coupled to a -CH₂- group.\n\nAssembling these pieces, the alkyl group is a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). The proton at 2.9 ppm is the -CH, coupled to the adjacent -CH₃ (at 1.4 ppm) and -CH₂- (at 1.7 ppm).\n\nBased on the combined spectral data, **Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

This combination is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to alkanes. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Reaction:**\n    The -COOH group on the benzene ring of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring itself will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Product:** The -COOH is replaced by -CH₃, resulting in **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Step 3: Match the Product with the Options\n\nComparing our deduced product with the choices provided:\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl vs. sec-butyl).\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the spectral data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks indicate the presence of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, which is a broad singlet far downfield, is the classic chemical shift for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm):**\n        *   The two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) indicate a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n        *   The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n        *   The upfield doublet (7.2 ppm) corresponds to the protons *meta* to the carboxylic acid group (and *ortho* to the other substituent).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, 0.9 ppm):** Let's piece together the alkyl group attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).

This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a para- (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, likely a methine (CH) group attached directly to the benzene ring.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, likely a methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl (CH₃) group attached to a CH group.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl (CH₃) group attached to a CH₂ group.\n\nLet's assemble the alkyl substituent from the NMR fragments. The fragments are a -CH group, a -CH₂ group, a CH-CH₃ group, and a -CH₂-CH₃ group. The only way to combine these to form a single C₄H₉ alkyl group that fits all the splitting patterns is a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃].\n\n*   The **CH** at 2.9 ppm is attached to the ring, a methyl group, and a methylene group.\n*   The **CH₃** at 1.4 ppm is attached to the benzylic CH, creating a doublet.\n*   The **CH₂** at 1.7 ppm is adjacent to both the benzylic CH and the terminal methyl group, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n*   The terminal **CH₃** at 0.9 ppm is adjacent to the CH₂ group, creating a triplet.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which corresponds to option (A).\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction\n\nCompound X, identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\nThis combination of reagents (red P and HI) is a very powerful reducing agent.

The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which, in combination with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can confidently conclude that compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) data allows us to determine the precise structure of the molecule.\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very deshielded, broad singlet corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This supports the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring.\n*   **The Alkyl Chain Signals:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for a single proton, suggesting a CH group connected to several other protons.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, likely a CH₂ group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, which must be a CH₃ group next to a CH group.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, which must be a CH₃ group next to a CH₂ group.\n\nAssembling these alkyl fragments leads to a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This structure perfectly matches the splitting patterns and integrations observed.\n\nCombining all the spectral information, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 3: The Chemical Reaction**\n\nCompound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is well-established that red P and HI will reduce a carboxylic acid group completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\nThe carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to the benzene ring is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring itself are unaffected by these reagents.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 4: Matching with Options**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect structure.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product from the reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Analysis of Compound X\n\n**1. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data Analysis:**\n*   The broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can infer that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield shift to 8.0 ppm is caused by the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an alkyl substituent.\n*   **Alkyl Region Signals:** The remaining signals describe the structure of the alkyl group attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** This is likely a methine (-CH) proton directly attached to the benzene ring. Its chemical shift is downfield due to the deshielding effect of the aromatic ring.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** This indicates a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** This suggests a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n\n**3. Assembling the Structure of the Alkyl Group:**\nThe signals at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) are characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The signals at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) suggest a CH-CH₃ fragment where the CH is also bonded to the ethyl group and the benzene ring. This combination forms a *sec*-butyl group: `CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)-`.\n\nTherefore, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

This combination of reagents is known to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction involves the removal of both oxygen atoms from the carboxyl group and their replacement with hydrogen atoms. The red phosphorus helps to regenerate HI from the iodine (I₂) formed during the reaction, thus allowing the reduction to go to completion.\n\nApplying this to our starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the -COOH group will be reduced to a -CH₃ group, while the *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n\nThe final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\n*   **Analysis of the Starting Material (Compound X):**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectroscopy Data:**\n        *   The broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, specifically from a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3400–2500 cm-1 (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is typical for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, and its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1:** These peaks are indicative of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\nBased on the IR data, compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region (typically 10-13 ppm) is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons *ortho* to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Region Signals:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2 hydrogens is likely a methylene group (-CH₂) coupled to multiple, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1 hydrogen is a methine group (-CH).
