Reaction I starts with a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, while Reaction II starts with an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Creation of New Stereocenters:** Both reactions involve ketone reductions that generate new stereocenters. The stereochemical outcome depends on whether the original molecule was chiral or achiral.\n3.  **Products of Reaction I vs. Reaction II:** Reaction I produces diastereomers. Reaction II produces a meso compound and a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n4.  **Principles of HPLC Separation:** It is essential to distinguish between the capabilities of achiral (normal-phase) and chiral HPLC columns. An achiral column cannot separate enantiomers, whereas a chiral column can.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a single, pure enantiomer. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which remains unchanged.\n    *   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol. This creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   **Outcome:** Since a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the products are **diastereomers**. The two possible products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces a mixture of **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an **achiral** molecule because it has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   **Outcome:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, all possible stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol, are formed. There are three distinct stereoisomers:\n        *   A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are formed in a 1:1 ratio as a racemic mixture.\n        *   A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces **three distinct stereoisomers** (a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture:**\n    *   The total number of unique chemical compounds in the final mixture is the sum of the products from both reactions: 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 total unique stereoisomers**.\n\n4.  **Predict the HPLC Chromatograms:**\n    *   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):** This technique separates compounds with different physical properties. Diastereomers have different properties and can be separated, but enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together.\n        *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate, contributing **2 peaks**.\n        *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n        *   Therefore, the total number of peaks on the normal-phase column is 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase and is specifically designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n        *   Since the final mixture contains **5 unique stereoisomers**, the chiral column will resolve all of them (assuming sufficient column efficiency).\n        *   Therefore, the total number of peaks on the chiral column is **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical analysis concludes that the experiment will yield **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reactants and Reactions**: Correctly identify the starting materials' properties (chiral vs. achiral) and how the reactions create new stereocenters.\n2.  **Determine Products**: Use stereochemical rules to determine the number and type of stereoisomers produced in each reaction.\n3.  **Understand HPLC Principles**: Distinguish between the separation capabilities of achiral (normal-phase) and chiral HPLC columns.\n    *   Normal-phase separates based on physical properties (polarity), resolving diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n    *   Chiral-phase separates based on 3D shape, resolving all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n\n**1.

To solve this, we must first determine all the unique chemical compounds (stereoisomers) produced in each reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It is crucial to identify this as a **single, pure enantiomer**. It possesses a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone group at carbon C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This chemical transformation creates a **new stereocenter** at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: When a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the products formed are **diastereomers**. The two possible products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: The reaction produces a mixture of **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an **achiral** molecule because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄. This creates **two new stereocenters** at carbons C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, all possible stereoisomers are formed. Analyzing the symmetry of the product, pentane-2,4-diol, reveals three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.

This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: The reaction produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\n*   The final mixture contains all products from both reactions.\n*   The total number of unique chemical compounds (stereoisomers) is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique compounds**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It **can** separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated.

A consensus can be reached by examining the unanimous chemical reasoning provided in the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe core chemical reasoning is consistent across all candidate answers. The discrepancies arise only from incorrectly mapping the correct conclusion to the provided options (A, B, C, D). The correct chemical analysis is as follows:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The reaction starts with **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**. This is a crucial point: the reactant is a **single, pure enantiomer**. It has one pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a **new stereocenter** at C3, while the original stereocenter at C5 remains unaffected.\n*   **Outcome**: When a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the resulting products are **diastereomers**. The two possible products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: The reaction produces a mixture of **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The reaction starts with **pentane-2,4-dione**. This is an **achiral** molecule because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Excess NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Outcome**: Because the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, all possible stereoisomers are formed, resulting in a mixture that is, overall, optically inactive. The products are:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: The reaction produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\n*   The final mixture contains all the products from both reactions.\n*   Total number of unique stereoisomers = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique compounds**.\n\n**4. Predict the Chromatogram Peaks**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**:\n    *   **Principle**: An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It **can** separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   **Prediction**:\n        *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate, yielding **2 peaks**.\n        *   In the products from Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will separate from them. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as one peak. This also yields **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**:\n    *   **Principle**: A chiral column uses a chiral stationary phase and is specifically designed to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Prediction**: The final mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomeric compounds. An ideal chiral column will resolve all of them.\n    *   **Total Chiral Peaks = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will produce:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key points from the provided reasoning.\n\n### **Detailed Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of peaks observed when a combined product mixture is analyzed by two different HPLC methods. To solve this, we must first determine all the unique chemical compounds (stereoisomers) produced in each reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It is crucial to identify this as a **single, pure enantiomer**. It possesses a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction**: The ketone group at carbon C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This chemical transformation creates a **new stereocenter** at C3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: When a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the products formed are **diastereomers**. The two possible products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I**: The reaction produces a mixture of **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This is an **achiral** molecule because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄. This creates **two new stereocenters** at carbons C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome**: Since the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, all possible stereoisomers are formed. Analyzing the symmetry of the product, pentane-2,4-diol, reveals three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II**: The reaction produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\n*   The final mixture contains all products from both reactions.\n*   The total number of unique chemical compounds (stereoisomers) is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique compounds**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It **can** separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This contributes **2 peaks**.\n    *   From the products of Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated from them. However, the two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak (they co-elute). This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the enantiomeric pair).\n    *   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks**: 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase and is specifically designed to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n    *   The column can resolve every unique stereoisomer present in the mixture.\n    *   Since the mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers, the chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks** (assuming sufficient resolution).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

It is crucial to identify this as a **chiral molecule** provided as a **single, pure enantiomer**. It possesses a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which is unaffected by the reaction.\n2.  **Reaction**: The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a **new stereocenter** at C3.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: When a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the resulting products are **diastereomers**. The two products formed are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Conclusion**: Reaction I produces a mixture of **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: The reactant is `pentane-2,4-dione`. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore **achiral**.\n2.  **Reaction**: Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating **two new stereocenters**.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: Because the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, the reaction produces all possible stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol.

The two enantiomers, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will elute together (co-elute). This contributes **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting racemic pair).\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks**: The products of the two reactions have different molecular formulas (C7 vs. C5) and are thus structurally distinct constitutional isomers, ensuring they do not co-elute. Therefore, the total is 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle**: A chiral column uses a chiral stationary phase and is designed to resolve all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction**: The chiral column will interact differently with each of the **5 unique stereoisomers** present in the mixture.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks**: Assuming the column is effective, it will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the chemical principles:\n*   The **chiral HPLC** will show **5 peaks**.\n*   The **normal-phase HPLC** will show **4 peaks**.\n\nThis outcome matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers and verifying the underlying chemical principles.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is `(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one`. It is crucial to identify this as a **chiral molecule** provided as a **single, pure enantiomer**. It has one existing stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This chemical transformation creates a **new stereocenter** at C3. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** When a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the products formed are **diastereomers**. The two possible products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The reaction produces a mixture of **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n**2. Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is `pentane-2,4-dione`. This is an **achiral molecule** because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄. This creates **two new stereocenters**, one at C2 and one at C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Starting from an achiral, symmetrical molecule, the reaction will produce all possible stereoisomers. This results in three distinct compounds:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to its internal symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n**3. Determine the total number of unique products in the final mixture.**\n*   The final mixture is created by combining the products from both reactions.\n*   Total number of unique stereoisomers = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique compounds**.\n\n**4. Predict the chromatogram for Normal-Phase HPLC (achiral column).**\n*   **Principle:** An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It **can** separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Application:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   From the products of Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**5. Predict the chromatogram for Chiral HPLC.**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. It is specifically designed to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Application:** The total mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers. An ideal chiral column will resolve all of them.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\n*   A) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   B) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n*   C) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   D) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided agents' responses.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reactant Chirality is Key:** The stereochemical outcome of a reaction is highly dependent on whether the starting material is chiral or achiral.\n    *   **Reaction I:** The starting material, `(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one`, is a **single, pure enantiomer**. It is already chiral.\n    *   **Reaction II:** The starting material, `pentane-2,4-dione`, is **achiral** because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n\n2.  **Formation of Stereoisomers:**\n    *   **Reaction I:** A new stereocenter is created at carbon C3 by the reduction of the ketone. Since the molecule is already chiral at C5, this reaction results in the formation of **two diastereomers**: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   **Reaction II:** Two new stereocenters are created at carbons C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral and symmetrical, the reaction produces all possible stereoisomers. This results in **three unique products**: one pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and one meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol).\n\n3.  **Total Number of Unique Compounds:** The combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of 2 compounds from Reaction I and 3 compounds from Reaction II, for a grand total of **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n4.  **Principles of HPLC Separation:**\n    *   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):** This method separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate diastereomers (which have different physical properties) but **cannot** resolve a pair of enantiomers (which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment).\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase to interact differently with each enantiomer, allowing for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Products from Reaction I:** 2 diastereomers.\n2.  **Products from Reaction II:** 3 stereoisomers (one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers).\n3.  **Total Compounds:** 5 unique stereoisomers in the combined final mixture.\n\n4.  **Prediction for Normal-Phase HPLC (achiral column):**\n    *   The 2 diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. The two enantiomers, however, have identical properties and will co-elute (elute as one peak). -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   Since the products of the two reactions have different molecular formulas and structures, they will be separated from each other.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Prediction for Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column is designed to separate all unique stereoisomers.\n    *   The mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    *   Total Peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical analysis consistently and unanimously concludes that the chemist will observe:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 Peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis result directly corresponds to option C in the provided question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, based on fundamental principles of stereochemistry and chromatography.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Products**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** The reaction starts with `(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one`. This is a crucial detail: the starting material is a **single, pure enantiomer**. It has a pre-existing stereocenter at carbon C5, which remains unchanged throughout the reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at carbon C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol. This process creates a **new stereocenter** at C3.\n*   **Outcome:** When a new stereocenter is created in a molecule that is already chiral, the products formed are **diastereomers**. The two possible products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** This reaction produces a mixture of **2 distinct compounds (diastereomers)**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** The reaction starts with `pentane-2,4-dione`. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore **achiral**.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at carbons C2 and C4.\n*   **Outcome:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product (pentane-2,4-diol) are formed. There are three possibilities:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  A **meso compound**: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** This reaction produces a mixture of **3 distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Total Number of Products**\n*   The products from both reactions are combined. The total number of unique stereoisomeric compounds is the sum of the products from each reaction.\n*   Total compounds = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Analysis of the HPLC Separation**\n\n**Careful Point 4: Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It **can** separate diastereomers (which have different physical properties) but **cannot** separate enantiomers (which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment).\n*   **Prediction:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From the three products of Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will be separated from them. The two enantiomers will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is specifically designed to create a chiral environment. This allows it to interact differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Prediction:**\n    *   The final mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomeric compounds.\n    *   The chiral column is designed to resolve all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   Number of peaks in **chiral HPLC**: 5\n*   Number of peaks in **normal-phase HPLC**: 4\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\n*   A) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n*   B) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   C) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   D) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
