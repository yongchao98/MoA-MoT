They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2.

This requires applying two fundamental principles from astrophysics: the formula for geometric transit probability and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **State the Core Physical Principles**\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the probability that it will be observed to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n        $p = R_s / a$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital properties (`a` and `P`) to its host star's mass (`M_s`). For a planet with a mass that is negligible compared to its star, the law can be written as a proportionality:\n        $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2 \\implies a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    To compare the two planets, we create a ratio of their transit probabilities, `p1 / p2`:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify**\n    The problem provides the following crucial facts:\n    *   Stellar Radii: `R_s1 = R_s2` (both host stars have the same radii).\n    *   Stellar Masses: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` (the star of Planet_1 is twice as massive).\n    *   Orbital Periods: `P1 = P2 / 3` (Planet_1's period is three times shorter), which means `P2 = 3 * P1`.\n\n    ***Careful Point 1: The Role of Equal Radii.*** The fact that `R_s1 = R_s2` is a critical simplification. It means the ratio `(R_s1 / R_s2)` is equal to 1. The equation for the probability ratio simplifies to depend only on the orbital sizes:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n    This shows that the ratio of transit probabilities is the *inverse* of the ratio of the semi-major axes. The planet with the smaller orbit (smaller `a`) will have a higher transit probability.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law, we can calculate the ratio `a2 / a1` in terms of the given parameters:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n    ***Careful Point 2: Correct Substitution.*** It is essential to substitute the relationships for mass and period into the correct positions in the fraction.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression**\n    We now simplify the expression inside the parentheses.\n\n    ***Careful Point 3: Algebraic Accuracy.*** A common error is to forget to square the coefficient along with the variable. The term `(3 * P1)^2` correctly expands to `9 * P1^2`.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms `M_s2` and `P1^2` cancel from the numerator and denominator, leaving:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    The numerical value of the cube root of 4.5 is approximately `1.65`.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion and Answer Selection**\n    From our earlier steps, we established that `p1 / p2 = a2 / a1`. Therefore, the final probability ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n    ***Careful Point 4: Interpretation of the Result.*** Since the ratio `p1 / p2` is greater than 1, the probability of Planet_1 transiting is higher. Specifically, its probability is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. The researchers should therefore prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\nNow, we match this robustly derived conclusion to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n*   B) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n*   C) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n*   D) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOur conclusion perfectly matches the statement in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate agents and highlighting crucial points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Physical Principles**\nThe objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets (Planet_1 and Planet_2) to determine which is a more favorable target for observation and by what factor. The solution is based on two fundamental principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability that it will transit its star from our vantage point is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$).\n    $p_{tr} = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) and semi-major axis ($a$) to the mass of its host star ($M_s$). For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star's, the relationship can be expressed as a proportionality:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which can be rearranged as $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$.\n\n**2. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Probabilities**\nTo compare the two planets, we set up the ratio of their transit probabilities, $p_1 / p_2$:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\nThe problem provides key information that simplifies this expression:\n*   \"both host stars have the same radii\" $\\implies R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n*   \"The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\" $\\implies M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n*   \"the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2\" $\\implies P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which is equivalent to $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Simplification due to Equal Radii**\nSince the stellar radii are equal, the ratio $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ becomes 1. This is a critical simplification identified correctly by nearly all candidate answers. The equation reduces to show that the probability ratio is simply the *inverse* of the semi-major axis ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\nThis implies that the planet with the smaller orbit (smaller $a$) will have the higher transit probability.\n\n**3. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law, we express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of the known parameters:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n**Careful Point 2: Correct Substitution**\nIt is essential to substitute the mass and period relationships correctly. We replace $M_{s1}$ in the denominator with $2 M_{s2}$ and $P_2$ in the numerator with $3 P_1$:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n**4. Solve the Expression Algebraically**\nWe now simplify the expression inside the cube root.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Squaring the Coefficient**\nA common algebraic error is to forget to square the coefficient along with the variable. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ becomes $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel from the numerator and denominator, leaving a simple numerical ratio:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n**5. Final Calculation and Conclusion**\nThe numerical value of $(4.5)^{1/3}$ is approximately **1.65**.\nSince we established in Step 2 that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$, it follows that:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n\n**Careful Point 4: Correct Interpretation of the Final Ratio**\nThe ratio is greater than 1, which means the numerator ($p_1$) is larger than the denominator ($p_2$). Therefore, the transit probability for **Planet_1** is approximately **1.65 times higher** than that of Planet_2. This makes Planet_1 the preferred target for observation.\n\nNow, we match this conclusion to the original multiple-choice options:\nA) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect planet and factor)\nB) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect factor)\nC) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect planet and factor)\nD) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (**Correct planet and factor**)\n\nThe analysis robustly supports the statement in option D. The wide variation in the letter choice among the candidate answers likely resulted from them being presented with a randomized ordering of the options, but their underlying mathematical reasoning is almost unanimously correct and converges on this same result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate solutions and a rigorous application of the relevant physics.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Principles**\n    The main objective is to determine which of two exoplanets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher geometric probability of transiting its host star, and to quantify this difference. The solution depends on two fundamental concepts in astrophysics:\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability that it will be observed to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n        $p = R_s / a$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital characteristics to its host star's mass. For a planet whose mass is negligible compared to its star's (a valid assumption for Earth-like planets), the law can be expressed as a proportionality: $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$. This can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis: $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Comparison**\n    To compare the two planets, we take the ratio of their transit probabilities, `p₁ / p₂`:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify**\n    The problem states:\n    *   $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$ (The host stars have the same radii).\n    *   $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$ (Planet_1's star is twice as massive).\n    *   $P_1 = P_2 / 3$ (Planet_1's period is three times shorter, meaning $P_2 = 3 P_1$).\n\n    The first piece of information ($R_{s1} = R_{s2}$) simplifies the probability ratio significantly, as the term $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ becomes 1. This reduces the problem to:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Ratio of Orbital Sizes**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's Law, we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes as:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    Now, we substitute the relationships for mass and period:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression**\n    We simplify the expression inside the parentheses. The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel out.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9 \\cdot P_1^2}{2 \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Calculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n    $$ (4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096 $$\n    So, the ratio is approximately 1.65.\n\n7.  **Draw the Final Conclusion**\n    We found that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\approx 1.65$. Since this ratio is greater than 1, the transit probability of Planet_1 ($p_1$) is higher than that of Planet_2 ($p_2$). The concluding statement is: **Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**\n\n### **Careful Points**\nThis problem has several potential points of error, all of which the candidate agents correctly navigated in their derivations:\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Simplification.** It is crucial to use the fact that the stellar radii are equal ($R_{s1} = R_{s2}$) to simplify the probability ratio.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Inverse Relationship.** One must correctly establish that the probability ratio ($p_1/p_2$) is equal to the *inverse* of the semi-major axis ratio ($a_2/a_1$), meaning the planet with the smaller orbit has the higher probability.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Correct Substitution.** The mass and period relationships ($M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$ and $P_2 = 3 P_1$) must be substituted into the correct positions (numerator/denominator) within the Kepler's Law ratio.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Algebraic Accuracy.** A very common algebraic mistake is forgetting to square the coefficient along with the variable. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ must be expanded to $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Interpretation.** The final ratio of ~1.65 must be correctly interpreted as Planet_1 having the higher probability, as it corresponds to the numerator in the $p_1/p_2$ ratio.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe step-by-step derivation robustly shows that \"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\" Comparing this result to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n*   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n*   C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n*   D) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n\nThe derived conclusion perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers and identifying all crucial points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Physics**\n\nThe objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 ($p_1$) and Planet_2 ($p_2$), to decide which is the better observation target and by what factor. The solution is based on two fundamental principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability it will transit its star from our viewpoint is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$).\n    $p_{tr} = R_s / a$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital characteristics to its host star. For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star, the relationship between the semi-major axis ($a$), orbital period ($P$), and stellar mass ($M_s$) is given by the proportionality:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2 \\implies a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Ratio:** To compare the planets, we create a ratio of their transit probabilities:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n    *   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n    *   Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which means $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n    **Careful Point 1: Importance of Equal Radii.** The fact that the stellar radii are equal is a critical simplification. It means the term $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ equals 1. The equation for the probability ratio reduces to:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n    This shows the transit probability is inversely proportional to the orbital distance; the planet with the smaller orbit has a higher chance to transit.\n\n3.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We use Kepler's Third Law to express the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ in terms of the known parameters:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now we substitute the relationships for mass and period.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    **Careful Point 2: Correct Algebraic Expansion.** A common error is to forget to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ correctly expands to $9 P_1^2$.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel out, leaving a simple numerical fraction:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Calculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n    $$ (4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65 $$\n\n### **3.

This requires applying fundamental principles of exoplanet detection.\n\n### **Step-by-step Derivation**\n\n1.  **State the Core Physical Principles**\n    The solution relies on two key physical laws:\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability that it will be seen to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`). A planet with a smaller orbit is more likely to transit.\n        $p = R_s / a$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital properties (`a` and period `P`) to its host star's mass (`M_s`). For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star's (a valid assumption here), the law can be written as a proportionality:\n        $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which can be rearranged to solve for `a`: $a \\propto (M_s P^2)^{1/3}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    To compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting (`p_1`) to that of Planet_2 (`p_2`):\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} $$\n    This can be algebraically rearranged to separate the terms:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify**\n    The problem provides several key relationships:\n    *   **Stellar Radii:** The host stars have the same radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n    *   **Stellar Masses:** The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n    *   **Orbital Periods:** The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which implies $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n    **Careful Point 1: Equal Stellar Radii.** This is a critical simplification. Since $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, the ratio $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ is equal to 1. The probability ratio now becomes solely dependent on the inverse of the semi-major axes ratio.\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes using Kepler's Law**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's Law, we can calculate the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} P_2^2}{M_{s1} P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    **Careful Point 2: Correct Substitution.** It is essential to substitute the mass and period relationships into the correct positions.

To do this, we need to use the physical principles governing planetary transits.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability it will transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$).\n        $p_{tr} = R_s / a$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's semi-major axis ($a$), its orbital period ($P$), and its host star's mass ($M_s$). Assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's, we can use the proportionality:\n        $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which rearranges to $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities:**\n    To compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, $p_1 / p_2$.\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify:**\n    The problem provides key relationships:\n    *   Stellar Radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$ (\"both host stars have the same radii\").\n    *   Stellar Masses: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$ (\"star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\").\n    *   Orbital Periods: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$ (\"orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter\"). This is equivalent to $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n    **Careful Point 1: Simplifying with Radii.** Since the stellar radii are equal, the ratio $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ is 1. This is a critical simplification. The probability ratio now becomes the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes:**\n    We use the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    **Careful Point 2: Correct Substitution.** It is crucial to substitute the mass and period relationships correctly into the numerator and denominator. We replace $M_{s1}$ with $2 M_{s2}$ and $P_2$ with $3 P_1$.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression:**\n    Now we simplify the algebraic expression inside the parentheses.\n    **Careful Point 3: Algebraic Accuracy.** A common mistake is to forget to square the coefficient '3' along with the variable $P_1$. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ becomes $9 P_1^2$.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel out, leaving a simple fraction:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n    Calculating the numerical value gives $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65$.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion and Answer Selection:**\n    We established in step 3 that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. Therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n    **Careful Point 4: Correct Interpretation.** Since the ratio is greater than 1, the probability of Planet_1 transiting ($p_1$) is greater than that of Planet_2 ($p_2$). Specifically, Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times more likely to transit. The researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\nMatching this robust conclusion to the options provided in the question:\nA) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOur conclusion perfectly matches the statement in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting critical points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **1. Identify the Physical Principles and Goal**\n\nThe central task is to compare the geometric transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 ($p_1$) and Planet_2 ($p_2$), to determine which is the more likely transit candidate and by what factor. The solution hinges on two fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet with a circular orbit viewed from a random angle, the probability that it will be seen to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$). A planet in a closer orbit or orbiting a larger star has a higher probability.\n    $p_{tr} = R_s / a$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital properties ($a$, $P$) to its host star's mass ($M_s$). Assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to its star's, the law can be expressed as a proportionality:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which can be rearranged as $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n### **2. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Probabilities**\n\nTo compare the planets, we create a ratio of their transit probabilities, $p_1/p_2$:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that \"both host stars have the same radii\", so $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The role of equal stellar radii.** This is a critical simplification. Since $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, the ratio $\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}$ becomes 1. This reduces the probability comparison to a simple inverse relationship with the orbital distances:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\nThis tells us that the planet with the smaller orbit (smaller $a$) will have the higher transit probability.\n\n### **3. Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Ratio of Orbital Sizes**\n\nFrom the proportionality derived from Kepler's Law, $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$, we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes as:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nWe now substitute the remaining relationships given in the problem:\n*   Mass relationship: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$\n*   Period relationship: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which is equivalent to $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Correct substitution.** It is crucial to substitute these relationships into the correct positions (i.e., numerator vs. denominator) in the fraction.\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n### **4. Solve the Expression**\n\nNow we simplify the algebraic expression inside the parentheses.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Squaring the coefficient.** A common algebraic mistake is to forget to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ must be expanded to $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel from the numerator and denominator, leaving a simple fraction:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n### **5. Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nCalculating the final numerical value yields:\n$$ (4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096 $$\nFrom Step 2, we know that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n\n**Careful Point 4: Correct interpretation of the result.** Since the ratio $p_1 / p_2$ is approximately 1.65 (a value greater than 1), it means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is greater than that of Planet_2. Specifically, it is **~1.65 times higher**. Consequently, the researchers should prefer to observe **Planet_1**.\n\nWe now match this final conclusion to the provided options:\nA) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.

The solution requires applying the principles of geometric transit probability and Kepler's Third Law.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **State the Core Physical Principles**\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability that it will be seen to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$).\n        $p_{tr} = R_s / a$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$), its semi-major axis ($a$), and the mass of its host star ($M_s$). For a planet with a mass that is negligible compared to its star, the law can be expressed as a proportionality:\n        $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$\n        or, solving for the semi-major axis:\n        $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    To compare the two planets, we create a ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting ($p_1$) to that of Planet_2 ($p_2$):\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify**\n    The problem provides the following crucial information:\n    *   Stellar Radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$ (both host stars have the same radii).\n    *   Stellar Masses: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$ (Planet_1's star is twice as massive).\n    *   Orbital Periods: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which means $P_2 = 3 P_1$ (Planet_1's period is three times shorter).\n\n    **Careful Point 1: Use the Equality of Radii.** Since $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, the first term in our ratio, $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$, is equal to 1. This is a critical simplification. The probability ratio now depends only on the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n    This means the planet with the smaller orbit (smaller $a$) will have the higher transit probability.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law, we can write the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n    **Careful Point 2: Substitute Correctly.** It is essential to substitute the mass and period relationships into the correct positions. We replace $M_{s1}$ in the denominator with $2M_{s2}$ and $P_2$ in the numerator with $3P_1$:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression**\n    Now, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses.\n\n    **Careful Point 3: Handle Exponents Properly.** A common algebraic mistake is to forget to square the coefficient along with the variable. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ correctly becomes $9 P_1^2$.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel from the numerator and denominator, leaving a simple numerical fraction:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Calculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n    $$ (4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096... \\approx 1.65 $$\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion and Answer Selection**\n    From Step 3, we know that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. Therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n    **Careful Point 4: Interpret the Final Ratio.** Since the ratio is greater than 1, the numerator ($p_1$) is larger than the denominator ($p_2$). This means the probability of **Planet_1** transiting is higher. Specifically, it is **~1.65 times higher** than the probability for Planet_2.

The widespread disagreement on the final letter among the candidate answers, despite their near-unanimous correct calculations, was likely due to a randomized ordering of options. The physics and mathematics robustly support this one result.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided agents' responses.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem and Physical Principles**\n\nThe core task is to compare the geometric transit probabilities ($p$) of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to determine which is the better observation target and by what factor. The analysis relies on two fundamental concepts in astrophysics, which were correctly identified by all valid candidate answers.\n\n*   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability of it transiting its star is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$). A planet closer to its star (smaller $a$) has a higher transit probability.\n    $p_{tr} = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital characteristics to its host star's properties. For a planet with a mass negligible compared to its star, the law is expressed as a proportionality: $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_s}$. Rearranging to solve for the semi-major axis gives:\n    $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n### **2. Formulation and Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\nTo compare the two planets, we formulate the ratio of their transit probabilities, $\\frac{p_1}{p_2}$:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the information given in the problem:\n*   Stellar Radii: \"both host stars have the same radii\" $\\implies R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n*   Stellar Masses: \"The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\" $\\implies M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n*   Orbital Periods: \"the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2\" $\\implies P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which can be written as $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Simplify using the Radii.** Since $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, the first term of the ratio $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ becomes 1. This is a crucial simplification and reduces the problem to comparing the orbital distances:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Express Orbital Distance using Kepler's Law.** We now substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Substitute Mass and Period Relationships.** We carefully substitute the known mass and period relationships into the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Correctly Perform the Algebra.** A common algebraic pitfall is forgetting to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ correctly becomes $9 P_1^2$.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel out, leaving a simple numerical fraction:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Calculate the Final Value.** The numerical value, confirmed by code executions across multiple agents, is:\n    $$(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65$$\n\n### **3. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe final step is to interpret this result. We found that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65$. Since this ratio is greater than 1, the probability of Planet_1 transiting ($p_1$) is greater than that of Planet_2 ($p_2$). The final conclusion is: **Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**\n\nWe now match this result to the original list of options provided in the question:\nA) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOur conclusion perfectly matches option D. The variation in the final letter choices among the candidate answers is due to them being presented with differently ordered multiple-choice lists, but the underlying physical reasoning and numerical calculation are unanimously correct and support this answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all careful points to ensure an accurate conclusion.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe goal is to determine which of two exoplanets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star and to quantify the factor by which that probability is higher. This requires combining the formula for geometric transit probability with Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **State the Governing Physical Principles**\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the probability it will transit is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n      $p = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For a planet with a mass that is negligible compared to its star (a valid assumption here), the law can be expressed as a proportionality:\n      $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis: $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    To compare the two planets, we find the ratio of their probabilities, $\\frac{p_1}{p_2}$:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify**\n    The problem provides the following key relationships:\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n    *   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which implies $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n    **Careful Point 1: The Role of Stellar Radii.** This is a critical simplification. Since $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, the ratio $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ is equal to 1. The probability ratio therefore simplifies to the inverse of the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n    This makes intuitive sense: for a given star size, a planet with a closer orbit (smaller `a`) has a higher chance of transiting.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's law, we can express the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ in terms of the known mass and period relationships.\n\n    **Careful Point 2: Correct Substitution.** It is essential to substitute the relationships into the correct positions in the formula. We replace $M_{s1}$ in the denominator with $2 M_{s2}$ and $P_2$ in the numerator with $3 P_1$:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression**\n    We now simplify the expression inside the parentheses.\n\n    **Careful Point 3: Algebraic Accuracy.** A common mistake is to forget to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ correctly becomes $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel from the numerator and denominator, leaving:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n    Calculating the numerical value gives $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65$. Since we established in Step 3 that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$, our final probability ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n\n    **Careful Point 4: Correct Interpretation.** The final step is to interpret this result correctly. Because the ratio $\\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ is approximately 1.65 (a value greater than 1), it means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is ~1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

State the Goal and Identify the Physical Principles**\nThe objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 ($p_1$) and Planet_2 ($p_2$), to determine which is the more likely target and by what factor. The solution is based on two fundamental principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet with a circular orbit, the probability that it transits its star as seen from a random vantage point is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$).\n    $p_{tr} = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital characteristics to its host star. For a planet with a mass negligible compared to its star's, the law can be expressed as a proportionality:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis: $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities**\nTo compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of their probabilities, $\\frac{p_1}{p_2}$:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1} / a_1}{R_{s2} / a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n**3. Apply Given Information and Simplify**\nThe problem states that \"both host stars have the same radii,\" which means $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\nThis allows for a crucial simplification, as the term $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ equals 1. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Kepler's Law, we can express the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ in terms of the known parameters:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nWe now substitute the remaining relationships given in the problem:\n*   Mass of star 1 is twice that of star 2: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n*   Period of planet 1 is three times shorter than planet 2: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which implies $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n**5. Simplify and Solve**\nThe expression simplifies algebraically:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot P_1^2}{2 \\cdot M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel, leaving a simple numerical ratio:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65 $$\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\nSince we established in Step 3 that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$, it follows that:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\nBecause the ratio is greater than 1, the probability of Planet_1 transiting ($p_1$) is higher than that of Planet_2 ($p_2$). Specifically, it is approximately 1.65 times higher. Therefore, **Planet_1 is the preferred target.**\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Inverse Relationship:** With equal stellar radii, the transit probability ($p$) is inversely proportional to the orbital semi-major axis ($a$). A smaller orbit means a higher probability.\n2.  **Correct Substitution:** It is crucial to substitute the mass ($M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}$) and period ($P_2 = 3P_1$) relationships into the correct positions in the ratio for Kepler's Law.\n3.  **Algebraic Accuracy:** A common error is to forget to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ correctly becomes $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n4.  **Interpreting the Final Ratio:** A final ratio of $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65$ means Planet_1's probability is 1.65 times that of Planet_2's.\n\nMatching the conclusion **\"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit\"** to the original options:\n\nA) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n\nThe result from the unanimous physical reasoning of the candidate answers perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe code execution confirms the numerical result of the calculation.\n\n**Analysis Path:**\n1.  **Ratio of Probabilities:** The ratio of transit probabilities `p_1 / p_2` simplifies to the inverse ratio of the semi-major axes, `a_2 / a_1`, because the stellar radii are identical (`R_s1 = R_s2`).\n2.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using Kepler's Third Law, the ratio `a_2 / a_1` is derived as `( (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) )^(1/3)`.\n3.  **Substitution:** We substitute the given values `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` and `P_2 = 3 * P_1` into the equation.\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = ( (M_s2 * (3*P_1)^2) / (2*M_s2 * P_1^2) )^(1/3)`\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = ( (9 * M_s2 * P_1^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1^2) )^(1/3)`\n4.  **Simplification:** The terms `M_s2` and `P_1^2` cancel out, leaving:\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:** The code output provides the value for this expression: `1.6509636244473134`. This is approximately `1.65`.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since `p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`, we have `p_1 / p_2 ≈ 1.65`. This means the transit probability for **Planet_1** is approximately **1.65 times higher** than for Planet_2.\n7.  **Match to Options:** We compare this conclusion to the given choices:\n    *   **A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.** (This matches our result perfectly.)\n    *   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n    *   C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n    *   D) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n\nThe code execution confirms the numerical calculation, leading directly to the correct option.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers and identifying all careful points to ensure an accurate conclusion.\n\n### **1. Identify the Goal and Governing Principles**\n\nThe objective is to determine which of two exoplanets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher geometric probability of transiting its host star and to quantify the ratio of their probabilities. The solution relies on two fundamental principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet with a circular orbit viewed at a random inclination, the probability that it will be seen to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    $p = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star's, the law can be expressed as a proportionality:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2 \\implies a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n### **2. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Probabilities**\n\nTo compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, `p1 / p2`:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that \"both host stars have the same radii,\" which means $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** This equality of radii is a crucial piece of information. It simplifies the first term of the ratio, $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$, to 1. The equation now shows that the ratio of transit probabilities is simply the *inverse* of the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\nThis means the planet with a closer orbit (smaller `a`) has a higher chance of crossing its star's disk from our point of view.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nUsing the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law, we can express the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nWe now substitute the known relationships from the problem statement:\n*   $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$ (The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive).\n*   $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which means $P_2 = 3 P_1$ (Planet_1's period is three times shorter).\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Meticulous substitution is essential. We replace $M_{s1}$ in the denominator with $2 M_{s2}$ and $P_2$ in the numerator with $3 P_1$.\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n### **4. Solve the Expression**\n\nNow we simplify the algebraic expression.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** A common algebraic error is to forget to square the coefficient along with the variable. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ becomes $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel out, leaving a simple numerical fraction:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\nCalculating the numerical value gives:\n$$ (4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096 $$\nSo, the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ is approximately 1.65.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nSince we found that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$, it follows that:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n**Careful Point 4:** We must correctly interpret this result. Since the ratio is greater than 1, the probability of **Planet_1** transiting is higher. Specifically, it is **~1.65 times higher** than that of Planet_2. Therefore, researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the provided options:\n\nA) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOur conclusion perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, a consistent step-by-step derivation emerges, which I will synthesize below. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates appear to be caused by different randomizations of the multiple-choice options, but the underlying physical reasoning and calculation are in unanimous agreement.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles**\n    The problem requires comparing the transit probabilities of two exoplanets. The solution is built on two fundamental concepts:\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet on a circular orbit, its probability of transiting is the ratio of its host star's radius (`R_s`) to its own orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n      $p = R_s / a$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital properties (period `P` and semi-major axis `a`) to the mass of its host star (`M_s`). For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star, the law can be written as a proportionality:\n      $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which can be rearranged as $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n2.  **Formulate and Simplify the Comparison**\n    To compare Planet_1 and Planet_2, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, `p₁/p₂`:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Incorporate the Given Information**\n    We use the facts provided in the problem to substitute into the equation:\n    *   Host stars have the same radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n    *   Host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n    *   Period of Planet_1 is three times shorter: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which means $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    The fact that the stellar radii are equal ($R_{s1} = R_{s2}$) is a crucial simplification. The term $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ becomes 1, so the probability ratio depends only on the orbital sizes:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's Law, we can write the ratio `a₂/a₁`:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    Now, we substitute the relationships for mass and period:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Solve the Expression Algebraically**\n    We simplify the expression inside the parentheses. A critical step here is to remember to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel out, leaving a simple fraction:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n7.  **Final Numerical Calculation and Conclusion**\n    Calculating the value gives $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65$. Since we found that `p₁/p₂ = a₂/a₁`, we have:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n    This result means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, researchers should prefer to observe **Planet_1**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Point 1: Simplification with Equal Radii.** Recognizing that equal stellar radii mean the probability ratio `p₁/p₂` is the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio `a₂/a₁` is a key step.\n*   **Point 2: Correct Kepler's Law Application.** It is essential to correctly set up the ratio using Kepler's Third Law, `a ∝ (M_s P²)^(1/3)`.\n*   **Point 3: Meticulous Substitution.** The indices (1 vs. 2) for mass and period must be correctly placed in the numerator and denominator of the ratio.\n*   **Point 4: Algebraic Accuracy.** A common pitfall is forgetting to square the coefficient for the period, i.e., using a factor of 3 instead of $3^2=9$.\n*   **Point 5: Final Interpretation.** The ratio `p₁/p₂ ≈ 1.65` is greater than 1, confirming that `p₁` is the larger probability. The factor is ~1.65.\n\nMatching our conclusion, **\"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit\"**, to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**\n*   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n*   C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n*   D) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n\nThe result from the unanimous physical reasoning perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all careful points to ensure an accurate conclusion.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core task is to determine which of two exoplanets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher geometric probability of transiting its host star and to calculate the factor by which its probability is higher. This requires a two-part physical model: the formula for transit probability and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles**\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet with a circular orbit viewed at a random inclination, the probability that it will be seen to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n        $p = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star's, the law can be expressed as a proportionality:\n        $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2 \\implies a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n2.  **Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    To compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, `p_1 / p_2`:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Identify Careful Points**\n    The problem provides the following relationships:\n    *   `R_s1 = R_s2` (both host stars have the same radii)\n    *   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` (the star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive)\n    *   `P_1 = P_2 / 3`, which means `P_2 = 3 * P_1` (Planet_1's period is three times shorter)\n\n    **Careful Point 1: Use the simplification from equal stellar radii.**\n    The fact that `R_s1 = R_s2` is a crucial piece of information. It simplifies the ratio of the stellar radii, `(R_s1 / R_s2)`, to 1. The probability ratio now becomes solely dependent on the inverse of the semi-major axes ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n    This makes intuitive sense: a planet with a closer orbit (smaller `a`) has a higher chance of crossing its star's disk from our point of view.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes using Kepler's Law**\n    From the proportionality $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$, we can express the ratio `a₂ / a₁`:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    **Careful Point 2: Be meticulous with substitution.**\n    It is essential to substitute the relationships for mass and period correctly, ensuring the indices (1 and 2) are not mixed up. We substitute `M_s1` in the denominator with `2*M_s2`, and `P_2` in the numerator with `3*P_1`.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression**\n    Now we simplify the algebraic expression.\n\n    **Careful Point 3: Remember to square the period coefficient.**\n    A common algebraic error is to forget to square the '3' in the `(3*P₁)²` term. This must evaluate to `9 * P₁²`, not `3 * P₁²`.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms `M_s2` and `P_1^2` cancel out, leaving a simple numerical fraction:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n    Calculating the numerical value gives `~1.65`.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion and Answer Selection**\n    From our earlier steps, we established that `p₁ / p₂ = a₂ / a₁`. Therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n    **Careful Point 4: Interpret the final ratio correctly.**\n    Since the ratio `p₁ / p₂` is `~1.65` (a value greater than 1), it means the probability of Planet_1 transiting (`p_1`) is `~1.65` times higher than that of Planet_2 (`p_2`). Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis leads to the statement: **\"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\"**\n\nComparing this conclusion to the multiple-choice options in the question:\nA) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOur result exactly matches option D.

For a planet with a mass that is negligible compared to its star, the law can be written as a proportionality:\n        $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2 \\implies a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    To compare the two planets, we create a ratio of their transit probabilities, `p1 / p2`:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify**\n    The problem provides the following crucial facts:\n    *   Stellar Radii: `R_s1 = R_s2` (both host stars have the same radii).\n    *   Stellar Masses: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` (the star of Planet_1 is twice as massive).\n    *   Orbital Periods: `P1 = P2 / 3` (Planet_1's period is three times shorter), which means `P2 = 3 * P1`.\n\n    ***Careful Point 1: The Role of Equal Radii.*** The fact that `R_s1 = R_s2` is a critical simplification. It means the ratio `(R_s1 / R_s2)` is equal to 1. The equation for the probability ratio simplifies to depend only on the orbital sizes:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n    This shows that the ratio of transit probabilities is the *inverse* of the ratio of the semi-major axes. The planet with the smaller orbit (smaller `a`) will have a higher transit probability.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law, we can calculate the ratio `a2 / a1` in terms of the given parameters:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n    ***Careful Point 2: Correct Substitution.*** It is essential to substitute the relationships for mass and period into the correct positions in the fraction.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression**\n    We now simplify the expression inside the parentheses.\n\n    ***Careful Point 3: Algebraic Accuracy.*** A common error is to forget to square the coefficient along with the variable. The term `(3 * P1)^2` correctly expands to `9 * P1^2`.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms `M_s2` and `P1^2` cancel from the numerator and denominator, leaving:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    The numerical value of the cube root of 4.5 is approximately `1.65`.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion and Answer Selection**\n    From our earlier steps, we established that `p1 / p2 = a2 / a1`. Therefore, the final probability ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n    ***Careful Point 4: Interpretation of the Result.*** Since the ratio `p1 / p2` is greater than 1, the probability of Planet_1 transiting is higher. Specifically, its probability is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. The researchers should therefore prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\nNow, we match this robustly derived conclusion to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n*   B) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n*   C) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n*   D) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOur conclusion perfectly matches the statement in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate agents and highlighting crucial points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Physical Principles**\nThe objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets (Planet_1 and Planet_2) to determine which is a more favorable target for observation and by what factor. The solution is based on two fundamental principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability that it will transit its star from our vantage point is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$).\n    $p_{tr} = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) and semi-major axis ($a$) to the mass of its host star ($M_s$). For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star's, the relationship can be expressed as a proportionality:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which can be rearranged as $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$.\n\n**2. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Probabilities**\nTo compare the two planets, we set up the ratio of their transit probabilities, $p_1 / p_2$:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\nThe problem provides key information that simplifies this expression:\n*   \"both host stars have the same radii\" $\\implies R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n*   \"The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\" $\\implies M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n*   \"the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2\" $\\implies P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which is equivalent to $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Simplification due to Equal Radii**\nSince the stellar radii are equal, the ratio $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ becomes 1. This is a critical simplification identified correctly by nearly all candidate answers. The equation reduces to show that the probability ratio is simply the *inverse* of the semi-major axis ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\nThis implies that the planet with the smaller orbit (smaller $a$) will have the higher transit probability.\n\n**3. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law, we express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of the known parameters:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n**Careful Point 2: Correct Substitution**\nIt is essential to substitute the mass and period relationships correctly. We replace $M_{s1}$ in the denominator with $2 M_{s2}$ and $P_2$ in the numerator with $3 P_1$:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n**4. Solve the Expression Algebraically**\nWe now simplify the expression inside the cube root.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Squaring the Coefficient**\nA common algebraic error is to forget to square the coefficient along with the variable. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ becomes $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel from the numerator and denominator, leaving a simple numerical ratio:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n**5. Final Calculation and Conclusion**\nThe numerical value of $(4.5)^{1/3}$ is approximately **1.65**.\nSince we established in Step 2 that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$, it follows that:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n\n**Careful Point 4: Correct Interpretation of the Final Ratio**\nThe ratio is greater than 1, which means the numerator ($p_1$) is larger than the denominator ($p_2$). Therefore, the transit probability for **Planet_1** is approximately **1.65 times higher** than that of Planet_2. This makes Planet_1 the preferred target for observation.\n\nNow, we match this conclusion to the original multiple-choice options:\nA) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect planet and factor)\nB) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect factor)\nC) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect planet and factor)\nD) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (**Correct planet and factor**)\n\nThe analysis robustly supports the statement in option D. The wide variation in the letter choice among the candidate answers likely resulted from them being presented with a randomized ordering of the options, but their underlying mathematical reasoning is almost unanimously correct and converges on this same result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate solutions and a rigorous application of the relevant physics.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Principles**\n    The main objective is to determine which of two exoplanets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher geometric probability of transiting its host star, and to quantify this difference. The solution depends on two fundamental concepts in astrophysics:\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability that it will be observed to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n        $p = R_s / a$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital characteristics to its host star's mass. For a planet whose mass is negligible compared to its star's (a valid assumption for Earth-like planets), the law can be expressed as a proportionality: $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$. This can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis: $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Comparison**\n    To compare the two planets, we take the ratio of their transit probabilities, `p₁ / p₂`:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify**\n    The problem states:\n    *   $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$ (The host stars have the same radii).\n    *   $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$ (Planet_1's star is twice as massive).\n    *   $P_1 = P_2 / 3$ (Planet_1's period is three times shorter, meaning $P_2 = 3 P_1$).\n\n    The first piece of information ($R_{s1} = R_{s2}$) simplifies the probability ratio significantly, as the term $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ becomes 1. This reduces the problem to:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Ratio of Orbital Sizes**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's Law, we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes as:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    Now, we substitute the relationships for mass and period:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression**\n    We simplify the expression inside the parentheses. The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel out.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9 \\cdot P_1^2}{2 \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Calculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n    $$ (4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096 $$\n    So, the ratio is approximately 1.65.\n\n7.  **Draw the Final Conclusion**\n    We found that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\approx 1.65$. Since this ratio is greater than 1, the transit probability of Planet_1 ($p_1$) is higher than that of Planet_2 ($p_2$). The concluding statement is: **Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**\n\n### **Careful Points**\nThis problem has several potential points of error, all of which the candidate agents correctly navigated in their derivations:\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Simplification.** It is crucial to use the fact that the stellar radii are equal ($R_{s1} = R_{s2}$) to simplify the probability ratio.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Inverse Relationship.** One must correctly establish that the probability ratio ($p_1/p_2$) is equal to the *inverse* of the semi-major axis ratio ($a_2/a_1$), meaning the planet with the smaller orbit has the higher probability.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Correct Substitution.** The mass and period relationships ($M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$ and $P_2 = 3 P_1$) must be substituted into the correct positions (numerator/denominator) within the Kepler's Law ratio.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Algebraic Accuracy.** A very common algebraic mistake is forgetting to square the coefficient along with the variable. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ must be expanded to $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Interpretation.** The final ratio of ~1.65 must be correctly interpreted as Planet_1 having the higher probability, as it corresponds to the numerator in the $p_1/p_2$ ratio.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe step-by-step derivation robustly shows that \"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\" Comparing this result to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n*   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n*   C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n*   D) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n\nThe derived conclusion perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers and identifying all crucial points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Physics**\n\nThe objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 ($p_1$) and Planet_2 ($p_2$), to decide which is the better observation target and by what factor. The solution is based on two fundamental principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability it will transit its star from our viewpoint is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$).\n    $p_{tr} = R_s / a$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital characteristics to its host star. For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star, the relationship between the semi-major axis ($a$), orbital period ($P$), and stellar mass ($M_s$) is given by the proportionality:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2 \\implies a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Ratio:** To compare the planets, we create a ratio of their transit probabilities:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n    *   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n    *   Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which means $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n    **Careful Point 1: Importance of Equal Radii.** The fact that the stellar radii are equal is a critical simplification. It means the term $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ equals 1. The equation for the probability ratio reduces to:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n    This shows the transit probability is inversely proportional to the orbital distance; the planet with the smaller orbit has a higher chance to transit.\n\n3.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We use Kepler's Third Law to express the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ in terms of the known parameters:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now we substitute the relationships for mass and period.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    **Careful Point 2: Correct Algebraic Expansion.** A common error is to forget to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship.

This requires applying fundamental principles of exoplanet detection.\n\n### **Step-by-step Derivation**\n\n1.  **State the Core Physical Principles**\n    The solution relies on two key physical laws:\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability that it will be seen to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`). A planet with a smaller orbit is more likely to transit.\n        $p = R_s / a$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital properties (`a` and period `P`) to its host star's mass (`M_s`). For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star's (a valid assumption here), the law can be written as a proportionality:\n        $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which can be rearranged to solve for `a`: $a \\propto (M_s P^2)^{1/3}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    To compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting (`p_1`) to that of Planet_2 (`p_2`):\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} $$\n    This can be algebraically rearranged to separate the terms:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify**\n    The problem provides several key relationships:\n    *   **Stellar Radii:** The host stars have the same radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n    *   **Stellar Masses:** The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n    *   **Orbital Periods:** The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which implies $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n    **Careful Point 1: Equal Stellar Radii.** This is a critical simplification. Since $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, the ratio $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ is equal to 1. The probability ratio now becomes solely dependent on the inverse of the semi-major axes ratio.\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes using Kepler's Law**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's Law, we can calculate the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} P_2^2}{M_{s1} P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    **Careful Point 2: Correct Substitution.** It is essential to substitute the mass and period relationships into the correct positions. We substitute `M_s1` in the denominator with `2 M_s2`, and `P_2` in the numerator with `3 P_1`:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression**\n    Now we simplify the expression inside the cube root.\n\n    **Careful Point 3: Algebraic Accuracy.** A common mistake is to forget to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship.

Therefore, our final probability ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n    **Careful Point 4: Interpretation of the Result.** Since the ratio is greater than 1, the probability of Planet_1 transiting (`p_1`) is higher than that of Planet_2.

Assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's, we can use the proportionality:\n        $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which rearranges to $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities:**\n    To compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, $p_1 / p_2$.\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify:**\n    The problem provides key relationships:\n    *   Stellar Radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$ (\"both host stars have the same radii\").\n    *   Stellar Masses: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$ (\"star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\").\n    *   Orbital Periods: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$ (\"orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter\"). This is equivalent to $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n    **Careful Point 1: Simplifying with Radii.** Since the stellar radii are equal, the ratio $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ is 1. This is a critical simplification. The probability ratio now becomes the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes:**\n    We use the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    **Careful Point 2: Correct Substitution.** It is crucial to substitute the mass and period relationships correctly into the numerator and denominator. We replace $M_{s1}$ with $2 M_{s2}$ and $P_2$ with $3 P_1$.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression:**\n    Now we simplify the algebraic expression inside the parentheses.\n    **Careful Point 3: Algebraic Accuracy.** A common mistake is to forget to square the coefficient '3' along with the variable $P_1$. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ becomes $9 P_1^2$.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel out, leaving a simple fraction:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n    Calculating the numerical value gives $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65$.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion and Answer Selection:**\n    We established in step 3 that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. Therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n    **Careful Point 4: Correct Interpretation.** Since the ratio is greater than 1, the probability of Planet_1 transiting ($p_1$) is greater than that of Planet_2 ($p_2$). Specifically, Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times more likely to transit. The researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\nMatching this robust conclusion to the options provided in the question:\nA) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOur conclusion perfectly matches the statement in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting critical points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **1. Identify the Physical Principles and Goal**\n\nThe central task is to compare the geometric transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 ($p_1$) and Planet_2 ($p_2$), to determine which is the more likely transit candidate and by what factor. The solution hinges on two fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet with a circular orbit viewed from a random angle, the probability that it will be seen to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$). A planet in a closer orbit or orbiting a larger star has a higher probability.\n    $p_{tr} = R_s / a$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital properties ($a$, $P$) to its host star's mass ($M_s$). Assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to its star's, the law can be expressed as a proportionality:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which can be rearranged as $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n### **2. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Probabilities**\n\nTo compare the planets, we create a ratio of their transit probabilities, $p_1/p_2$:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that \"both host stars have the same radii\", so $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The role of equal stellar radii.** This is a critical simplification. Since $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, the ratio $\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}$ becomes 1. This reduces the probability comparison to a simple inverse relationship with the orbital distances:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\nThis tells us that the planet with the smaller orbit (smaller $a$) will have the higher transit probability.\n\n### **3. Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Ratio of Orbital Sizes**\n\nFrom the proportionality derived from Kepler's Law, $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$, we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes as:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nWe now substitute the remaining relationships given in the problem:\n*   Mass relationship: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$\n*   Period relationship: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which is equivalent to $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Correct substitution.** It is crucial to substitute these relationships into the correct positions (i.e., numerator vs. denominator) in the fraction.\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n### **4. Solve the Expression**\n\nNow we simplify the algebraic expression inside the parentheses.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Squaring the coefficient.** A common algebraic mistake is to forget to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ must be expanded to $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel from the numerator and denominator, leaving a simple fraction:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n### **5. Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nCalculating the final numerical value yields:\n$$ (4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096 $$\nFrom Step 2, we know that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n\n**Careful Point 4: Correct interpretation of the result.** Since the ratio $p_1 / p_2$ is approximately 1.65 (a value greater than 1), it means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is greater than that of Planet_2. Specifically, it is **~1.65 times higher**. Consequently, the researchers should prefer to observe **Planet_1**.\n\nWe now match this final conclusion to the provided options:\nA) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.

The solution requires applying the principles of geometric transit probability and Kepler's Third Law.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **State the Core Physical Principles**\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability that it will be seen to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$).\n        $p_{tr} = R_s / a$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$), its semi-major axis ($a$), and the mass of its host star ($M_s$). For a planet with a mass that is negligible compared to its star, the law can be expressed as a proportionality:\n        $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$\n        or, solving for the semi-major axis:\n        $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    To compare the two planets, we create a ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting ($p_1$) to that of Planet_2 ($p_2$):\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify**\n    The problem provides the following crucial information:\n    *   Stellar Radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$ (both host stars have the same radii).\n    *   Stellar Masses: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$ (Planet_1's star is twice as massive).\n    *   Orbital Periods: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which means $P_2 = 3 P_1$ (Planet_1's period is three times shorter).\n\n    **Careful Point 1: Use the Equality of Radii.** Since $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, the first term in our ratio, $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$, is equal to 1. This is a critical simplification. The probability ratio now depends only on the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n    This means the planet with the smaller orbit (smaller $a$) will have the higher transit probability.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law, we can write the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n    **Careful Point 2: Substitute Correctly.** It is essential to substitute the mass and period relationships into the correct positions. We replace $M_{s1}$ in the denominator with $2M_{s2}$ and $P_2$ in the numerator with $3P_1$:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression**\n    Now, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses.\n\n    **Careful Point 3: Handle Exponents Properly.** A common algebraic mistake is to forget to square the coefficient along with the variable. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ correctly becomes $9 P_1^2$.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel from the numerator and denominator, leaving a simple numerical fraction:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Calculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n    $$ (4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096... \\approx 1.65 $$\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion and Answer Selection**\n    From Step 3, we know that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. Therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n    **Careful Point 4: Interpret the Final Ratio.** Since the ratio is greater than 1, the numerator ($p_1$) is larger than the denominator ($p_2$). This means the probability of **Planet_1** transiting is higher. Specifically, it is **~1.65 times higher** than the probability for Planet_2.

Deconstruction of the Problem and Physical Principles**\n\nThe core task is to compare the geometric transit probabilities ($p$) of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to determine which is the better observation target and by what factor. The analysis relies on two fundamental concepts in astrophysics, which were correctly identified by all valid candidate answers.\n\n*   **Geometric Transit Probability ($p_{tr}$):** For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability of it transiting its star is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$). A planet closer to its star (smaller $a$) has a higher transit probability.\n    $p_{tr} = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital characteristics to its host star's properties. For a planet with a mass negligible compared to its star, the law is expressed as a proportionality: $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_s}$. Rearranging to solve for the semi-major axis gives:\n    $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n### **2. Formulation and Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\nTo compare the two planets, we formulate the ratio of their transit probabilities, $\\frac{p_1}{p_2}$:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the information given in the problem:\n*   Stellar Radii: \"both host stars have the same radii\" $\\implies R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n*   Stellar Masses: \"The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\" $\\implies M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n*   Orbital Periods: \"the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2\" $\\implies P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which can be written as $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Simplify using the Radii.** Since $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, the first term of the ratio $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ becomes 1. This is a crucial simplification and reduces the problem to comparing the orbital distances:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Express Orbital Distance using Kepler's Law.** We now substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Substitute Mass and Period Relationships.** We carefully substitute the known mass and period relationships into the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Correctly Perform the Algebra.** A common algebraic pitfall is forgetting to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ correctly becomes $9 P_1^2$.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel out, leaving a simple numerical fraction:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Calculate the Final Value.** The numerical value, confirmed by code executions across multiple agents, is:\n    $$(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65$$\n\n### **3. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe final step is to interpret this result. We found that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65$. Since this ratio is greater than 1, the probability of Planet_1 transiting ($p_1$) is greater than that of Planet_2 ($p_2$).

This requires combining the formula for geometric transit probability with Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **State the Governing Physical Principles**\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the probability it will transit is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n      $p = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For a planet with a mass that is negligible compared to its star (a valid assumption here), the law can be expressed as a proportionality:\n      $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis: $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    To compare the two planets, we find the ratio of their probabilities, $\\frac{p_1}{p_2}$:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Simplify**\n    The problem provides the following key relationships:\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n    *   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which implies $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n    **Careful Point 1: The Role of Stellar Radii.** This is a critical simplification. Since $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, the ratio $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ is equal to 1. The probability ratio therefore simplifies to the inverse of the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n    This makes intuitive sense: for a given star size, a planet with a closer orbit (smaller `a`) has a higher chance of transiting.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's law, we can express the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ in terms of the known mass and period relationships.\n\n    **Careful Point 2: Correct Substitution.** It is essential to substitute the relationships into the correct positions in the formula. We replace $M_{s1}$ in the denominator with $2 M_{s2}$ and $P_2$ in the numerator with $3 P_1$:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression**\n    We now simplify the expression inside the parentheses.\n\n    **Careful Point 3: Algebraic Accuracy.** A common mistake is to forget to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ correctly becomes $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel from the numerator and denominator, leaving:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n    Calculating the numerical value gives $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65$. Since we established in Step 3 that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$, our final probability ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n\n    **Careful Point 4: Correct Interpretation.** The final step is to interpret this result correctly. Because the ratio $\\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ is approximately 1.65 (a value greater than 1), it means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is ~1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities**\nTo compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of their probabilities, $\\frac{p_1}{p_2}$:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1} / a_1}{R_{s2} / a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n**3. Apply Given Information and Simplify**\nThe problem states that \"both host stars have the same radii,\" which means $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\nThis allows for a crucial simplification, as the term $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ equals 1. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Kepler's Law, we can express the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ in terms of the known parameters:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nWe now substitute the remaining relationships given in the problem:\n*   Mass of star 1 is twice that of star 2: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n*   Period of planet 1 is three times shorter than planet 2: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which implies $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n**5. Simplify and Solve**\nThe expression simplifies algebraically:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot P_1^2}{2 \\cdot M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel, leaving a simple numerical ratio:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65 $$\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\nSince we established in Step 3 that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$, it follows that:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\nBecause the ratio is greater than 1, the probability of Planet_1 transiting ($p_1$) is higher than that of Planet_2 ($p_2$). Specifically, it is approximately 1.65 times higher. Therefore, **Planet_1 is the preferred target.**\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Inverse Relationship:** With equal stellar radii, the transit probability ($p$) is inversely proportional to the orbital semi-major axis ($a$). A smaller orbit means a higher probability.\n2.  **Correct Substitution:** It is crucial to substitute the mass ($M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}$) and period ($P_2 = 3P_1$) relationships into the correct positions in the ratio for Kepler's Law.\n3.  **Algebraic Accuracy:** A common error is to forget to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ correctly becomes $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n4.  **Interpreting the Final Ratio:** A final ratio of $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65$ means Planet_1's probability is 1.65 times that of Planet_2's.\n\nMatching the conclusion **\"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit\"** to the original options:\n\nA) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n\nThe result from the unanimous physical reasoning of the candidate answers perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe code execution confirms the numerical result of the calculation.\n\n**Analysis Path:**\n1.  **Ratio of Probabilities:** The ratio of transit probabilities `p_1 / p_2` simplifies to the inverse ratio of the semi-major axes, `a_2 / a_1`, because the stellar radii are identical (`R_s1 = R_s2`).\n2.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using Kepler's Third Law, the ratio `a_2 / a_1` is derived as `( (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) )^(1/3)`.\n3.  **Substitution:** We substitute the given values `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` and `P_2 = 3 * P_1` into the equation.\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = ( (M_s2 * (3*P_1)^2) / (2*M_s2 * P_1^2) )^(1/3)`\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = ( (9 * M_s2 * P_1^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1^2) )^(1/3)`\n4.  **Simplification:** The terms `M_s2` and `P_1^2` cancel out, leaving:\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:** The code output provides the value for this expression: `1.6509636244473134`. This is approximately `1.65`.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since `p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`, we have `p_1 / p_2 ≈ 1.65`. This means the transit probability for **Planet_1** is approximately **1.65 times higher** than for Planet_2.\n7.  **Match to Options:** We compare this conclusion to the given choices:\n    *   **A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.** (This matches our result perfectly.)\n    *   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n    *   C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n    *   D) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n\nThe code execution confirms the numerical calculation, leading directly to the correct option.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers and identifying all careful points to ensure an accurate conclusion.\n\n### **1. Identify the Goal and Governing Principles**\n\nThe objective is to determine which of two exoplanets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher geometric probability of transiting its host star and to quantify the ratio of their probabilities. The solution relies on two fundamental principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet with a circular orbit viewed at a random inclination, the probability that it will be seen to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    $p = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star's, the law can be expressed as a proportionality:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2 \\implies a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n### **2. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Probabilities**\n\nTo compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, `p1 / p2`:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that \"both host stars have the same radii,\" which means $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** This equality of radii is a crucial piece of information. It simplifies the first term of the ratio, $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$, to 1. The equation now shows that the ratio of transit probabilities is simply the *inverse* of the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\nThis means the planet with a closer orbit (smaller `a`) has a higher chance of crossing its star's disk from our point of view.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nUsing the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law, we can express the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nWe now substitute the known relationships from the problem statement:\n*   $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$ (The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive).\n*   $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which means $P_2 = 3 P_1$ (Planet_1's period is three times shorter).\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Meticulous substitution is essential. We replace $M_{s1}$ in the denominator with $2 M_{s2}$ and $P_2$ in the numerator with $3 P_1$.\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n### **4. Solve the Expression**\n\nNow we simplify the algebraic expression.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** A common algebraic error is to forget to square the coefficient along with the variable. The term $(3 P_1)^2$ becomes $9 P_1^2$, not $3 P_1^2$.\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel out, leaving a simple numerical fraction:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\nCalculating the numerical value gives:\n$$ (4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096 $$\nSo, the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ is approximately 1.65.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nSince we found that $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$, it follows that:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n**Careful Point 4:** We must correctly interpret this result. Since the ratio is greater than 1, the probability of **Planet_1** transiting is higher. Specifically, it is **~1.65 times higher** than that of Planet_2. Therefore, researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the provided options:\n\nA) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOur conclusion perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, a consistent step-by-step derivation emerges, which I will synthesize below. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates appear to be caused by different randomizations of the multiple-choice options, but the underlying physical reasoning and calculation are in unanimous agreement.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles**\n    The problem requires comparing the transit probabilities of two exoplanets. The solution is built on two fundamental concepts:\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet on a circular orbit, its probability of transiting is the ratio of its host star's radius (`R_s`) to its own orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n      $p = R_s / a$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital properties (period `P` and semi-major axis `a`) to the mass of its host star (`M_s`). For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star, the law can be written as a proportionality:\n      $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$, which can be rearranged as $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n2.  **Formulate and Simplify the Comparison**\n    To compare Planet_1 and Planet_2, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, `p₁/p₂`:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Incorporate the Given Information**\n    We use the facts provided in the problem to substitute into the equation:\n    *   Host stars have the same radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n    *   Host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n    *   Period of Planet_1 is three times shorter: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, which means $P_2 = 3 P_1$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    The fact that the stellar radii are equal ($R_{s1} = R_{s2}$) is a crucial simplification. The term $\\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right)$ becomes 1, so the probability ratio depends only on the orbital sizes:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's Law, we can write the ratio `a₂/a₁`:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    Now, we substitute the relationships for mass and period:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Solve the Expression Algebraically**\n    We simplify the expression inside the parentheses. A critical step here is to remember to square the coefficient '3' from the period relationship.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_1^2$ cancel out, leaving a simple fraction:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n\n7.  **Final Numerical Calculation and Conclusion**\n    Calculating the value gives $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65$. Since we found that `p₁/p₂ = a₂/a₁`, we have:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n    This result means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, researchers should prefer to observe **Planet_1**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Point 1: Simplification with Equal Radii.** Recognizing that equal stellar radii mean the probability ratio `p₁/p₂` is the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio `a₂/a₁` is a key step.\n*   **Point 2: Correct Kepler's Law Application.** It is essential to correctly set up the ratio using Kepler's Third Law, `a ∝ (M_s P²)^(1/3)`.\n*   **Point 3: Meticulous Substitution.** The indices (1 vs. 2) for mass and period must be correctly placed in the numerator and denominator of the ratio.\n*   **Point 4: Algebraic Accuracy.** A common pitfall is forgetting to square the coefficient for the period, i.e., using a factor of 3 instead of $3^2=9$.\n*   **Point 5: Final Interpretation.** The ratio `p₁/p₂ ≈ 1.65` is greater than 1, confirming that `p₁` is the larger probability. The factor is ~1.65.\n\nMatching our conclusion, **\"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit\"**, to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**\n*   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n*   C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n*   D) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n\nThe result from the unanimous physical reasoning perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all careful points to ensure an accurate conclusion.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core task is to determine which of two exoplanets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher geometric probability of transiting its host star and to calculate the factor by which its probability is higher. This requires a two-part physical model: the formula for transit probability and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles**\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet with a circular orbit viewed at a random inclination, the probability that it will be seen to transit its star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n        $p = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star's, the law can be expressed as a proportionality:\n        $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2 \\implies a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n2.  **Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Probabilities**\n    To compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, `p_1 / p_2`:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/a_1}{R_{s2}/a_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Apply Given Information and Identify Careful Points**\n    The problem provides the following relationships:\n    *   `R_s1 = R_s2` (both host stars have the same radii)\n    *   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` (the star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive)\n    *   `P_1 = P_2 / 3`, which means `P_2 = 3 * P_1` (Planet_1's period is three times shorter)\n\n    **Careful Point 1: Use the simplification from equal stellar radii.**\n    The fact that `R_s1 = R_s2` is a crucial piece of information. It simplifies the ratio of the stellar radii, `(R_s1 / R_s2)`, to 1. The probability ratio now becomes solely dependent on the inverse of the semi-major axes ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} $$\n    This makes intuitive sense: a planet with a closer orbit (smaller `a`) has a higher chance of crossing its star's disk from our point of view.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes using Kepler's Law**\n    From the proportionality $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$, we can express the ratio `a₂ / a₁`:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    **Careful Point 2: Be meticulous with substitution.**\n    It is essential to substitute the relationships for mass and period correctly, ensuring the indices (1 and 2) are not mixed up. We substitute `M_s1` in the denominator with `2*M_s2`, and `P_2` in the numerator with `3*P_1`.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot (3 P_1)^2}{(2 M_{s2}) \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Expression**\n    Now we simplify the algebraic expression.\n\n    **Careful Point 3: Remember to square the period coefficient.**\n    A common algebraic error is to forget to square the '3' in the `(3*P₁)²` term. This must evaluate to `9 * P₁²`, not `3 * P₁²`.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{s2} \\cdot 9 P_1^2}{2 M_{s2} \\cdot P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    The terms `M_s2` and `P_1^2` cancel out, leaving a simple numerical fraction:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3} $$\n    Calculating the numerical value gives `~1.65`.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion and Answer Selection**\n    From our earlier steps, we established that `p₁ / p₂ = a₂ / a₁`. Therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx 1.65 $$\n    **Careful Point 4: Interpret the final ratio correctly.**\n    Since the ratio `p₁ / p₂` is `~1.65` (a value greater than 1), it means the probability of Planet_1 transiting (`p_1`) is `~1.65` times higher than that of Planet_2 (`p_2`). Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis leads to the statement: **\"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\"**\n\nComparing this conclusion to the multiple-choice options in the question:\nA) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOur result exactly matches option D.
