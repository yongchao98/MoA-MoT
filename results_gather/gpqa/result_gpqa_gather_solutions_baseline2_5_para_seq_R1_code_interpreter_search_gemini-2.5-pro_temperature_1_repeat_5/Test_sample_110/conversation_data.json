The core of the problem involves understanding Michael addition reactions and applying IUPAC nomenclature rules correctly.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. A strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) is used to create a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation.** This is the most critical step for determining the structure of Product A. We must identify which alpha-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl) has a proton to be removed.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 (C2) is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no alpha-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 (C6) is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen. It has **one alpha-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The base must deprotonate at C6. This is not a choice between kinetic or thermodynamic control; it is the only possible site, making the reaction completely regioselective. The nucleophilic attack on ethyl acrylate will originate from C6.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A.** After the nucleophilic attack, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the ring. To name the product, we follow IUPAC rules. The ester has higher naming priority than the ketone.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The entire cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name this complex substituent, the ring is numbered starting from its point of attachment (the original C6). This becomes **position 1** of the substituent ring, and it has a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering continues to give the ketone's oxo (`=O`) group the lowest possible number, which makes it **position 2**.\n    *   The ethyl and the other methyl group (originally on C2) are now located at **position 3**.\n    *   The correct name for the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**2. Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The protons on the carbon alpha to the powerful electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic and are removed by the base (KOH).\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming and Parent Chain Identification.** The nucleophile formed from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The resulting product is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group. The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon must be identified.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`\n    *   The longest chain has **six carbons**, making the parent name **hexanenitrile**. An incorrect analysis might identify the parent chain as butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the correct names for the products are:\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now compare this result to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is **Correct**.\n    *   The name for B is **Correct**.\n\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n    *   The name for A is Incorrect (improper numbering of the ring substituent).\n\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n    *   Both names are Incorrect.\n\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n    *   The name for B is Incorrect (wrong parent chain).\n\nThe only option that contains both correct IUPAC names is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we will meticulously analyze both chemical reactions. We must determine the structure of the major product for each reaction and then its correct IUPAC name. The key to this problem lies in correctly identifying the nucleophiles, the sites of reaction (regioselectivity), and adhering to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → Product A\n\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The strong, bulky base (t-BuOK) will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate, which will then attack the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step for determining the product's structure. We must identify which α-proton the base will remove.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl): C2 and C6.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and therefore has **no α-protons**. Deprotonation is impossible at this site.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom) and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since C6 is the *only* position with an α-proton, the base must deprotonate here. The reaction is completely regioselective, and the nucleophilic attack will originate from the C6 carbon.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The enolate formed at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The resulting product must be named correctly.\n    *   The ester functional group has a higher naming priority than the ketone. Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a complex substituent attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, its point of attachment on the ring (the original C6 of the ketone) is designated as **position 1**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the oxo (=O) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the other methyl group at **position 3**.\n    *   Alphabetizing the groups on the ring substituent gives its name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The complete name for **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → Product B\n\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile Formation and Attack**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, forming a nucleophilic carbanion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`). This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: IUPAC Naming of Product B**. The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is C1. The longest carbon chain including C1 must be identified to determine the parent name.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile carbon: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The parent chain is six carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. (A common mistake is to misidentify the chain length, leading to an incorrect name like butanenitrile).\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The complete name for **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct names for the two products:\n*   **Product A**: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B**: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nNow we compare these correct names with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   This option has the **Correct** name for Product A and the **Correct** name for Product B.\n*   **B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is incorrect (wrong numbering), and the name for B is incorrect (wrong parent chain).\n*   **C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is incorrect.\n*   **D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**\n    *   The name for B is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that provides the correct IUPAC names for both major products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nTo solve this problem, we must carefully determine the major products for two separate Michael addition reactions. This involves identifying the nucleophile and electrophile, determining the site of bond formation (especially considering regioselectivity), and then correctly naming the resulting products according to IUPAC nomenclature.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: The reaction involves a ketone, a strong base (`t-BuOK`), and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which are the key components of a **Michael Addition**. The base generates an enolate from the ketone, which acts as the nucleophile (the Michael donor).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most critical step for determining the structure of Product A. The base abstracts a proton from a carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl group. We must examine the two α-carbons, C2 and C6:\n    *   **α-carbon C2**: This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It possesses **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **α-carbon C6**: This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is completely regioselective by necessity, not by kinetic or thermodynamic preference. C6 becomes the nucleophilic site.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of the Product**. The nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. After protonation, a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the ring. For naming purposes, the ester has a higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The parent chain is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   To name the complex cyclohexyl substituent, its point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **position 1**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the `oxo` (=O) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   This numbering places the ethyl and the other methyl group at **position 3**.\n    *   Assembling the name alphabetically gives the substituent: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The correct name for **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael Addition. The protons on the carbon α to the powerful electron-withdrawing nitro group are very acidic.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation and Attack**: The base (`KOH`) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic carbanion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`). This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, `(E)-but-2-enenitrile`.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming of the Product**. The new bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile, yielding the structure `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile group (`-CN`) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is **C1**.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 must be identified: `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The chain is **6 carbons long**, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. A common mistake is misidentifying the parent chain as shorter (e.g., butanenitrile).\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   The correct name for **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct names for both products:\n*   **Product A**: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B**: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now evaluate the given options against our findings:\n\n*   A) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`). Name for B is correct.\n*   **B) Name for A is correct. Name for B is correct.**\n*   C) Name for A is correct. Name for B is incorrect (`...butanenitrile`).\n*   D) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`). Name for B is incorrect (`...butanenitrile`).\n\nThe only option that provides the correct IUPAC names for both major products is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful points noted.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: The combination of a ketone, a strong base, and an α,β-unsaturated ester indicates this is a **Michael addition** reaction. The base generates a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone.\n2.  **Product A Structure**:\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most critical step for determining the correct product structure. The base removes an acidic α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl). We must examine the two α-carbons, C2 and C6:\n        *   The α-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n        *   The α-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom). It has **one α-proton**.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. This reaction is completely regioselective by necessity, not preference. The nucleophilic attack will originate from C6.\n    *   **Attack**: The C6 enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. After workup, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n3.  **Product A IUPAC Naming**:\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Functional Group Priority**. The ester functional group has a higher priority for IUPAC naming than the ketone group. Therefore, the product is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring system is a complex substituent.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Naming the Complex Substituent**.\n        1.  The parent chain is `ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate`.\n        2.  To name the substituent ring, numbering begins at its point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone), which becomes **position 1** of the substituent. This position has a methyl group.\n        3.  The ring is then numbered to give the oxo (=O) group the lowest possible locant, placing it at **position 2**.\n        4.  This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the second methyl group at **position 3**.\n        5.  The correct name for the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   **Full Name of A**: The full name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH as base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a **Michael addition**. The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n2.  **Product B Structure**:\n    *   **Nucleophile Formation**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic carbanion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`).\n    *   **Attack**: This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile, forming the product structure `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n3.  **Product B IUPAC Naming**:\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Principal Functional Group and Parent Chain**. The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group. The IUPAC name is based on the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   **Careful Point 5: Correct Parent Chain Length**. The longest chain has six carbons. An incorrect analysis might identify a shorter parent chain (e.g., a butanenitrile). The correct parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   **Substituents**: The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   **Full Name of B**: The full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct names for the products are:\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now match these two correct names to the given options:\n\n*   A) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`), while Name for B is correct.\n*   B) **Name for A is correct, and Name for B is correct.**\n*   C) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`), and Name for B is incorrect (`...butanenitrile`).\n*   D) Name for A is correct, but Name for B is incorrect (`...butanenitrile`).\n\nThe only option that contains both correct IUPAC names is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step synthesis of the provided analyses, here is a definitive breakdown of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → Product A\n\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael Addition. A strong base (t-BuOK) forms a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step. The ketone has two alpha-carbons (adjacent to the carbonyl), at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2**: This is a quaternary carbon bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group. It has **no alpha-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **C6**: This is a tertiary carbon bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen. It has **one alpha-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The base *must* remove the single available proton from C6. This is not a choice between kinetic and thermodynamic products but is dictated by the structure. The reaction is completely regioselective.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Correct IUPAC Naming of the Product**. After the enolate at C6 attacks ethyl acrylate, a new group is attached to the ring. For naming, the ester functional group has a higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring is a complex substituent on this chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, its point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **position 1**. This position has a **methyl** group.\n    *   The ring is then numbered to give the oxo (=O) group the lowest possible locant, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   The substituents originally on C2 of the ketone (the ethyl and the other methyl group) are now at **position 3**.\n    *   Assembling the name gives the substituent: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → Product B\n\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael Addition. The protons on the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile Formation and Product Structure**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane to form the nucleophile. This attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile, creating the product with the structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Parent Chain Identification for IUPAC Naming**: The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon must be C1.\n    *   We must find the longest carbon chain containing C1: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The chain is six carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. A common mistake is to misidentify the parent chain as a shorter \"butanenitrile\".\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis:\n*   **Correct Name for A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Correct Name for B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now compare these correct names to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is **Correct**.\n    *   The name for B is **Correct**.\n\n*   **B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is Incorrect (wrong numbering on the ring).\n    *   The name for B is Incorrect (wrong parent chain).\n\n*   **C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is **Correct**.\n    *   The name for B is Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is Incorrect.\n    *   The name for B is **Correct**.\n\nOnly option A contains the correct names for both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, the correct solution can be determined by systematically breaking down each reaction and focusing on the critical points of regioselectivity and IUPAC nomenclature. The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the chemical principles, with discrepancies in the final letter choice likely arising from variations in the options presented to them.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n#### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a **Michael Addition**. The strong, non-nucleophilic base (t-BuOK) generates a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which subsequently attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation.** The first crucial step is to identify which α-proton will be abstracted by the base.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has **no α-protons**. Deprotonation at this site is impossible.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen) and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The base must abstract the single available proton from C6. This is not a choice between kinetic vs. thermodynamic control but a matter of structural necessity. The reaction is completely regioselective, with the nucleophilic attack originating from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A.** The ester functional group has higher priority for naming than the ketone. Consequently, the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent.\n    *   To name the substituent ring, numbering begins at its point of attachment (the original C6). This is designated as **position 1**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering of the ring continues to give the carbonyl (`oxo`) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the other methyl group at **position 3**.\n    *   The complete name for the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   **Final Name for A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n#### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O) → B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael Addition. Protons on the carbon alpha to a nitro group are acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile Formation & Attack.** The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a nucleophilic carbanion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`). This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 4: IUPAC Naming of Product B.** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), and its carbon is designated C1 for naming.\n    *   The longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon must be identified. The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Numbering the chain from C1 gives: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The longest chain is **six carbons long**, making the parent name **hexanenitrile**. A common error is misidentifying a shorter chain, leading to an incorrect name like butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   **Final Name for B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   **Product A is:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B is:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now match these correct names to the provided options:\n\n*   A) A = `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` (**Correct**), B = `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile` (Incorrect)\n*   B) A = `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` (Incorrect), B = `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile` (Incorrect)\n*   C) A = `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` (Incorrect), B = `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile` (**Correct**)\n*   D) A = `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` (**Correct**), B = `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile` (**Correct**)\n\nThe only option that contains both correct IUPAC names is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a careful examination of the chemical principles involved.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction:** `2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A`\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a **Michael Addition**. A strong base (`t-BuOK`) forms a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation.** This is the most critical step for determining the correct structure of Product A. The base must abstract an acidic proton from a carbon adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group.\n    *   The alpha-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group). It has **no alpha-protons**, so deprotonation is impossible at this position.\n    *   The alpha-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom). It has **one alpha-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The base can only deprotonate at C6. This is not a matter of kinetic vs. thermodynamic control but a structural necessity. The reaction is completely regioselective, and the new bond will form at C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A.** After the nucleophilic C6 attacks ethyl acrylate, a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to the ring. The ester functional group has higher priority for naming than the ketone.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent.\n    *   To name the complex ring substituent, numbering begins at its point of attachment to the propanoate chain (the original C6). This is **position 1** of the substituent, which has a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering of the ring continues to give the `oxo` (=O) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   The carbon bearing the ethyl and the second methyl group is therefore at **position 3**.\n    *   Assembling the name for the substituent gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction:** `1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B`\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael Addition**. The protons on the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile Formation and Attack.** The base (`KOH`) deprotonates the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic carbanion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 4: IUPAC Naming of Product B.** The product's structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (`-CN`) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is designated **C1**.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 must be identified to determine the parent name. This chain is six carbons long: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**. The name `butanenitrile` is incorrect as it does not represent the longest carbon chain.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct names for the major products:\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nNow, we compare these correct names with the provided options:\n\n*   **A)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Incorrect), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct)\n*   **B)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Correct), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect)\n*   **C)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (**Correct**), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct**)\n*   **D)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Incorrect), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect)\n\nThe only option that has the correct IUPAC names for both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of two separate Michael addition reactions to determine the major product for each, followed by correctly naming them according to IUPAC rules.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael Addition. The strong base (t-BuOK) creates a nucleophile by forming an enolate from the ketone. This nucleophile then adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step for determining the product's structure. The base abstracts a proton from a carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl group. We must inspect the two α-carbons, C2 and C6:\n    *   The α-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom). It possesses **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. This reaction is completely regioselective by necessity, not preference (kinetic vs. thermodynamic control is not a factor here). The nucleophilic attack on ethyl acrylate must originate from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The product has an ester and a ketone functional group. The ester has higher priority for IUPAC naming.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The entire cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the complex ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone) is numbered **C1'**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering of the substituent ring must then give the highest priority group on the ring (the oxo group) the lowest possible number. This places the oxo group at **C2'**.\n    *   Following this numbering, the ethyl and the second methyl group are located on **C3'**.\n    *   Assembling the substituent name alphabetically gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full, correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael Addition. The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic carbanion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n3.  **Careful Point 3: Parent Chain Identification and Naming of Product B**. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The final structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN). The IUPAC name is based on the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   Numbering must start from the nitrile carbon as C1: `N≡C(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The longest chain has **six carbons**, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. An incorrect analysis might identify a shorter four-carbon chain, leading to the wrong parent name (`butanenitrile`).\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full, correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct names for the two products:\n*   **Product A**: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B**: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nComparing these with the given options:\n\n*   A) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`).

The base will generate a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone.\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. The most crucial step is determining which α-proton the base will abstract. The ketone has two α-carbons (adjacent to the carbonyl): C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, and the nucleophilic attack on the ethyl acrylate will originate from C6.\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Nomenclature of the Product**. After the C6 enolate attacks ethyl acrylate, a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the cyclohexanone ring. For IUPAC naming, the ester functional group has a higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring system becomes a substituent on C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the complex substituent, the ring is numbered starting from its point of attachment (the original C6). This becomes **position 1**. This position has a **methyl** group.\n    *   The ring is then numbered to give the oxo (=O) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the second methyl group at **position 3**.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent alphabetically gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct full name for **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction:** `1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) ---> B`\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a **Michael Addition**. Protons on the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a nucleophilic carbanion `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n3.  **Careful Point 3: Parent Chain Identification for Naming**. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The resulting product's structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (`–CN`) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is designated **C1**.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 must be identified: `N≡C¹–C²H₂–C³H(CH₃)–C⁴H(NO₂)–C⁵H₂–C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The parent chain has **six carbons**.

A strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) is used to create a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step for determining the correct product structure. The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and therefore has **no α-protons**. Deprotonation at this site is impossible.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since C6 is the only position with an available α-proton, the base *must* deprotonate at this position. The reaction is completely regioselective, and the nucleophilic attack on ethyl acrylate will originate from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. After the attack, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the cyclohexanone ring. For IUPAC naming, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the complex substituent ring, its point of attachment on the ring (the original C6) is designated as position **1**. This position has a **methyl** group.\n    *   The ring must then be numbered to give the oxo (=O) group the lowest possible number, making the original carbonyl carbon position **2**.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the other methyl group on position **3**.\n    *   Alphabetizing the groups on the substituent gives the name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The correct, full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael Addition. The protons on the carbon α to the powerful electron-withdrawing nitro group are highly acidic.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming of Product B**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophile, which attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The resulting product structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name the product, we must identify the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group, the nitrile (`-CN`). The nitrile carbon is designated as C1.\n    *   The longest chain is six carbons long: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   Therefore, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.

This is the most critical step for determining the product's structure. We must find which α-proton the base will remove.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, and the nucleophilic attack will originate from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. After the attack on ethyl acrylate, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the ring. To name the product, we follow IUPAC priority rules. The ester has higher priority than the ketone, so the molecule is named as a substituted `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a complex substituent on carbon-3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name this substituent, its point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **position 1**. This carbon also has a methyl group.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the `oxo` (=O) group the lowest possible locant, which places it at **position 2**.\n    *   The ethyl and the other methyl group are on **position 3**.\n    *   The full substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH (a strong base).\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a **Michael Addition**. The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile and Product Structure**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, creating the nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The resulting product's structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n3.  **Careful Point 4: IUPAC Naming of Product B**. To name the product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   Numbering must start from the nitrile carbon as C1: `N≡C(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The longest chain has **six carbons**, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. It is a common mistake to misidentify a shorter chain.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct IUPAC names:\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (**Incorrect name for A**), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct name for B**)\n*   **B)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (**Incorrect name for A**), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (**Incorrect name for B**)\n*   **C)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (**Correct name for A**), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (**Incorrect name for B**)\n*   **D)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (**Correct name for A**), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct name for B**)\n\nThe only option that contains the correct names for both products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\nThe problem requires determining the major products of two separate chemical reactions and selecting the option that provides the correct IUPAC names for both. The reactions are both examples of Michael additions.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> Product A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. A strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most critical step for determining the structure of Product A. The ketone has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. This makes the reaction completely regioselective, with the nucleophilic attack originating from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. To name the resulting product, we must follow IUPAC priority rules, where the ester group is higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name this complex substituent, numbering of the ring begins at its point of attachment. The original C6 carbon is now **position 1'**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering continues to give the `oxo` (=O) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2'**.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the other methyl group at **position 3'**.\n    *   Assembling the name alphabetically gives the substituent: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full, correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> Product B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The protons on the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile Formation and Attack**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form the nucleophile, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n3.  **Careful Point 4: IUPAC Naming and Parent Chain Identification**. The final structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 must be identified: `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The parent chain is six carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. An incorrect analysis might identify a shorter butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full, correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the thorough analysis:\n*   The correct name for **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   The correct name for **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nWe now compare this result to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is **Correct**.\n    *   The name for B is **Correct**.\n*   **B)** The name for B is incorrect (`...nitrobutanenitrile` identifies the wrong parent chain).\n*   **C)** The name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...` incorrectly numbers the substituent ring).\n*   **D)** The names for both A and B are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option that contains the correct IUPAC names for both products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → Product A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: The reaction involves a ketone, a strong base, and an α,β-unsaturated ester. This is a **Michael Addition**. The base (t-BuOK) generates a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated system of ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step for determining the product's structure. The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl): C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated by the base.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. This is not a matter of kinetic vs. thermodynamic control; it is the only chemically possible outcome. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, with C6 becoming the nucleophilic atom.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The nucleophilic C6 atom attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. For naming, the ester functional group has a higher priority than the ketone, so the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the complex cyclohexanone substituent, its point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **position 1**. This carbon has a methyl group.\n    *   The ring is then numbered to give the carbonyl (`=O`) group the lowest possible locant, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   The carbon bearing the ethyl and the second methyl group is now at **position 3**.\n    *   The complete name for the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The final, correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → Product B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a **Michael Addition**. The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a nucleophilic carbanion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 3: Parent Chain Identification and Naming**. The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (`-CN`) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 is six carbons long: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`. An error here would be to misidentify the chain length and name it as a derivative of butanenitrile.\n    *   The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The final, correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the thorough analysis:\n*   **Correct Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Correct Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now compare these correct names to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`), and Name for B is incorrect (`...butanenitrile`).\n*   B) Name for A is incorrect, and Name for B is correct.\n*   C) Name for A is correct, but Name for B is incorrect.\n*   **D) Name for A is correct, AND Name for B is correct.**\n\nThe only option that correctly names both major products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, based on a consensus of chemical principles from the candidate answers and a rigorous evaluation of the problem.\n\nThe problem asks for the major products of two separate reactions and to select the option with the correct IUPAC names for both.

The strong base (t-BuOK) forms a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step for determining the structure of Product A. The base must abstract a proton from a carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl group. We must inspect the two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen). It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, forming a single enolate with C6 as the nucleophilic atom.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. For naming, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. The molecule is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the complex substituent ring, numbering begins at its point of attachment (the original C6).

The α-protons of a nitroalkane are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing nitro group.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Parent Chain Identification and Naming**. The nucleophile formed from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile, yielding the structure `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the highest priority functional group, the nitrile (`-CN`).

    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we must meticulously analyze both chemical reactions to find the structure and then the correct IUPAC name of the major product.\n\n#### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: `2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A`\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: The reaction involves a ketone, a strong base (`t-BuOK`), and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate). This is a classic **Michael Addition**. The base is used to form a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most critical step in determining the product's structure. The base abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl group. We must inspect the two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons**, so deprotonation is impossible at this site.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom). It possesses **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. This makes the reaction completely regioselective, not due to a preference (kinetic vs. thermodynamic) but due to structural necessity. The new C-C bond will form at C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The enolate at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. To name the resulting product, we must follow IUPAC priority rules. The ester functional group has a higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring system is a complex substituent.\n    *   To name the substituent, its point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **position 1**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   The ring is then numbered to give the principal functional group on the ring, the oxo group (`=O`), the lowest possible locant. This places it at **position 2**.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the second methyl group at **position 3**.\n    *   Arranging the groups alphabetically gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Thus, the full name for **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n#### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: `1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) ---> B`\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a **Michael Addition**. The protons on the carbon alpha to the powerfully electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic and are readily removed by a base.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile Formation and Product Structure**. The base (`KOH`) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming the nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile, forming the product: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 4: Parent Chain Identification for IUPAC Naming**. To name the product, we must find the longest carbon chain that includes the highest priority functional group, the nitrile (`-CN`).\n    *   The nitrile carbon is designated **C1**.\n    *   The longest continuous carbon chain including C1 is six carbons long: `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   A common mistake is to misidentify the parent chain as a four-carbon butanenitrile derivative. The correct parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   Thus, the full name for **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis:\n*   The correct name for **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct name for **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nWe now compare this correct pair of names with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   This option provides the **Correct** name for Product A and the **Correct** name for Product B.\n\n*   **B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**\n    *   The name for B is incorrect (wrong parent chain).\n\n*   **C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is incorrect (improper numbering of the ring substituent).\n\n*   **D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**\n    *   Both names are incorrect.\n\nThe only option that contains both correct IUPAC names is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **α-carbon C6**: This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since C6 is the only position with an available α-proton, the base *must* deprotonate at this position. The reaction is completely regioselective, and the nucleophilic attack will originate from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The enolate at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. After workup, a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to C6. To name the resulting product, we must follow IUPAC priority rules. The ester group has higher priority than the ketone group.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the complex substituent, the ring is numbered starting from its point of attachment (the original C6), which becomes **position 1'**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   The numbering continues to give the ketone's oxo (`=O`) group the lowest possible number, which places it at **position 2'**.\n    *   This numbering scheme locates the ethyl and the second methyl group at **position 3'**.\n    *   The full name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: `1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B`\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a **Michael addition**. The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane to form the nucleophile, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n3.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming of Product B**. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The final structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the **nitrile (`–CN`)**. For IUPAC naming, we must find the longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon.\n    *   Numbering must start from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `N≡C(1) – CH₂(2) – CH(3)(CH₃) – CH(4)(NO₂) – CH₂(5) – CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has **six carbons**, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. A common mistake is to misidentify the parent chain, leading to an incorrect name like butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct names for both products:\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nNow, we compare these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) Name for A is correct, but the name for B is incorrect (`...butanenitrile`).\n*   B) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl`), and the name for B is incorrect.\n*   C) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl`), but the name for B is correct.\n*   D) Name for A is correct, AND the name for B is correct.\n\nThe only option that matches both correct names is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided solutions.\n\nThe problem asks for the major products of two separate reactions and to select the option with the correct IUPAC names for both. The core of the problem involves understanding Michael addition reactions and applying IUPAC nomenclature rules correctly.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. A strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) is used to create a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation.** This is the most critical step for determining the structure of Product A. We must identify which alpha-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl) has a proton to be removed.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 (C2) is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no alpha-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 (C6) is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen. It has **one alpha-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The base must deprotonate at C6. This is not a choice between kinetic or thermodynamic control; it is the only possible site, making the reaction completely regioselective. The nucleophilic attack on ethyl acrylate will originate from C6.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A.** After the nucleophilic attack, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the ring. To name the product, we follow IUPAC rules. The ester has higher naming priority than the ketone.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The entire cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name this complex substituent, the ring is numbered starting from its point of attachment (the original C6). This becomes **position 1** of the substituent ring, and it has a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering continues to give the ketone's oxo (`=O`) group the lowest possible number, which makes it **position 2**.\n    *   The ethyl and the other methyl group (originally on C2) are now located at **position 3**.\n    *   The correct name for the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**2. Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The protons on the carbon alpha to the powerful electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic and are removed by the base (KOH).\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming and Parent Chain Identification.** The nucleophile formed from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The resulting product is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group. The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon must be identified.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`\n    *   The longest chain has **six carbons**, making the parent name **hexanenitrile**. An incorrect analysis might identify the parent chain as butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the correct names for the products are:\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now compare this result to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is **Correct**.\n    *   The name for B is **Correct**.\n\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n    *   The name for A is Incorrect (improper numbering of the ring substituent).\n\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n    *   Both names are Incorrect.\n\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n    *   The name for B is Incorrect (wrong parent chain).\n\nThe only option that contains both correct IUPAC names is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we will meticulously analyze both chemical reactions. We must determine the structure of the major product for each reaction and then its correct IUPAC name. The key to this problem lies in correctly identifying the nucleophiles, the sites of reaction (regioselectivity), and adhering to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → Product A\n\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The strong, bulky base (t-BuOK) will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate, which will then attack the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step for determining the product's structure. We must identify which α-proton the base will remove.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl): C2 and C6.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and therefore has **no α-protons**. Deprotonation is impossible at this site.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom) and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since C6 is the *only* position with an α-proton, the base must deprotonate here. The reaction is completely regioselective, and the nucleophilic attack will originate from the C6 carbon.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The enolate formed at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The resulting product must be named correctly.\n    *   The ester functional group has a higher naming priority than the ketone. Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a complex substituent attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, its point of attachment on the ring (the original C6 of the ketone) is designated as **position 1**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the oxo (=O) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the other methyl group at **position 3**.\n    *   Alphabetizing the groups on the ring substituent gives its name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The complete name for **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → Product B\n\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile Formation and Attack**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, forming a nucleophilic carbanion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`). This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: IUPAC Naming of Product B**. The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is C1. The longest carbon chain including C1 must be identified to determine the parent name.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile carbon: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The parent chain is six carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. (A common mistake is to misidentify the chain length, leading to an incorrect name like butanenitrile).\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The complete name for **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct names for the two products:\n*   **Product A**: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B**: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nNow we compare these correct names with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   This option has the **Correct** name for Product A and the **Correct** name for Product B.\n*   **B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is incorrect (wrong numbering), and the name for B is incorrect (wrong parent chain).\n*   **C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is incorrect.\n*   **D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**\n    *   The name for B is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that provides the correct IUPAC names for both major products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nTo solve this problem, we must carefully determine the major products for two separate Michael addition reactions. This involves identifying the nucleophile and electrophile, determining the site of bond formation (especially considering regioselectivity), and then correctly naming the resulting products according to IUPAC nomenclature.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: The reaction involves a ketone, a strong base (`t-BuOK`), and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which are the key components of a **Michael Addition**. The base generates an enolate from the ketone, which acts as the nucleophile (the Michael donor).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most critical step for determining the structure of Product A. The base abstracts a proton from a carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl group. We must examine the two α-carbons, C2 and C6:\n    *   **α-carbon C2**: This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It possesses **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **α-carbon C6**: This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is completely regioselective by necessity, not by kinetic or thermodynamic preference. C6 becomes the nucleophilic site.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of the Product**. The nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. After protonation, a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the ring. For naming purposes, the ester has a higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The parent chain is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   To name the complex cyclohexyl substituent, its point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **position 1**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the `oxo` (=O) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   This numbering places the ethyl and the other methyl group at **position 3**.\n    *   Assembling the name alphabetically gives the substituent: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The correct name for **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael Addition. The protons on the carbon α to the powerful electron-withdrawing nitro group are very acidic.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation and Attack**: The base (`KOH`) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic carbanion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`). This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, `(E)-but-2-enenitrile`.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming of the Product**. The new bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile, yielding the structure `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile group (`-CN`) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is **C1**.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 must be identified: `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The chain is **6 carbons long**, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. A common mistake is misidentifying the parent chain as shorter (e.g., butanenitrile).\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   The correct name for **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct names for both products:\n*   **Product A**: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B**: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now evaluate the given options against our findings:\n\n*   A) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`). Name for B is correct.\n*   **B) Name for A is correct. Name for B is correct.**\n*   C) Name for A is correct. Name for B is incorrect (`...butanenitrile`).\n*   D) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`). Name for B is incorrect (`...butanenitrile`).\n\nThe only option that provides the correct IUPAC names for both major products is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful points noted.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: The combination of a ketone, a strong base, and an α,β-unsaturated ester indicates this is a **Michael addition** reaction. The base generates a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone.\n2.  **Product A Structure**:\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most critical step for determining the correct product structure. The base removes an acidic α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl). We must examine the two α-carbons, C2 and C6:\n        *   The α-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n        *   The α-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom). It has **one α-proton**.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. This reaction is completely regioselective by necessity, not preference. The nucleophilic attack will originate from C6.\n    *   **Attack**: The C6 enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. After workup, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n3.  **Product A IUPAC Naming**:\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Functional Group Priority**. The ester functional group has a higher priority for IUPAC naming than the ketone group. Therefore, the product is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring system is a complex substituent.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Naming the Complex Substituent**.\n        1.  The parent chain is `ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate`.\n        2.  To name the substituent ring, numbering begins at its point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone), which becomes **position 1** of the substituent. This position has a methyl group.\n        3.  The ring is then numbered to give the oxo (=O) group the lowest possible locant, placing it at **position 2**.\n        4.  This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the second methyl group at **position 3**.\n        5.  The correct name for the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   **Full Name of A**: The full name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH as base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a **Michael addition**. The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n2.  **Product B Structure**:\n    *   **Nucleophile Formation**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic carbanion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`).\n    *   **Attack**: This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile, forming the product structure `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n3.  **Product B IUPAC Naming**:\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Principal Functional Group and Parent Chain**. The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group. The IUPAC name is based on the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   **Careful Point 5: Correct Parent Chain Length**. The longest chain has six carbons. An incorrect analysis might identify a shorter parent chain (e.g., a butanenitrile). The correct parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   **Substituents**: The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   **Full Name of B**: The full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct names for the products are:\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now match these two correct names to the given options:\n\n*   A) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`), while Name for B is correct.\n*   B) **Name for A is correct, and Name for B is correct.**\n*   C) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`), and Name for B is incorrect (`...butanenitrile`).\n*   D) Name for A is correct, but Name for B is incorrect (`...butanenitrile`).\n\nThe only option that contains both correct IUPAC names is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step synthesis of the provided analyses, here is a definitive breakdown of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → Product A\n\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael Addition. A strong base (t-BuOK) forms a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step. The ketone has two alpha-carbons (adjacent to the carbonyl), at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2**: This is a quaternary carbon bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group. It has **no alpha-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **C6**: This is a tertiary carbon bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen. It has **one alpha-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The base *must* remove the single available proton from C6. This is not a choice between kinetic and thermodynamic products but is dictated by the structure. The reaction is completely regioselective.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Correct IUPAC Naming of the Product**. After the enolate at C6 attacks ethyl acrylate, a new group is attached to the ring. For naming, the ester functional group has a higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring is a complex substituent on this chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, its point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **position 1**. This position has a **methyl** group.\n    *   The ring is then numbered to give the oxo (=O) group the lowest possible locant, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   The substituents originally on C2 of the ketone (the ethyl and the other methyl group) are now at **position 3**.\n    *   Assembling the name gives the substituent: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → Product B\n\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael Addition. The protons on the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile Formation and Product Structure**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane to form the nucleophile. This attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile, creating the product with the structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Parent Chain Identification for IUPAC Naming**: The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon must be C1.\n    *   We must find the longest carbon chain containing C1: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The chain is six carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. A common mistake is to misidentify the parent chain as a shorter \"butanenitrile\".\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis:\n*   **Correct Name for A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Correct Name for B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now compare these correct names to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is **Correct**.\n    *   The name for B is **Correct**.\n\n*   **B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is Incorrect (wrong numbering on the ring).\n    *   The name for B is Incorrect (wrong parent chain).\n\n*   **C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is **Correct**.\n    *   The name for B is Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is Incorrect.\n    *   The name for B is **Correct**.\n\nOnly option A contains the correct names for both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, the correct solution can be determined by systematically breaking down each reaction and focusing on the critical points of regioselectivity and IUPAC nomenclature. The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the chemical principles, with discrepancies in the final letter choice likely arising from variations in the options presented to them.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n#### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a **Michael Addition**. The strong, non-nucleophilic base (t-BuOK) generates a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which subsequently attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation.** The first crucial step is to identify which α-proton will be abstracted by the base.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has **no α-protons**. Deprotonation at this site is impossible.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen) and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The base must abstract the single available proton from C6. This is not a choice between kinetic vs. thermodynamic control but a matter of structural necessity. The reaction is completely regioselective, with the nucleophilic attack originating from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A.** The ester functional group has higher priority for naming than the ketone. Consequently, the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent.\n    *   To name the substituent ring, numbering begins at its point of attachment (the original C6). This is designated as **position 1**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering of the ring continues to give the carbonyl (`oxo`) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the other methyl group at **position 3**.\n    *   The complete name for the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   **Final Name for A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n#### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O) → B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael Addition. Protons on the carbon alpha to a nitro group are acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile Formation & Attack.** The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a nucleophilic carbanion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`). This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 4: IUPAC Naming of Product B.** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), and its carbon is designated C1 for naming.\n    *   The longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon must be identified. The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Numbering the chain from C1 gives: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The longest chain is **six carbons long**, making the parent name **hexanenitrile**. A common error is misidentifying a shorter chain, leading to an incorrect name like butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   **Final Name for B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   **Product A is:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B is:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now match these correct names to the provided options:\n\n*   A) A = `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` (**Correct**), B = `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile` (Incorrect)\n*   B) A = `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` (Incorrect), B = `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile` (Incorrect)\n*   C) A = `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` (Incorrect), B = `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile` (**Correct**)\n*   D) A = `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` (**Correct**), B = `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile` (**Correct**)\n\nThe only option that contains both correct IUPAC names is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a careful examination of the chemical principles involved.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction:** `2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A`\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a **Michael Addition**. A strong base (`t-BuOK`) forms a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation.** This is the most critical step for determining the correct structure of Product A. The base must abstract an acidic proton from a carbon adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group.\n    *   The alpha-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group). It has **no alpha-protons**, so deprotonation is impossible at this position.\n    *   The alpha-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom). It has **one alpha-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The base can only deprotonate at C6. This is not a matter of kinetic vs. thermodynamic control but a structural necessity. The reaction is completely regioselective, and the new bond will form at C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A.** After the nucleophilic C6 attacks ethyl acrylate, a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to the ring. The ester functional group has higher priority for naming than the ketone.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent.\n    *   To name the complex ring substituent, numbering begins at its point of attachment to the propanoate chain (the original C6). This is **position 1** of the substituent, which has a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering of the ring continues to give the `oxo` (=O) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   The carbon bearing the ethyl and the second methyl group is therefore at **position 3**.\n    *   Assembling the name for the substituent gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction:** `1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B`\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael Addition**. The protons on the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile Formation and Attack.** The base (`KOH`) deprotonates the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic carbanion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 4: IUPAC Naming of Product B.** The product's structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (`-CN`) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is designated **C1**.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 must be identified to determine the parent name. This chain is six carbons long: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**. The name `butanenitrile` is incorrect as it does not represent the longest carbon chain.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct names for the major products:\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nNow, we compare these correct names with the provided options:\n\n*   **A)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Incorrect), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct)\n*   **B)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Correct), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect)\n*   **C)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (**Correct**), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct**)\n*   **D)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Incorrect), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect)\n\nThe only option that has the correct IUPAC names for both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of two separate Michael addition reactions to determine the major product for each, followed by correctly naming them according to IUPAC rules.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael Addition. The strong base (t-BuOK) creates a nucleophile by forming an enolate from the ketone. This nucleophile then adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step for determining the product's structure. The base abstracts a proton from a carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl group. We must inspect the two α-carbons, C2 and C6:\n    *   The α-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom). It possesses **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. This reaction is completely regioselective by necessity, not preference (kinetic vs. thermodynamic control is not a factor here). The nucleophilic attack on ethyl acrylate must originate from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The product has an ester and a ketone functional group. The ester has higher priority for IUPAC naming.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The entire cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the complex ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone) is numbered **C1'**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering of the substituent ring must then give the highest priority group on the ring (the oxo group) the lowest possible number. This places the oxo group at **C2'**.\n    *   Following this numbering, the ethyl and the second methyl group are located on **C3'**.\n    *   Assembling the substituent name alphabetically gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full, correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael Addition. The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic carbanion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n3.  **Careful Point 3: Parent Chain Identification and Naming of Product B**. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The final structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN). The IUPAC name is based on the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   Numbering must start from the nitrile carbon as C1: `N≡C(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The longest chain has **six carbons**, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. An incorrect analysis might identify a shorter four-carbon chain, leading to the wrong parent name (`butanenitrile`).\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full, correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct names for the two products:\n*   **Product A**: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B**: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nComparing these with the given options:\n\n*   A) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`).

The base will generate a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone.\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. The most crucial step is determining which α-proton the base will abstract. The ketone has two α-carbons (adjacent to the carbonyl): C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, and the nucleophilic attack on the ethyl acrylate will originate from C6.\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Nomenclature of the Product**. After the C6 enolate attacks ethyl acrylate, a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the cyclohexanone ring. For IUPAC naming, the ester functional group has a higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**. The cyclohexanone ring system becomes a substituent on C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the complex substituent, the ring is numbered starting from its point of attachment (the original C6). This becomes **position 1**. This position has a **methyl** group.\n    *   The ring is then numbered to give the oxo (=O) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the second methyl group at **position 3**.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent alphabetically gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct full name for **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction:** `1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) ---> B`\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a **Michael Addition**. Protons on the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a nucleophilic carbanion `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n3.  **Careful Point 3: Parent Chain Identification for Naming**. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The resulting product's structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (`–CN`) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is designated **C1**.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 must be identified: `N≡C¹–C²H₂–C³H(CH₃)–C⁴H(NO₂)–C⁵H₂–C⁶H₃`.\n    *   The parent chain has **six carbons**. Therefore, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. A common error is to misidentify the chain length and name it incorrectly as a butanenitrile derivative.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at **C3** and a **nitro** group at **C4**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct full name for **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct IUPAC names are:\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now match this pair of names with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile** (This option correctly identifies both A and B.)\n*   **B)** The name for A is incorrect (wrong numbering: `...3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl...`).\n*   **C)** The name for B is incorrect (wrong parent chain: `...butanenitrile`).\n*   **D)** The names for both A and B are incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly names both major products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe task requires us to determine the major products of two separate chemical reactions and select the option that provides the correct IUPAC names for both.

A strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) is used to create a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step for determining the correct product structure. The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and therefore has **no α-protons**. Deprotonation at this site is impossible.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since C6 is the only position with an available α-proton, the base *must* deprotonate at this position. The reaction is completely regioselective, and the nucleophilic attack on ethyl acrylate will originate from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. After the attack, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the cyclohexanone ring. For IUPAC naming, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the complex substituent ring, its point of attachment on the ring (the original C6) is designated as position **1**. This position has a **methyl** group.\n    *   The ring must then be numbered to give the oxo (=O) group the lowest possible number, making the original carbonyl carbon position **2**.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the other methyl group on position **3**.\n    *   Alphabetizing the groups on the substituent gives the name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The correct, full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael Addition. The protons on the carbon α to the powerful electron-withdrawing nitro group are highly acidic.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming of Product B**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophile, which attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The resulting product structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name the product, we must identify the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group, the nitrile (`-CN`). The nitrile carbon is designated as C1.\n    *   The longest chain is six carbons long: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   Therefore, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.

The base deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate, which then adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most critical step for determining the product's structure. We must find which α-proton the base will remove.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, and the nucleophilic attack will originate from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. After the attack on ethyl acrylate, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the ring. To name the product, we follow IUPAC priority rules. The ester has higher priority than the ketone, so the molecule is named as a substituted `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a complex substituent on carbon-3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name this substituent, its point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **position 1**. This carbon also has a methyl group.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the `oxo` (=O) group the lowest possible locant, which places it at **position 2**.\n    *   The ethyl and the other methyl group are on **position 3**.\n    *   The full substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH (a strong base).\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a **Michael Addition**. The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile and Product Structure**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, creating the nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The resulting product's structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n3.  **Careful Point 4: IUPAC Naming of Product B**. To name the product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   Numbering must start from the nitrile carbon as C1: `N≡C(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The longest chain has **six carbons**, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. It is a common mistake to misidentify a shorter chain.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct IUPAC names:\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (**Incorrect name for A**), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct name for B**)\n*   **B)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (**Incorrect name for A**), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (**Incorrect name for B**)\n*   **C)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (**Correct name for A**), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (**Incorrect name for B**)\n*   **D)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (**Correct name for A**), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct name for B**)\n\nThe only option that contains the correct names for both products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\nThe problem requires determining the major products of two separate chemical reactions and selecting the option that provides the correct IUPAC names for both. The reactions are both examples of Michael additions.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> Product A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. A strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most critical step for determining the structure of Product A. The ketone has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and therefore cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The α-carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. This makes the reaction completely regioselective, with the nucleophilic attack originating from C6.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. To name the resulting product, we must follow IUPAC priority rules, where the ester group is higher priority than the ketone.\n    *   The molecule is named as a substituted **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name this complex substituent, numbering of the ring begins at its point of attachment. The original C6 carbon is now **position 1'**. This position has a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering continues to give the `oxo` (=O) group the lowest possible number, placing it at **position 2'**.\n    *   This numbering scheme places the ethyl and the other methyl group at **position 3'**.\n    *   Assembling the name alphabetically gives the substituent: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full, correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> Product B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The protons on the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Nucleophile Formation and Attack**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form the nucleophile, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n3.  **Careful Point 4: IUPAC Naming and Parent Chain Identification**. The final structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 must be identified: `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The parent chain is six carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**. An incorrect analysis might identify a shorter butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full, correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the thorough analysis:\n*   The correct name for **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   The correct name for **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nWe now compare this result to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   The name for A is **Correct**.\n    *   The name for B is **Correct**.\n*   **B)** The name for B is incorrect (`...nitrobutanenitrile` identifies the wrong parent chain).\n*   **C)** The name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...` incorrectly numbers the substituent ring).\n*   **D)** The names for both A and B are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option that contains the correct IUPAC names for both products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → Product A\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: The reaction involves a ketone, a strong base, and an α,β-unsaturated ester. This is a **Michael Addition**. The base (t-BuOK) generates a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated system of ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step for determining the product's structure. The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl): C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at **C2** is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated by the base.\n    *   The carbon at **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. This is not a matter of kinetic vs. thermodynamic control; it is the only chemically possible outcome. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, with C6 becoming the nucleophilic atom.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The nucleophilic C6 atom attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. For naming, the ester functional group has a higher priority than the ketone, so the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the complex cyclohexanone substituent, its point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **position 1**. This carbon has a methyl group.\n    *   The ring is then numbered to give the carbonyl (`=O`) group the lowest possible locant, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   The carbon bearing the ethyl and the second methyl group is now at **position 3**.\n    *   The complete name for the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The final, correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → Product B\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a **Michael Addition**. The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, forming a nucleophilic carbanion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 3: Parent Chain Identification and Naming**. The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The nitrile (`-CN`) is the principal functional group, so its carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 is six carbons long: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`. An error here would be to misidentify the chain length and name it as a derivative of butanenitrile.\n    *   The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The final, correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the thorough analysis:\n*   **Correct Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Correct Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nWe now compare these correct names to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) Name for A is incorrect (`...4-oxocyclohexyl...`), and Name for B is incorrect (`...butanenitrile`).\n*   B) Name for A is incorrect, and Name for B is correct.\n*   C) Name for A is correct, but Name for B is incorrect.\n*   **D) Name for A is correct, AND Name for B is correct.**\n\nThe only option that correctly names both major products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, based on a consensus of chemical principles from the candidate answers and a rigorous evaluation of the problem.\n\nThe problem asks for the major products of two separate reactions and to select the option with the correct IUPAC names for both. Both are Michael addition reactions.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n**Reaction**: `2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A`\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The strong base (t-BuOK) forms a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which then adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Enolate Formation**. This is the most crucial step for determining the structure of Product A. The base must abstract a proton from a carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl group. We must inspect the two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen). It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The reaction is therefore completely regioselective, forming a single enolate with C6 as the nucleophilic atom.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: IUPAC Naming of Product A**. The nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. For naming, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. The molecule is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the complex substituent ring, numbering begins at its point of attachment (the original C6). This becomes **position 1** of the substituent, which bears a methyl group.\n    *   The ring is then numbered to give the oxo (=O) group the lowest possible locant, placing it at **position 2**.\n    *   This places the ethyl and the second methyl group at **position 3**.\n    *   Assembling the name for the substituent gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The correct name for Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n**Reaction**: `1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B`\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The α-protons of a nitroalkane are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing nitro group.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 3: Parent Chain Identification and Naming**. The nucleophile formed from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile, yielding the structure `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the highest priority functional group, the nitrile (`-CN`). Numbering starts at the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   The longest chain is 6 carbons long: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`. An error here would be to misidentify the parent chain as a butanenitrile.\n    *   The parent name is therefore **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The correct name for Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined the correct names for the products:\n*   **Product A**: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B**: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nNow, we must compare these correct names against the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n    *   Name for A is **Correct**.\n    *   Name for B is **Correct**.\n*   **B)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n    *   Name for A is Incorrect (wrong numbering of the ring).\n*   **C)** A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n    *   Name for A is Incorrect.
