The mechanism for this decay is two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay process that proceeds through an intermediate quantum state.\n\nThe entire process is governed by the well-established **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** The orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` must change by exactly $\\pm 1$. The parity of the state must change.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** The magnetic quantum number `m` can change by $0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the atom releases energy, so its principal quantum number `n` must decrease in each step ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n**Careful Point 1: A Direct Transition is Forbidden.**\nIt is crucial to first note that a direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is not possible. For such a transition, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process described.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\n\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We must determine the quantum numbers ($n', l', m'$) of the intermediate state by applying the selection rules to both steps.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since energy must decrease, the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) gives $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Since energy must also decrease in this step, $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Uniquely Identifying the Intermediate `n` value.**\nBy combining the energy constraints from both steps, we have $1 < n' < 3$. Since `n` must be an integer, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. Thus, the decay must proceed through one of the $2p$ orbitals. The three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all routes listed in the options are physically plausible pathways. The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\n\nThe \"probability\" here refers to the branching ratio for a specific cascade path. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only decay channel to a lower energy state allowed by E1 selection rules is the transition to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available pathway, this transition occurs with certainty.\n    **Careful Point 3:** The probability for this second step is therefore 1.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n    **Careful Point 4 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. S-states are **spherically symmetric**, which means they have no preferred orientation in space. Because the initial state is symmetric and spontaneous emission (in the absence of external fields) is an isotropic process, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate `2p` state. Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of the atom decaying into any *single specific* one of these channels is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision by Evaluating the Options\n\nOur analysis concludes that any valid cascade route must proceed through a $2p$ state and has a total probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We now examine the provided options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n    *   The probability is incorrect, and the initial state is missing (a typo).\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   The transition route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, a unanimous and clear consensus on the physical reasoning emerges. The solution is derived through the following logical steps, highlighting the key physical principles involved.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as a two-step cascade involving two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. The entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one unit.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can stay the same or change by one unit.\n*   **Δn < 0**: The principal quantum number must decrease at each step for a spontaneous decay (emission), as the atom loses energy.\n\n**Careful Point 1: A two-step process is mandatory.**\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ would involve a change in orbital angular momentum of Δl = 0 - 0 = 0. This violates the selection rule that Δl must be ±1. Therefore, a direct E1 transition is forbidden, confirming the necessity of a two-step cascade.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the decay route be $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We must identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ by applying the selection rules to both steps.\n\n*   **For Step 1 (from |3,0,0⟩):**\n    *   The initial state has l=0. The Δl = ±1 rule requires the intermediate state to have **l'=1**.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so **n' < 3**.\n    *   The initial state has m=0. The Δm = 0, ±1 rule allows the intermediate state to have **m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}**.\n*   **For Step 2 (to |1,0,0⟩):**\n    *   The final state has l=0. A transition from an intermediate state with l'=1 is allowed, as Δl = 0 - 1 = -1.\n    *   The energy must decrease again, so **n' > 1**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Uniquely identifying the intermediate energy level.**\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number from both steps gives **1 < n' < 3**. Since n' must be an integer, the only possibility is **n'=2**. This means the decay must proceed through the n=2, l=1 (the 2p) energy level. Consequently, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes shown in the options are, therefore, physically possible pathways. The decision must hinge on the calculated probability.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route**\n\nThe total probability for the atom to follow one specific path is the product of the probabilities of each step: P(total) = P(Step 1) × P(Step 2).\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the probability of the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$ for one specific value of m'.\n    \n    **Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` (l=0) and is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, spontaneous emission from such a state is isotropic (the same in all directions). This means the atom is **equally likely** to transition into any of the three available, degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate 2p state. Since there are three equally probable and mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** This is the probability of the transition $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only decay channel to a lower energy state that is allowed by the E1 selection rules is the one to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path available, this transition occurs with certainty. The probability (or branching ratio) for this second step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nThe analysis shows that any of the three valid cascade routes has a total probability of 1/3. We must find the option that correctly states both a valid route and this probability. Let's examine the options from the problem statement:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n\nComparing our result with these options:\n*   Option A presents a valid path and the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   Options B and C present valid paths but incorrect probabilities.\n*   Option D has an incorrect probability and a typo.\n\nThus, option A is the only correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the physical principles and the resulting calculation. The variation in the final letter choices among the candidates is simply due to the different ordering of the options they were presented with. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s orbital) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state). The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe process is governed by the well-established **E1 selection rules**:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**.\n*   For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, meaning the principal quantum number **$n$ must decrease** at each step.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** A direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. For such a hypothetical transition, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms that a two-step process is required.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay must proceed via an intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nWe can find the quantum numbers of the intermediate state by applying the selection rules to both steps:\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   Initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have **$l'=1$**.\n    *   Initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have **$m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$**.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so **$n' < 3$**.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Energy must also decrease in this step, so **$n' > 1$**.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number from both steps ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value for the intermediate state's principal quantum number is **$n'=2$**. Therefore, the intermediate state must be one of the three 2p sublevels: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all transition *routes* shown in the options are physically plausible. The deciding factor must be the probability.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route**\n\nThe probability of the atom following one specific path is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n$P(\\text{total route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the probability of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying into one *specific* intermediate sublevel, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an **s-state**. A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. They have no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions, in the absence of external fields). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate 2p state. Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **$\\frac{1}{3}$**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** This is the probability of the atom decaying from the intermediate state, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$, to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. As this is the only available decay channel, this transition occurs with certainty. Therefore, the probability for this second step is **$P(\\text{step 2}) = 1$**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{total route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options and Conclude**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer must pair a physically valid transition route with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We examine the provided options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle  and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n    *   This option has a typo, but the route is otherwise valid. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly describes a possible physical process with its corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning presented across all the provided candidate answers to arrive at a definitive conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial excited state, $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, to the final ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is explicitly stated as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means the decay is a cascade process that must pass through an intermediate state.\n\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, which in the non-relativistic model means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease at each step.\n\nA crucial first step, as noted by all candidates, is to recognize that a direct one-step transition is forbidden.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Forbidden Direct Transition.** A direct jump from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ would involve a change in the orbital angular momentum of $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$. This violates the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, confirming the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's call the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ and determine its properties using the selection rules.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   Since the initial state has $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   Since the initial state has $m=0$, the rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l=0$, which is an allowed transition from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ (as $\\Delta l = -1$).\n    *   Energy must decrease again, so the intermediate state's principal quantum number $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying the Intermediate State's Principal Quantum Number.** By combining the energy constraints from both steps ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible intermediate states are the three degenerate sublevels of the 2p orbital: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means all the routes shown in the options are physically plausible paths.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe question asks for the probability (more accurately, the branching ratio) of one specific path.

It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission is isotropic (the same in all directions, in the absence of external fields). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability for any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Uniqueness of the Second Step.** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only possible decay path to a lower energy state that is allowed by the E1 selection rules is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4.

The solution can be broken down into the following step-by-step analysis, highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state. The process can be schematically represented as:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**.\n*   For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, which means the principal quantum number **$n$ must decrease** at each step.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Forbidden Direct Transition**\nA direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. For such a hypothetical transition, the change in the orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, which violates the $\\Delta l=\\pm1$ rule. This confirms that the two-step process described is necessary.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nWe must apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, which we will call $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l=\\pm1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$.

S-states are **spherically symmetric** and have no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the process of spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is **equally likely** to decay into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.

The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a two-step cascade decay through an intermediate state.\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum Change ($\\Delta l$)**: The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number Change ($\\Delta m$)**: The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Energy Change ($\\Delta n$)**: For a spontaneous decay, the atom loses energy, which in the non-relativistic H-atom means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Forbidden Transition**: A direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. For such a jump, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's denote the intermediate state by $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ and apply the selection rules to both steps.\n\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition is from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$), giving $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The energy must decrease again in this step, so the intermediate state's principal quantum number $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Uniqueness of n'**: By combining the energy constraints from both steps, we find $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. This definitively means the intermediate state must be one of the 2p orbitals.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability, or branching ratio, for the atom to follow one specific path is the product of the probabilities of each step. This calculation is the core of the problem.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable and mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Certainty of the Second Step**: Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path available, this transition occurs with certainty. Therefore, its probability is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer must pair a physically valid transition route with a probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the options provided in the original question:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   **D) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The route is valid (assuming a typo), but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with the physical principles is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a comprehensive synthesis of the candidate answers, all of which agree on the core physical principles, the problem can be solved with the following step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules.**\n    The problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay passing through an intermediate state. The process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in principal quantum number for decay: $n$ must decrease at each step.\n\n2.  **Check if a Direct Transition is Possible.**\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ would involve a change in orbital angular momentum of $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This violates the E1 selection rule ($\\Delta l=\\pm1$), making a direct transition forbidden.

We must determine the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **For Step 1:** The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. Since $n$ must decrease, $n'<3$. The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **For Step 2:** The final state has $l=0$. A transition from an intermediate state with $l'=1$ gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed. Since $n$ must decrease again, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$) requires that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible intermediate states are the three degenerate sublevels of the 2p orbital: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, \\text{and } |2,1,1\\rangle$.

It has no preferred orientation in space. Due to this symmetry, the spontaneous decay process is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices (`A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`) across the candidate answers are due to the different randomization of options presented to each agent, but the physical reasoning is identical and sound. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the provided question options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state). This is not a direct decay but occurs via two consecutive **electric dipole (E1) transitions**, implying a two-step cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n$$ |3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle $$\n\nThis process is strictly governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum:** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number:** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Energy:** For a spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy. In the non-relativistic H-atom, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is **forbidden**. For such a transition, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be denoted by $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We can determine its quantum numbers by applying the selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n\n*   **For Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n', l', m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **For Step 2 ($|n', l', m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   A transition from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$ is allowed, as this gives $\\Delta l = -1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease again, so the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number `n'` from both steps ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Thus, the intermediate state must have quantum numbers $n'=2, l'=1$. The three possible intermediate states are the degenerate sublevels of the 2p orbital: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, \\text{and } |2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe question asks for the probability (or branching ratio) of one specific path. This is calculated as the product of the probabilities of each step in the cascade.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (The Key Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an **s-state** ($l=0$) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because the initial state is symmetric and spontaneous emission is an isotropic process (in the absence of external fields), the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate 2p state.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ intermediate states, its only possible decay path to a lower energy state that satisfies the E1 selection rules is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single specific route is the product:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nOur analysis concludes that any valid decay path has a probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The transition route is valid, and the probability is correct. **This is the correct answer.**\n\n*   **B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The probability is incorrect (and there is a typo). The probability of transitioning to *any* of the three 2p states combined is 1, but this option incorrectly states the probability for a single path.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the reasoning provided by all candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the underlying physics and calculation. The variations in the final letter choices among the agents are due to the different orderings of options presented to each one, but the physical conclusion is identical in all cases.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis incorporating the careful points identified.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial excited state, $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, to the final ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism for this decay is two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means the process is a cascade decay that must proceed through an intermediate state.\n\nThe entire process is governed by the well-established **E1 selection rules**:\n*   **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a spontaneous decay, the atom loses energy, so `n` must decrease in each step ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n**Careful Point 1: A Direct Transition is Forbidden.**\nA crucial starting point, correctly identified by all agents, is that a direct single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. For such a transition, the change in the orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process described in the question.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We must find the allowed quantum numbers for the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   A transition from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) is allowed, as $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$.\n    *   Energy must decrease in this step as well, so the intermediate state's principal quantum number $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Intermediate State is a 2p Orbital.**\nCombining the energy constraints from both steps gives $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. Thus, the intermediate state must be one of the three `2p` states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means all transition *routes* shown in the options are physically plausible pathways, so the decision must hinge on the probability.\n\n**3.

Since this is the only path available, the transition occurs with certainty. Therefore, the probability for this second step is $P_2 = 1$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($P_1$):** This is the probability of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to one specific intermediate sublevel (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$).\n\n**Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight): The initial state is spherically symmetric.**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is **equally likely** to decay into each of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate `2p` state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally probable and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4.

This is a crucial starting point. The electric dipole selection rules, which govern these transitions, require that the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. A direct transition would have $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, making it forbidden and confirming the necessity of a two-step process.\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n1.  **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Change in Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the atom loses energy, so `n` must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have **$l'=1$**.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have **$m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$**.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so **$n' < 3$**.\n\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition from the intermediate state (with $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Energy must decrease in this step as well, so **$n' > 1$**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Pinpointing the Intermediate Energy Level**\nCombining the energy constraints from both steps gives **$1 < n' < 3$**. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is **$n'=2$**. This means the intermediate state must be one of the **2p** states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition *routes* shown in the options are, therefore, physically plausible. The decision must hinge on the associated probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route\n\nThe total probability for the atom to follow one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($P_2$):** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path, the transition happens with certainty. Thus, the probability for this second step is **$P_2 = 1$**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($P_1$):** This is the probability of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to one specific sublevel, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    **Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. `s-states` are **spherically symmetric**, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **$\\frac{1}{3}$**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Conclude\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer must pair a physically valid transition route with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

This is not a direct decay but happens via two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Principal Quantum Number ($n$):** For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the atom loses energy, so `n` must decrease in each step ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nWe must identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, by applying the selection rules to the two-step process: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Why a two-step process is necessary.** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ would involve a change in orbital angular momentum of $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$. This violates the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, making the direct, single-photon decay forbidden. This confirms the necessity of a two-step cascade.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n', l', m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$.

The different letter choices from the candidates are simply due to the options being presented in a different order. The following is a consolidated step-by-step analysis incorporating all the critical points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial excited state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n$$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$$\nThe process is governed by the well-established **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  For spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy, which means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease at each step ($n_{\\text{final}} < n_{\\text{initial}}$).\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Transition Must Be a Two-Step Process**\nA direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is **forbidden**. This is because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number would be $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, which violates the $\\Delta l=\\pm1$ selection rule. This confirms the necessity of the cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nWe can identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, by applying the selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be less than 3.\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   A transition from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) is allowed, as it gives $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$.\n    *   Energy must decrease in this step as well, so $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Identifying the Intermediate Level**\nCombining the energy constraints from both steps gives the condition $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. Therefore, the intermediate state must be a `2p` orbital ($n'=2, l'=1$). All routes presented in the options, involving $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are physically plausible paths. The decision must therefore be made based on the probability.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route**\n\nThe probability for the atom to follow one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the probability of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to one specific sublevel, for example, $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` ($l=0$). A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. They have no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because of this symmetry, the spontaneous emission process is **isotropic** (the same in all directions), assuming no external fields. This means the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Probability of Step 2:**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: The second step is a certainty.** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available path, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Conclude**\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer must pair a physically valid transition route with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's examine the options from the original prompt.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   C) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle  and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n    *   This option is malformed. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly describes a possible physical process with its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning presented across all the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem asks for a valid decay pathway and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe decay is a two-step cascade process, governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous emission, the atom loses energy, so the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease at each step ($n_{\\text{final}} < n_{\\text{initial}}$).\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay proceeds as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   This transition from an intermediate state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$ gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease again, so the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\nBy combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. The full set of possible intermediate states, according to all the selection rules, are therefore $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All the pathways listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe probability for a single cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step. This is the crucial part of the analysis.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle \\text{ for a specific } m')$\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$) and is spherically symmetric.

The probability is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options and Conclude**\n\nThe analysis shows that any of the valid cascade routes, such as $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, has a probability of 1/3.

The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. **This option presents a valid route and the correct probability.**\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules, as $\\Delta l = 0$. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The intermediate state must be a `2p` orbital ($n=2, l=1$). Other states like `2s` or `1p` are not possible; the `2s` state would lead to a forbidden $\\Delta l=0$ transition in the second step, and `1p` does not exist.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The crucial physical insight is the spherical symmetry of the initial `3s` state. This symmetry dictates that the decay is isotropic, meaning the probability is split equally among the three possible `m'` sublevels of the `2p` state. The probability for the first step is therefore 1/3 for any single channel.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The probability of the second step is 1 because from the `2p` state, the `1s` state is the *only* lower-energy destination allowed by E1 selection rules.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nA comprehensive analysis of the problem reveals a consensus on the underlying physics. The solution can be broken down into a series of logical steps, highlighting the key physical principles involved.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a two-step cascade decay through an intermediate state. The process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, so `n` must decrease in each step.\n\n**Careful Point 1: A two-step process is necessary.** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. For such a transition, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the decay must proceed via an intermediate state.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\n\nLet the intermediate state be denoted by $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade decay: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first step:** The transition is from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($l=0, m=0$) to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have **$l' = 1$**.\n    *   The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have **$m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$**.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so **$n' < 3$**.\n\n*   **For the second step:** The transition is from $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($l=0, m=0$).\n    *   The transition from $l'=1$ to $l=0$ gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so **$n' > 1$**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The intermediate state is a 2p orbital.** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value for the intermediate state is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition *routes* listed in the options are physically plausible. The deciding factor must be the associated probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\n\nThe overall probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to follow one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($P_2$):** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state.\n    **Careful Point 3: The second step occurs with certainty.** Since this is the only available decay path, the transition happens with a probability of **1**. So, $P_2 = 1$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($P_1$):** This is the probability of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to one specific intermediate sublevel, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    **Careful Point 4: The crucial concept is spherical symmetry.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. S-states are **spherically symmetric**, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$. So, $P_1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any single specific route is the product:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Conclude\n\nBased on our analysis, any of the valid cascade routes has a total probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay passing through an intermediate state. The process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   Change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   Change in principal quantum number for decay: $n$ must decrease at each step.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We must determine the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: A two-step process is mandatory.**\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ would involve a change in orbital angular momentum of $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$. This violates the E1 selection rule ($\\Delta l=\\pm1$), making a direct transition forbidden. This confirms the necessity of a two-step cascade process.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 1 and Step 2:**\n    *   For the first step from $|3,0,0\\rangle$, since $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$. The rule that $n$ must decrease requires $n'<3$.\n    *   For the second step to $|1,0,0\\rangle$, a transition from a state with $l'=1$ is allowed since $\\Delta l = -1$. The rule that $n$ must decrease requires the intermediate state to have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The intermediate state is a 2p orbital.**\n    Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$) requires that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. The selection rule on $m$ for the first step ($m_{initial}=0$) allows $m'$ to be $-1, 0, \\text{or } 1$. Therefore, the only possible intermediate states are the three degenerate sublevels of the 2p orbital: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, \\text{and } |2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**3.

It has no preferred orientation in space. Due to this symmetry, the spontaneous decay process is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.

The mechanism for this decay is two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay process that proceeds through an intermediate quantum state.\n\nThe entire process is governed by the well-established **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** The orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` must change by exactly $\\pm 1$. The parity of the state must change.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** The magnetic quantum number `m` can change by $0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the atom releases energy, so its principal quantum number `n` must decrease in each step ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n**Careful Point 1: A Direct Transition is Forbidden.**\nIt is crucial to first note that a direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is not possible. For such a transition, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process described.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\n\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We must determine the quantum numbers ($n', l', m'$) of the intermediate state by applying the selection rules to both steps.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since energy must decrease, the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) gives $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Since energy must also decrease in this step, $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Uniquely Identifying the Intermediate `n` value.**\nBy combining the energy constraints from both steps, we have $1 < n' < 3$. Since `n` must be an integer, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. Thus, the decay must proceed through one of the $2p$ orbitals. The three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all routes listed in the options are physically plausible pathways.

Since this is the only available pathway, this transition occurs with certainty.\n    **Careful Point 3:** The probability for this second step is therefore 1.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n    **Careful Point 4 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. S-states are **spherically symmetric**, which means they have no preferred orientation in space. Because the initial state is symmetric and spontaneous emission (in the absence of external fields) is an isotropic process, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate `2p` state. Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of the atom decaying into any *single specific* one of these channels is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision by Evaluating the Options\n\nOur analysis concludes that any valid cascade route must proceed through a $2p$ state and has a total probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

The solution is derived through the following logical steps, highlighting the key physical principles involved.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as a two-step cascade involving two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. The entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one unit.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can stay the same or change by one unit.\n*   **Δn < 0**: The principal quantum number must decrease at each step for a spontaneous decay (emission), as the atom loses energy.\n\n**Careful Point 1: A two-step process is mandatory.**\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ would involve a change in orbital angular momentum of Δl = 0 - 0 = 0. This violates the selection rule that Δl must be ±1. Therefore, a direct E1 transition is forbidden, confirming the necessity of a two-step cascade.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the decay route be $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We must identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ by applying the selection rules to both steps.\n\n*   **For Step 1 (from |3,0,0⟩):**\n    *   The initial state has l=0. The Δl = ±1 rule requires the intermediate state to have **l'=1**.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so **n' < 3**.\n    *   The initial state has m=0. The Δm = 0, ±1 rule allows the intermediate state to have **m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}**.\n*   **For Step 2 (to |1,0,0⟩):**\n    *   The final state has l=0. A transition from an intermediate state with l'=1 is allowed, as Δl = 0 - 1 = -1.\n    *   The energy must decrease again, so **n' > 1**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Uniquely identifying the intermediate energy level.**\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number from both steps gives **1 < n' < 3**. Since n' must be an integer, the only possibility is **n'=2**. This means the decay must proceed through the n=2, l=1 (the 2p) energy level. Consequently, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes shown in the options are, therefore, physically possible pathways. The decision must hinge on the calculated probability.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route**\n\nThe total probability for the atom to follow one specific path is the product of the probabilities of each step: P(total) = P(Step 1) × P(Step 2).\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the probability of the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$ for one specific value of m'.\n    \n    **Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` (l=0) and is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, spontaneous emission from such a state is isotropic (the same in all directions). This means the atom is **equally likely** to transition into any of the three available, degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate 2p state. Since there are three equally probable and mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** This is the probability of the transition $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only decay channel to a lower energy state that is allowed by the E1 selection rules is the one to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path available, this transition occurs with certainty. The probability (or branching ratio) for this second step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nThe analysis shows that any of the three valid cascade routes has a total probability of 1/3. We must find the option that correctly states both a valid route and this probability. Let's examine the options from the problem statement:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n\nComparing our result with these options:\n*   Option A presents a valid path and the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   Options B and C present valid paths but incorrect probabilities.\n*   Option D has an incorrect probability and a typo.\n\nThus, option A is the only correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the physical principles and the resulting calculation. The variation in the final letter choices among the candidates is simply due to the different ordering of the options they were presented with. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s orbital) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state). The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe process is governed by the well-established **E1 selection rules**:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**.\n*   For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, meaning the principal quantum number **$n$ must decrease** at each step.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** A direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. For such a hypothetical transition, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms that a two-step process is required.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay must proceed via an intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nWe can find the quantum numbers of the intermediate state by applying the selection rules to both steps:\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   Initial state has $l=0$.

A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. They have no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions, in the absence of external fields). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate 2p state. Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **$\\frac{1}{3}$**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** This is the probability of the atom decaying from the intermediate state, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$, to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state.

Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial excited state, $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, to the final ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is explicitly stated as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means the decay is a cascade process that must pass through an intermediate state.\n\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, which in the non-relativistic model means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease at each step.\n\nA crucial first step, as noted by all candidates, is to recognize that a direct one-step transition is forbidden.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Forbidden Direct Transition.** A direct jump from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ would involve a change in the orbital angular momentum of $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$. This violates the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, confirming the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's call the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ and determine its properties using the selection rules.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   Since the initial state has $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   Since the initial state has $m=0$, the rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l=0$, which is an allowed transition from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ (as $\\Delta l = -1$).\n    *   Energy must decrease again, so the intermediate state's principal quantum number $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying the Intermediate State's Principal Quantum Number.** By combining the energy constraints from both steps ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible intermediate states are the three degenerate sublevels of the 2p orbital: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means all the routes shown in the options are physically plausible paths.\n\n**3.

It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission is isotropic (the same in all directions, in the absence of external fields). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability for any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Uniqueness of the Second Step.** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only possible decay path to a lower energy state that is allowed by the E1 selection rules is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state.

The solution can be broken down into the following step-by-step analysis, highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state. The process can be schematically represented as:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**.\n*   For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, which means the principal quantum number **$n$ must decrease** at each step.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Forbidden Direct Transition**\nA direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. For such a hypothetical transition, the change in the orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, which violates the $\\Delta l=\\pm1$ rule. This confirms that the two-step process described is necessary.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nWe must apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, which we will call $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l=\\pm1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta m=0, \\pm1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since this is a decay process, the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) is allowed, as it gives $\\Delta l = 0-1=-1$.\n    *   Since energy must also decrease in this step, the principal quantum number $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Pinpointing the Intermediate Level**\nBy combining the energy constraints from both steps, we have $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. This means the intermediate state must be one of the $n=2, l=1$ (or 2p) states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All the transition *routes* shown in the options are, therefore, physically plausible pathways. The decision must be based on the associated probability.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe probability for the atom to follow one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($P_1$)**: This is the probability of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to one *specific* magnetic sublevel of the 2p state (e.g., to $|2,1,0\\rangle$).\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Concept)**: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. S-states are **spherically symmetric** and have no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the process of spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is **equally likely** to decay into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable and mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($P_2$)**: Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path available, the transition occurs with certainty. Thus, the probability for this second step is **$P_2 = 1$**.\n\n*   **Total Probability**: The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options and Conclude**\n\nOur analysis shows that any of the three valid decay routes has a total probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the options provided in the original question prompt:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: This option has a typo.

The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a two-step cascade decay through an intermediate state.\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum Change ($\\Delta l$)**: The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number Change ($\\Delta m$)**: The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Energy Change ($\\Delta n$)**: For a spontaneous decay, the atom loses energy, which in the non-relativistic H-atom means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Forbidden Transition**: A direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. For such a jump, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's denote the intermediate state by $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ and apply the selection rules to both steps.\n\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition is from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$), giving $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The energy must decrease again in this step, so the intermediate state's principal quantum number $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Uniqueness of n'**: By combining the energy constraints from both steps, we find $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. This definitively means the intermediate state must be one of the 2p orbitals.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability, or branching ratio, for the atom to follow one specific path is the product of the probabilities of each step. This calculation is the core of the problem.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable and mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Certainty of the Second Step**: Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path available, this transition occurs with certainty. Therefore, its probability is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer must pair a physically valid transition route with a probability of 1/3.

The following is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the provided question options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state). This is not a direct decay but occurs via two consecutive **electric dipole (E1) transitions**, implying a two-step cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n$$ |3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle $$\n\nThis process is strictly governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum:** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number:** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Energy:** For a spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy. In the non-relativistic H-atom, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is **forbidden**. For such a transition, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be denoted by $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We can determine its quantum numbers by applying the selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n\n*   **For Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n', l', m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **For Step 2 ($|n', l', m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   A transition from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$ is allowed, as this gives $\\Delta l = -1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease again, so the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number `n'` from both steps ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Thus, the intermediate state must have quantum numbers $n'=2, l'=1$. The three possible intermediate states are the degenerate sublevels of the 2p orbital: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, \\text{and } |2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe question asks for the probability (or branching ratio) of one specific path. This is calculated as the product of the probabilities of each step in the cascade.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (The Key Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an **s-state** ($l=0$) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because the initial state is symmetric and spontaneous emission is an isotropic process (in the absence of external fields), the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate 2p state.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ intermediate states, its only possible decay path to a lower energy state that satisfies the E1 selection rules is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single specific route is the product:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nOur analysis concludes that any valid decay path has a probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The transition route is valid, and the probability is correct. **This is the correct answer.**\n\n*   **B) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The probability is incorrect (and there is a typo). The probability of transitioning to *any* of the three 2p states combined is 1, but this option incorrectly states the probability for a single path.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the reasoning provided by all candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the underlying physics and calculation. The variations in the final letter choices among the agents are due to the different orderings of options presented to each one, but the physical conclusion is identical in all cases.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis incorporating the careful points identified.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial excited state, $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, to the final ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism for this decay is two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means the process is a cascade decay that must proceed through an intermediate state.\n\nThe entire process is governed by the well-established **E1 selection rules**:\n*   **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a spontaneous decay, the atom loses energy, so `n` must decrease in each step ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n**Careful Point 1: A Direct Transition is Forbidden.**\nA crucial starting point, correctly identified by all agents, is that a direct single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. For such a transition, the change in the orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process described in the question.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We must find the allowed quantum numbers for the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   A transition from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) is allowed, as $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$.\n    *   Energy must decrease in this step as well, so the intermediate state's principal quantum number $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Intermediate State is a 2p Orbital.**\nCombining the energy constraints from both steps gives $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. Thus, the intermediate state must be one of the three `2p` states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means all transition *routes* shown in the options are physically plausible pathways, so the decision must hinge on the probability.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route**\n\nThe total probability for the atom to follow one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($P_2$):** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path available, the transition occurs with certainty. Therefore, the probability for this second step is $P_2 = 1$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($P_1$):** This is the probability of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to one specific intermediate sublevel (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$).\n\n**Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight): The initial state is spherically symmetric.**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is **equally likely** to decay into each of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate `2p` state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally probable and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options and Conclude**\n\nThe physical analysis shows that any of the valid cascade routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We now evaluate the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n    *   The probability is incorrect (and there is a typo in the initial state).\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly describes a possible physical process with its corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a comprehensive synthesis of the candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous agreement on the underlying physics. The solution can be broken down into the following step-by-step analysis, highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a cascade decay via an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Careful Point 1: Forbidden Direct Transition**\nA direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. This is a crucial starting point. The electric dipole selection rules, which govern these transitions, require that the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. A direct transition would have $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, making it forbidden and confirming the necessity of a two-step process.\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n1.  **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Change in Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the atom loses energy, so `n` must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have **$l'=1$**.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have **$m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$**.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so **$n' < 3$**.\n\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition from the intermediate state (with $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Energy must decrease in this step as well, so **$n' > 1$**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Pinpointing the Intermediate Energy Level**\nCombining the energy constraints from both steps gives **$1 < n' < 3$**. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is **$n'=2$**. This means the intermediate state must be one of the **2p** states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition *routes* shown in the options are, therefore, physically plausible. The decision must hinge on the associated probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route\n\nThe total probability for the atom to follow one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($P_2$):** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path, the transition happens with certainty. Thus, the probability for this second step is **$P_2 = 1$**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($P_1$):** This is the probability of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to one specific sublevel, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    **Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. `s-states` are **spherically symmetric**, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **$\\frac{1}{3}$**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Conclude\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer must pair a physically valid transition route with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's examine the given choices:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and \\frac{1}{3}**\n    *   The route is valid, and the probability is correct. **This is the correct answer.**\n\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and \\frac{1}{4}**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and \\frac{1}{4}**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle  and \\frac{2}{3}**\n    *   This option has a typo, and the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly describes a possible physical process with its corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial physical principles involved.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (1s ground state). This is not a direct decay but happens via two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Principal Quantum Number ($n$):** For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the atom loses energy, so `n` must decrease in each step ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nWe must identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, by applying the selection rules to the two-step process: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Why a two-step process is necessary.** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ would involve a change in orbital angular momentum of $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$.

The different letter choices from the candidates are simply due to the options being presented in a different order. The following is a consolidated step-by-step analysis incorporating all the critical points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial excited state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n$$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$$\nThe process is governed by the well-established **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  For spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy, which means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease at each step ($n_{\\text{final}} < n_{\\text{initial}}$).\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Transition Must Be a Two-Step Process**\nA direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is **forbidden**. This is because the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number would be $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, which violates the $\\Delta l=\\pm1$ selection rule. This confirms the necessity of the cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nWe can identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, by applying the selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be less than 3.\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   A transition from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) is allowed, as it gives $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$.\n    *   Energy must decrease in this step as well, so $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Identifying the Intermediate Level**\nCombining the energy constraints from both steps gives the condition $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. Therefore, the intermediate state must be a `2p` orbital ($n'=2, l'=1$). All routes presented in the options, involving $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are physically plausible paths. The decision must therefore be made based on the probability.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route**\n\nThe probability for the atom to follow one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** This is the probability of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to one specific sublevel, for example, $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` ($l=0$). A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. They have no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because of this symmetry, the spontaneous emission process is **isotropic** (the same in all directions), assuming no external fields. This means the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Probability of Step 2:**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: The second step is a certainty.** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available path, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Conclude**\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer must pair a physically valid transition route with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe decay is a two-step cascade process, governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous emission, the atom loses energy, so the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease at each step ($n_{\\text{final}} < n_{\\text{initial}}$).\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay proceeds as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   This transition from an intermediate state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$ gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease again, so the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\nBy combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. The full set of possible intermediate states, according to all the selection rules, are therefore $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All the pathways listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe probability for a single cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step. This is the crucial part of the analysis.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle \\text{ for a specific } m')$\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state ($l=0$) and is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, the atom does not have a preferred direction for emitting a photon. The decay is isotropic.\n    *   This means the atom is **equally likely** to decay into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of the decay proceeding through any **single specific** channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    *   Once the atom is in a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, the only possible E1 decay path to a lower energy is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state.\n    *   Since this is the only available decay channel, this transition occurs with certainty. The probability is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options and Conclude**\n\nThe analysis shows that any of the valid cascade routes, such as $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, has a probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. **This option presents a valid route and the correct probability.**\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules, as $\\Delta l = 0$. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The intermediate state must be a `2p` orbital ($n=2, l=1$). Other states like `2s` or `1p` are not possible; the `2s` state would lead to a forbidden $\\Delta l=0$ transition in the second step, and `1p` does not exist.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The crucial physical insight is the spherical symmetry of the initial `3s` state. This symmetry dictates that the decay is isotropic, meaning the probability is split equally among the three possible `m'` sublevels of the `2p` state. The probability for the first step is therefore 1/3 for any single channel.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The probability of the second step is 1 because from the `2p` state, the `1s` state is the *only* lower-energy destination allowed by E1 selection rules.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nA comprehensive analysis of the problem reveals a consensus on the underlying physics. The solution can be broken down into a series of logical steps, highlighting the key physical principles involved.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a two-step cascade decay through an intermediate state. The process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, so `n` must decrease in each step.\n\n**Careful Point 1: A two-step process is necessary.** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. For such a transition, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the decay must proceed via an intermediate state.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\n\nLet the intermediate state be denoted by $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade decay: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first step:** The transition is from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($l=0, m=0$) to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have **$l' = 1$**.\n    *   The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have **$m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$**.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so **$n' < 3$**.\n\n*   **For the second step:** The transition is from $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($l=0, m=0$).\n    *   The transition from $l'=1$ to $l=0$ gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so **$n' > 1$**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The intermediate state is a 2p orbital.** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value for the intermediate state is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition *routes* listed in the options are physically plausible. The deciding factor must be the associated probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\n\nThe overall probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to follow one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($P_2$):** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state.\n    **Careful Point 3: The second step occurs with certainty.** Since this is the only available decay path, the transition happens with a probability of **1**. So, $P_2 = 1$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($P_1$):** This is the probability of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to one specific intermediate sublevel, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    **Careful Point 4: The crucial concept is spherical symmetry.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. S-states are **spherically symmetric**, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$. So, $P_1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any single specific route is the product:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Conclude\n\nBased on our analysis, any of the valid cascade routes has a total probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We now examine the given options to find the one that correctly pairs a valid route with this probability.\n\n*   A) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches the physical and mathematical analysis is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n    The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay via an intermediate state. The process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n    *   **Orbital Angular Momentum Change ($\\Delta l$):** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   **Magnetic Quantum Number Change ($\\Delta m$):** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   **Energy Conservation ($\\Delta n$):** For a spontaneous decay, the atom loses energy, so the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step ($n_{\\text{final}} < n_{\\text{initial}}$).\n\n    **Careful Point 1:** A direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. This is a crucial starting point. For such a transition, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms that a two-step process is necessary.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    The decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's identify the quantum numbers $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ for the intermediate state by applying the selection rules to both steps.\n\n    *   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n', l', m'\\rangle$):**\n        *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n        *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n    *   **For the second step ($|n', l', m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        *   The final state has $l=0$. This is consistent with a transition from a state with $l'=1$, since $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$.\n        *   Energy must decrease again, so the intermediate state's principal quantum number $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n    **Careful Point 2:** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value for the intermediate state is $n'=2$. Therefore, the intermediate state must be one of the three 2p sublevels: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle,$ or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means all the transition routes shown in the options are physically plausible paths.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route**\n    The deciding factor is the probability associated with a single, specific decay route. This is the product of the probabilities of each step in the cascade.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n        **Careful Point 3 (The Key Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` ($l=0$) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, and because spontaneous emission is an isotropic process (in the absence of external fields), the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability for any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        **Careful Point 4:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ intermediate states, its only possible decay path to a lower energy state that is allowed by the E1 selection rules is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. As this is the only available decay channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n        $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    Based on the analysis, the correct answer must pair a valid physical transition route with the correctly calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.
