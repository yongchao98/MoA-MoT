Rounding to three significant figures gives **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**. This value corresponds to option D in the question.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is crucial to use the molar mass for the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem, not the anhydrous form.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation is a two-step process. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Then, Ka₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the final [PO₄³⁻] concentration. Using the wrong Ka at any step would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Two-Step Equilibrium:** The problem cannot be solved in a single step. The hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] is established by the primary buffer components and must be calculated first. This value then acts as a known condition for the second equilibrium that produces the orthophosphate ion.\n*   **Approximations:** The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations is valid due to the common ion effect. Similarly, assuming the [HPO₄²⁻] concentration is constant when calculating [PO₄³⁻] is valid because Ka₃ is extremely small.\n*   **Answer Mapping:** The candidate answers show that while the calculation is straightforward, there can be confusion in matching the final numerical result to the correct lettered option, likely due to randomized option lists. The calculation consistently yields ~6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which matches option D in the provided question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the final answer, a thorough, step-by-step analysis of the chemistry problem is necessary.

Rounding to three significant figures (based on the \"1.00 g\" measurements) gives **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**. Comparing this result to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   B) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   C) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   D) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The calculated value matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is essential to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified, not the anhydrous form. All candidate answers correctly identified this.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation is a two-step process that requires two different constants. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer, and Ka₃ must then be used to find the final [PO₄³⁻]. Using the wrong Ka at either step is a common mistake.\n*   **Two-Step Equilibrium:** The concentration of [H⁺] must be determined from the main buffer components first. This [H⁺] is then used as a fixed value to solve the second equilibrium for the minor species, [PO₄³⁻].\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** The provided answers almost universally performed the calculation correctly. The discrepancy in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) stems from the fact that the options were likely presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The numerical result of ~6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M is the consistent, correct outcome of the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a multi-step chemistry problem involving a buffer solution and sequential equilibria. My plan is to first verify the calculation method used by the agents, which appears to be correct, and then execute it to find the numerical answer. Finally, I will compare this result to the options provided in the question to determine the correct choice.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles and Concentrations:** First, I will calculate the number of moles for each of the two salts (KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) using their given masses and molar masses. Then, I'll calculate their molar concentrations by dividing the moles by the solution volume in liters.\n2.  **Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:** The two salts create a buffer of H₂PO₄⁻ (weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (conjugate base). The [H⁺] of this buffer is determined by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₂. I will use the formula: `[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])`.\n3.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** The target ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻. This equilibrium is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃. I will use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the formula: `[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])`.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** The final calculated value for [PO₄³⁻] will be compared against the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n**Careful Points from Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), not an anhydrous form. All agents correctly did this.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The problem requires using two different equilibrium constants in sequence. Ka₂ must be used for the main buffer calculation to find [H⁺], and Ka₃ must be used for the final step to find [PO₄³⁻].\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** The candidate answers are remarkably consistent in their calculation methodology and numerical result, all arriving at approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The primary source of error among the agents was matching their correct numerical result to the lettered options, which were likely presented to them in a shuffled order.

In water, these salts dissociate to form a buffer solution composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate) and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate). The goal is to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻), which is a minor species in this solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Buffer Components:**\n    *   The molar mass of KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol.\n        Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   The molar mass of the hydrated salt Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol.\n        Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L.\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻: [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻: [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The hydrogen ion concentration is established by the primary buffer equilibrium between the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Equilibrium constant expression: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺], assuming the initial concentrations are a good approximation for the equilibrium concentrations in a buffer.\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed in the third dissociation step, where HPO₄²⁻ acts as an acid. This equilibrium is governed by Ka₃.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Equilibrium constant expression: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    We rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻], using the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step.\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M. Rounding to three significant figures gives **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**. Comparing this result to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   B) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   C) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   D) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The calculated value matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is crucial to use the molar mass for the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem, and not the anhydrous form.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation is a two-step process that requires two different equilibrium constants. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Then, Ka₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the final [PO₄³⁻] concentration.\n*   **Two-Step Process:** The concentration of [H⁺] must be determined first from the main buffer components before it can be used to calculate the concentration of the much less abundant orthophosphate ion.\n*   **Approximations:** The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations is valid because they are in a buffer solution and their dissociation/hydrolysis is suppressed by the common ion effect. Similarly, the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ to PO₄³⁻ is negligible in its effect on the overall [HPO₄²⁻] because Ka₃ is extremely small.\n*   **Matching the Answer:** As seen in the candidate answers, a correct calculation can still lead to a wrong final choice if not carefully matched to the original options. The calculated value of 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M corresponds specifically to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and an independent calculation, the correct answer can be determined.

I will use the formula: `[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])`.\n3.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** The target ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻. This equilibrium is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃. I will use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the formula: `[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])`.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** The final calculated value for [PO₄³⁻] will be compared against the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n**Careful Points from Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), not an anhydrous form.

Then, Ka₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the final [PO₄³⁻] concentration.\n*   **Two-Step Process:** The concentration of [H⁺] must be determined first from the main buffer components before it can be used to calculate the concentration of the much less abundant orthophosphate ion.\n*   **Approximations:** The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations is valid because they are in a buffer solution and their dissociation/hydrolysis is suppressed by the common ion effect. Similarly, the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ to PO₄³⁻ is negligible in its effect on the overall [HPO₄²⁻] because Ka₃ is extremely small.\n*   **Matching the Answer:** As seen in the candidate answers, a correct calculation can still lead to a wrong final choice if not carefully matched to the original options. The calculated value of 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M corresponds specifically to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and an independent calculation, the correct answer can be determined.
