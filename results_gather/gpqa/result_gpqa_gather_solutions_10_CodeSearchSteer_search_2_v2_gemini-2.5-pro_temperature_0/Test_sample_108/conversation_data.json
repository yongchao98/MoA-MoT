We need to identify which of the given final states is not permitted based on conservation laws and Pauli statistics.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon system in a `1S0` state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is `S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is `0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial NN state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`. (Nucleons have intrinsic parity +1).\n\nThe generalized Pauli principle for a two-nucleon system states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, which implies `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, or that `L+S+T` must be an odd integer. For the initial state:\n*   `L_i + S_i + T_i = 0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This requires the isospin of the initial state to be `T_i = 1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system `(NN)_f` and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   The final NN state has quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and isospin `T_f`.\n*   The particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X`. The lowercase letters `s, p, d, f` correspond to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`, respectively.\n\nWe must apply the following rules:\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the final NN state:** The problem explicitly states this condition: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. Given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which simplifies to `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved, `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   `P_f = P((NN)_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   So, `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`, which means `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`. This requires `L_f + l_X` to be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum must be conserved, `J_i = J_f_total`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The total final angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle X's angular momentum. Assuming particle X is spinless (like a pion, s_X=0), its total angular momentum is just `l_X`.\n    *   So, `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum). With `J_i = 0`, this implies the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's check each proposed transition against these three conditions:\n1.  `S_f + L_f` is odd.\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd.\n3.  `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p-wave`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n    This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s-wave`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATION.**\n2.  `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n    This transition is not permitted because the final NN state `(3P0, T=0)` violates the Pauli principle.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f-wave`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n    This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p-wave`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n    This transition satisfies all the conservation laws and the Pauli condition as stated. However, a system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is also forbidden.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found two forbidden transitions:\n*   **B** is forbidden because the final NN state violates the Pauli principle as explicitly stated in the problem.\n*   **D** is forbidden because the final NN state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system (S cannot be 3).\n\nWhen a question has multiple technically correct answers, we must infer the intended focus. The question explicitly provides the Pauli statistics condition to be used. Option B is the only one that violates this specific rule. Option D violates a more fundamental, but unstated, principle. Therefore, the question is most likely designed to test the application of the rules it lays out. Based on this reasoning, B is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the laws of conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the given Pauli statistics requirement for the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### Summary of Initial State and Conservation Rules\n\n*   **Initial NN State (`1S0`):**\n    *   Total Spin: `S(NN_i) = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum: `L(NN_i) = 0`\n    *   Total Angular Momentum: `J(NN_i) = 0`\n    *   Parity: `P(NN_i) = (-1)^L(NN_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`\n\n*   **Emitted Particle (X):**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity: `P(X) = -1`\n\n*   **Conservation Laws & Conditions:**\n    1.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total initial angular momentum (`J(NN_i) = 0`) must equal the total final angular momentum. The final angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J(NN_f)`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`L(X)`). For the total to be zero, we must have `J(NN_f) = L(X)`.\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the total final parity (`P_f`).\n        *   `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`\n        *   `P_f = (-1)^L(NN_f) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`\n        *   Therefore, `+1 = (-1) * (-1)^(L(NN_f) + L(X))`, which simplifies to the condition that the sum `L(NN_f) + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics for Final NN State:** The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   With `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   This implies that the sum `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f)` must be **odd**.\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Options\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **Ang.

Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State**: The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we get:\n        *   Total Spin `S_initial = 0` (since `2S+1=1`).\n        *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_initial = 0` (from the letter `S`).\n        *   Total Angular Momentum `J_initial = 0` (from the subscript `0`).\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Decay Process**: The decay is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system is `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws and Constraints**:\n    *   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**: `J_initial = J_final`. Since `J_initial = 0`, the final total angular momentum must also be 0. `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_NN_final`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the sum to be zero, we must have `J_NN_final = l_X`.\n    *   **Conservation of Parity (P)**: `P_initial = P_final`. The final parity is `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`. Since `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_NN_final` and `P(X) = -1`, we have `P_final = (-1)^L_NN_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`. For parity to be conserved (`+1 = P_final`), the exponent `L_NN_final + 1 + l_X` must be even. This means `L_NN_final + l_X` must be **odd**.\n    *   **Pauli Statistics for Final State**: The problem states that for the final NN state with `T(NN) = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_NN_final + L_NN_final + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that `S_NN_final + L_NN_final` must be **odd**.\n\n4.  **Check Each Option**: We will now write a Python script to apply these three rules to each of the given options. The script will also check for the physical validity of the proposed NN states (for two nucleons, total spin S can only be 0 or 1).\n\n```python\ndef solve_nuclear_decay_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four possible nuclear decay channels based on conservation laws\n    and Pauli statistics to find the one that is not permitted.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Mapping from spectroscopic notation to quantum numbers\n    L_map = {'S': 0, 'P': 1, 'D': 2, 'F': 3}\n    l_map = {'s': 0, 'p': 1, 'd': 2, 'f': 3}\n\n    # The decay options to be checked\n    options = {\n        'A': ('7D1', 'p'),\n        'B': ('3P0', 's'),\n        'C': ('3S1', 'p'),\n        'D': ('3D3', 'f'),\n    }\n\n    forbidden_choice = None\n\n    for choice, (nn_state, x_state) in options.items():\n        # --- Parse quantum numbers from the notation ---\n        multiplicity = int(nn_state[0])\n        L_char = nn_state[1]\n        J_NN = int(nn_state[2])\n\n        # S_NN is the total spin of the final two-nucleon system\n        S_NN = (multiplicity - 1) / 2\n        # L_NN is the orbital angular momentum of the final two-nucleon system\n        L_NN = L_map[L_char]\n        # l_X is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X\n        l_X = l_map[x_state]\n\n        # --- Apply the rules ---\n        # Rule 0: The final NN state must be physically possible (S=0 or S=1 for two nucleons)\n        is_physical = S_NN == 0 or S_NN == 1\n        \n        # Rule 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum (J_NN = l_X)\n        conserves_J = (J_NN == l_X)\n\n        # Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (L_NN + l_X must be odd)\n        conserves_P = ((L_NN + l_X) % 2 == 1)\n\n        # Rule 3: Pauli statistics for final NN state with T=0 (S_NN + L_NN must be odd)\n        obeys_pauli = ((S_NN + L_NN) % 2 == 1)\n\n        # A transition is permitted only if all rules are satisfied\n        is_permitted = is_physical and conserves_J and conserves_P and obeys_pauli\n\n        if not is_permitted:\n            forbidden_choice = choice\n            # In this problem, we expect only one forbidden choice among the plausible options.\n            # Option A involves an unphysical state (S=3), which is a fundamental issue.\n            # Option B involves a physical state but violates the Pauli rule for the reaction.\n            # In physics problems of this type, one typically assumes the states are typos if unphysical\n            # and focuses on the reaction dynamics.

Understand the Initial State and Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies initial total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` implies initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` implies initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Decay Process:** `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the final NN system is denoted by `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, ...).\n\n*   **Final State:** The final two-nucleon system `NN(final)` has quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and isospin `T_f`.\n\n*   **Conservation Laws and Constraints:**\n    1.  **Pauli Statistics (given):** For the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. The problem specifies that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n        *   Plugging this in: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n        *   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. This is our first selection rule.\n\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n        *   `P(initial) = P(final)`\n        *   `P(NN_initial) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital)`\n        *   `(-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^{L_f} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X}`\n        *   `(-1)^0 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`\n        *   `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`\n        *   This implies `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n        *   Therefore, `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number. This is our second selection rule.\n\n    3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state (vector sum).\n        *   `J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum), where `j_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X.\n        *   Since `J_i = 0`, we must have `J_f` and `j_X` coupled to zero, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n        *   The total angular momentum of particle X, `j_X`, is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its spin `s_X`. This means `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n        *   So, the condition is `|l_X - s_X| <= J_f <= l_X + s_X`.\n        *   A very common case (and a simplifying assumption if `s_X` is unknown or zero) is that `J_f = l_X`. Let's test this simpler rule first, as it's often sufficient. If a transition is forbidden under this simple rule, it's a strong candidate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Option**\n\nWe will check each proposed transition against our three rules:\n1.  `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  `J_f = l_X` (as a first check for angular momentum conservation).\n\n---\n**A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`. This is **even**. The rule requires it to be odd.\n    *   **This transition violates the Pauli principle.**\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the transition violates a fundamental principle, it is **not permitted**. We do not need to check further, but for completeness:\n    *   Rule 2 (Parity): `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n    *   Rule 3 (Ang.

Final Answer**\n\nThe only transition that violates the selection rules derived from the problem statement is option A. It fails the Pauli statistics requirement for the final state.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each proposed reaction against the fundamental conservation laws of physics and the given Pauli statistics constraint.\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can deduce its quantum numbers:\n*   **Total Spin (S_i):** `2S_i + 1 = 1`  =>  `S_i = 0`\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L_i):** The letter `S` corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J_i):** The number `0` gives `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P_i):** The parity of the NN system is `P_i(NN) = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Conservation Laws and Constraints\nFor the reaction `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X` to be permitted, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_i`) must equal the vector sum of the angular momenta of the final products. Assuming particle X has zero spin, this is `J_i = J_f(NN) + l_X` (vector sum), where `J_f(NN)` is the total angular momentum of the final NN state and `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X.\n    Since `J_i = 0`, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f(NN) = l_X`.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be conserved. The parity of the final state is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of X.\n    The conservation law is `P_i = P_f`, so `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    This simplifies to `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`, which requires that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Constraint 3: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This implies that `S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f(NN) + L_f(NN)` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's test each option against these three constraints. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Constraint 1: `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Constraint 2: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). (Pass)\n*   Constraint 3: `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). (Pass)\n*   **Result: Permitted**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Constraint 1: `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Constraint 2: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (Pass)\n*   Constraint 3: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Pass)\n*   **Result: Permitted**\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Constraint 1: `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `3 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   Constraint 2: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (Pass)\n*   Constraint 3: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (Pass)\n*   **Result: Permitted**\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   Constraint 1: `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `0 = 0`. (Pass)\n*   Constraint 2: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Pass)\n*   Constraint 3: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). (**Fail**)\n*   **Result: Not Permitted**\n\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle constraint for the final two-nucleon state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   **Parity of the initial state**: The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin of the initial state**: The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule that `L + S + T` must be an odd number. For the initial state, `L=0` and `S=0`, so `0 + 0 + T` must be odd, which means the isospin `T(NN_initial) = 1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe transition must obey several rules:\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final state consists of the NN pair and the emitted particle X. Assuming particle X has no intrinsic spin, the total angular momentum of the final system is the vector sum of the NN pair's total angular momentum (`J(NN_final)`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l(X)`).\n    *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   For `J(final)` to be 0, we must be able to couple `J(NN_final)` and `l(X)` to get 0. This is only possible if `J(NN_final) = l(X)`.\n*   **Conservation of Parity**: The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n    *   `P(initial) = +1`.\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l(X)`.\n    *   We are given that the intrinsic parity of X is `P(X) = -1`. The parity of the final NN state is `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)`.\n    *   So, `P(final) = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X) = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l(X))`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l(X))`, which simplifies to `(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l(X)) = -1`.\n    *   This means the sum `L(NN_final) + l(X)` must be **odd**.\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**: The problem states the condition `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T=0`, we get `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be **odd**. (Because an odd number plus 1 is even, which is 0 mod 2).\n    *   This condition is equivalent to the standard Pauli principle that `L+S+T` must be odd for a two-nucleon system. With `T=0`, `L+S` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each proposed transition against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l=1`.\n1.  **Angular Momentum:** Is `J(NN_final) = l(X)`? `1 = 1`. (Yes)\n2.  **Parity:** Is `L(NN_final) + l(X)` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (Yes)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Yes)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l=0`.\n1.  **Angular Momentum:** Is `J(NN_final) = l(X)`? `0 = 0`. (Yes)\n2.  **Parity:** Is `L(NN_final) + l(X)` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Yes)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (No, it's even)\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final two-nucleon state. The state `3P0` with `T=0` is forbidden for nucleons.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l=3`.\n1.  **Angular Momentum:** Is `J(NN_final) = l(X)`? `3 = 3`. (Yes)\n2.  **Parity:** Is `L(NN_final) + l(X)` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (Yes)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (Yes)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` implies `S=3`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (each with spin 1/2) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A total spin of `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Therefore, this transition is not permitted because the final state itself is not a valid two-nucleon state.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options B and D represent transitions that are not permitted. However, option D is forbidden because the proposed final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Option B is forbidden because it violates a specific selection rule (the Pauli principle for the final `T=0` state), even though the state `3P0` is a valid angular momentum state in principle. In physics problems of this nature, one typically evaluates the given options against the provided conservation laws and constraints. Option B is the only one that fails these explicit checks while being composed of otherwise valid quantum numbers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against three fundamental conservation laws and principles:\n\n1.  **Generalized Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** For a two-nucleon system, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the requirement that the sum of the orbital angular momentum (L), total spin (S), and total isospin (T) must be an odd integer: `L + S + T = odd`. The problem provides this rule in a different form for the final state where `T(NN) = 0`: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`, which means `S(NN) + L(NN)` must be odd.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   Initial State (`1S0`): The total angular momentum `J(initial)` is 0.\n    *   Final State (`NN + X`): The final total angular momentum `J(final)` is the vector sum of the final nucleon-nucleon state's angular momentum, `J(NN)`, and the angular momentum of particle X, `l(X)`.\n    *   For the transition to be allowed, `J(NN)` and `l(X)` must be able to couple to 0. This is only possible if `J(NN) = l(X)`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   Initial State (`1S0`): The parity is `P(initial) = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   Final State (`NN + X`): The parity is the product of the final NN state's parity `P(NN) = (-1)^L(NN)`, the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P(X) = -1`, given), and the parity of the relative orbital motion `P(orbital) = (-1)^l(X)`.\n    *   Therefore, `P(final) = (-1)^L(NN) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`.\n    *   The conservation law `P(initial) = P(final)` becomes `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN) + l(X))`. This simplifies to the condition that `L(NN) + l(X)` must be an odd number.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on these three conditions:\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   **Final NN State (`3P0`):** `S(NN) = 1`, `L(NN) = 1`, `J(NN) = 0`.\n*   **Particle X (`s` state):** `l(X) = 0`.\n*   **Pauli Principle Check:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). This violates the condition that `S(NN) + L(NN)` must be odd for a `T(NN) = 0` state.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is forbidden because the final `3P0` state with `T=0` is not allowed by the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n---\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   **Final NN State (`7D1`):** `S(NN) = 3`, `L(NN) = 2`, `J(NN) = 1`.\n*   **Particle X (`p` state):** `l(X) = 1`.\n*   **Pauli Principle Check:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). This is allowed.\n*   **Angular Momentum Check:** `J(NN) = 1` and `l(X) = 1`. Since `J(NN) = l(X)`, they can couple to 0. This is allowed.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L(NN) + l(X) = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd).

This is allowed.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\nOnly option A violates one of the fundamental principles governing the transition.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine which of the given partial waves is not permitted, we must check each option against the fundamental conservation laws of physics: conservation of angular momentum and conservation of parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle as it applies to the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### Summary of a Permitted Transition's Conditions:\n1.  **Initial State (¹S₀):**\n    *   Total Spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Parity `P(NN_initial) = (-1)^L = (-1)⁰ = +1`\n\n2.  **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity `P(X) = -1`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(X)` is denoted by s (0), p (1), d (2), f (3).\n\n3.  **Final State (NN_final + X):**\n    *   The final two-nucleon state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n\n4.  **Conservation and Exclusion Rules:**\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The prompt specifies that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T(NN_final) = 0`, this simplifies to `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`, which means that the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an **odd** number.\n    *   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_initial = 0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J(NN_final)`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`L(X)`). For the sum to be zero, it is required that `J(NN_final) = L(X)`.\n    *   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state (`P_initial = +1`) must equal the total parity of the final state. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P(X) = -1`), and the parity from the orbital motion of X (`(-1)^L(X)`). This gives the equation: `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`.

While it satisfies the conservation of angular momentum and parity, it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state. For the `³P₀` state, `S=1` and `L=1`, so the sum `S+L = 2`, which is an even number. However, the Pauli principle for a `T=0` final state requires this sum to be odd.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is `S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is `0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, meaning `L+S+T` must be an odd integer.\n    *   For the initial state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This implies the initial isospin `T_i` must be odd. The simplest case is `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and the Emitted Particle\nThe reaction is `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n*   The final two-nucleon state `NN_f` has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n*   The emitted particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum `l_X` of the particle `X` relative to the final `NN_f` system.\n    *   `s` => `l_X = 0`\n    *   `p` => `l_X = 1`\n    *   `f` => `l_X = 3`\n*   We assume the particle X is a meson (like a pion), which has spin `s_X = 0`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws and Fundamental Principles\n\nWe need to check each proposed reaction against the following rules:\n\n**Rule 1: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that Pauli statistics require `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nWe are given that the final state has `T_f = 0`.\nSubstituting this into the rule:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number. This, in turn, means that the sum of the final spin and orbital angular momentum, `S_f + L_f`, must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved.\n`J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum).\nSince we assume `s_X=0`, the total angular momentum of particle X is `j_X = l_X`.\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\nSo, `0 = J_f + l_X` (vector sum). This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal, i.e., `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 3: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity must be conserved.\n`P_i = P_f`\nThe initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\nThe final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the final particles and the parity of their relative orbital motion: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n*   Parity of relative motion is `(-1)^l_X`\nSo, the equation for parity conservation is:\n`+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n`+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\nThis simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 4: Validity of the NN State**\nA two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a different total spin is not a valid two-nucleon state.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's create a table to check each option against these four rules.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`) | `l_X` | Rule 1: `S_f+L_f` odd? | Rule 2: `J_f=l_X`? | Rule 3: `L_f+l_X` odd? | Rule 4: `S_f`=0 or 1? | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **A)** | `3P0` (`S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0`) | 0 | `1+1=2` (even) -> **No** | `0=0` -> Yes | `1+0=1` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=1` -> Yes | **No** |\n| **B)** | `3S1` (`S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1`) | 1 | `1+0=1` (odd) -> Yes | `1=1` -> Yes | `0+1=1` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=1` -> Yes | Yes |\n| **C)** | `7D1` (`S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1`) | 1 | `3+2=5` (odd) -> Yes | `1=1` -> Yes | `2+1=3` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=3` -> **No** | **No** |\n| **D)** | `3D3` (`S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3`) | 3 | `1+2=3` (odd) -> Yes | `3=3` -> Yes | `2+3=5` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=1` -> Yes | Yes |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis, we find two forbidden transitions:\n*   **A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`:** This transition is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state (Rule 1). The sum `S_f + L_f = 2` is even, but for a `T_f=0` state, it must be odd.\n*   **C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`:** This transition is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is not a valid state for a two-nucleon system (Rule 4). A `7D1` state would require a total spin `S_f=3`, which is impossible for two spin-1/2 particles.\n\nSince the question asks for a single answer and explicitly provides the Pauli statistics condition (`T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`), it is most likely that the intended answer is the one that violates this specific rule. Option A is the only one that violates this rule. The state in option C is invalid for a more fundamental reason related to the system's composition, but it coincidentally satisfies the given Pauli rule and the conservation laws. Therefore, the violation highlighted by the problem statement points to A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `L` is `S` => Orbital angular momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `J` is `0` => Total angular momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial NN state is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P(NN_initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The generalized Pauli principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule that `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where `T` is the total isospin.\n    *   For the initial state: `L=0, S=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T` must be odd, which implies `T(NN_initial) = 1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n\n*   The final state consists of a new NN state and an emitted particle X.\n*   The particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN system is `l_X`.\n*   The final NN state has quantum numbers `S(NN_final)`, `L(NN_final)`, `J(NN_final)`, and isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n\nWe must check three conditions for the transition to be permitted:\n\n*   **Condition 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    *   The problem states that the final NN state must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This is equivalent to `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN)` being an odd number.\n    *   Since we are given `T(NN_final) = 0`, this simplifies to the condition that `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be odd.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    *   The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = P(NN_initial) = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital = (-1)^{L(NN_final)} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^{L(NN_final) + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   This requires the exponent to be even, which means `L(NN_final) + l_X` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Condition 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    *   The total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final`.\n    *   `J_initial = J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum `J(NN_final)` and the particle X's total angular momentum `j_X`. `j_X` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its spin `s_X`.\n    *   To conserve `J=0`, we must be able to couple `J(NN_final)` and `j_X` to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J(NN_final) = j_X`.\n    *   The relation between `j_X`, `l_X`, and `s_X` is `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n    *   The simplest assumption, common in such problems when `s_X` is not specified, is that X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion), so `s_X = 0`. In this case, `j_X = l_X`, and the conservation law simplifies to `J(NN_final) = l_X`. We will use this simplified rule.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's create a table to check each option against the three conditions.\n\n| Option | Final NN State | S | L | J | l_X | **1. S+L odd?** | **2. L+l_X odd?** | **3. J=l_X?** |\n| :--- | :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1+0=1 (Yes) | 0+1=1 (Yes) | 1=1 (Yes) |\n| B | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 1+2=3 (Yes) | 2+3=5 (Yes) | 3=3 (Yes) |\n| C | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 3+2=5 (Yes) | 2+1=3 (Yes) | 1=1 (Yes) |\n| D | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1+1=2 (**No**) | 1+0=1 (Yes) | 0=0 (Yes) |\n\n**Analysis of Results:**\n\n*   **A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**: All three conditions are satisfied. This transition is permitted.\n*   **B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**: All three conditions are satisfied. This transition is permitted.\n*   **C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**: All three conditions derived from the problem statement are satisfied. While a `S=3` state (`2S+1=7`) is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system (as each nucleon has spin 1/2, their total spin can only be 0 or 1), the transition *itself* does not violate the explicit rules of conservation and Pauli statistics we were asked to check.\n*   **D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**: This transition violates Condition 1 (Pauli statistics for the final state). The sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is even. For a `T=0` state, this sum must be odd.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe partial wave `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because the final two-nucleon state (`3P0` with `T=0`) violates the generalized Pauli principle.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\nFirst, we need to determine the properties of the initial two-nucleon (NN) state, `1S0`, and establish the rules that govern the transition.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`):** The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial state.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   It has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by `l_X` (`s=0`, `p=1`, `f=3`).\n\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   It has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nNow, we establish the three selection rules that any permitted transition `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X` must obey:\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem provides the condition `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since the final state has `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This equation is only true if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number, which means **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   `P_i = P_{NN(final)} * P_X * P_{orbital}`\n    *   The parity of the final NN state is `P_{NN(final)} = (-1)^{L_f}`. The parity of the emitted particle is `P_X = -1`. The parity of the relative orbital motion between the products is `P_{orbital} = (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   Substituting the known values: `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. For this to be true, the exponent must be even, which means **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n    *   `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   Since the initial state has `J_i = 0`, the final angular momenta `J_f` (of the NN system) and `l_X` (of particle X) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   Therefore, the condition on the magnitudes is **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\nA transition is forbidden if it violates any of these three rules.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each proposed transition against the three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. No, it is even. **This rule is violated.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Yes.\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. Yes.\nSince the transition violates the Pauli principle for the final state, it is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Yes.\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. Yes.\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. Yes.\nThis transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` implies `S_f=3`. A system of two spin-1/2 nucleons can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. Yes.\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. Yes.\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. Yes.\nThis transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and C are not permitted. However, they are forbidden for different reasons. Option C is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. Option A is forbidden because it violates one of the explicit selection rules (the Pauli statistics condition) that the problem asks you to apply to the reaction dynamics. In the context of the question, which requires using the given conservation laws and principles, option A is the intended answer as it fails a direct check of those rules.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we must check each proposed transition against three conservation laws or rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The quantum numbers of the final two-nucleon state must satisfy the given relation `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n\nLet's break down the rules based on the initial state and the reaction.\n\n**Initial State: `1S0`**\n*   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from 'S')\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`\n*   The parity of the initial NN state is `P_i(NN) = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**The Reaction: `NN_i -> NN_f + X`**\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system is `l_X`.\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n\nNow let's formulate the rules for a transition to be \"permitted\":\n\n**Rule 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`). Assuming particle X is spin-0 (like a pion), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `j_X = l_X`.\nFor the vector sum `J_f + l_X` to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n`J_f = l_X`\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`, the intrinsic parity of X `P(X) = -1`, and the orbital parity of X `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`.\n`P_i = P_f(NN) * P(X) * P_orbital(X)`\n`+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n`+1 = (-1) * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\nThis equation holds only if `L_f + l_X` is an odd number.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Statistics**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T_f(NN) = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. Since we are given `T_f(NN) = 0`, the rule becomes:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis requires `S_f + L_f` to be an odd number.\n\nLet's check each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (`J_f = l_X`): `3 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   Rule 2 (`L_f + l_X` is odd): `2 + 3 = 5`. **(OK)**\n*   Rule 3 (`S_f + L_f` is odd): `1 + 2 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   This state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system, as the total spin can only be S=0 or S=1.

This is required by the generalized Pauli principle for two nucleons, which states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, leading to the condition `L+S+T` being an odd number. For the initial state, `0+0+T` must be odd, so `T=1`.\n\n2.  **Final State**:\n    *   The final two-nucleon state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0` (given).\n    *   The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s, p, f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X, `l(X)`.\n\n3.  **Conservation Laws and Principles**:\n    *   **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state. Since `J(NN_initial) = 0`, the total angular momentum of the final products must couple to zero. Assuming the emitted particle X has no intrinsic spin (which is standard for this notation), this requires the total angular momentum of the final NN state to be equal in magnitude to the orbital angular momentum of particle X: `J(NN_final) = l(X)`.\n    *   **Conservation of Parity**: The total parity must be conserved. `P(initial) = P(final)`. This means `P(NN_initial) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l(X)`.\n        *   `+1 = ((-1)^L(NN_final)) * (-1) * ((-1)^l(X))`\n        *   This simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l(X))`, which means the sum `L(NN_final) + l(X)` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Pauli Principle for the Final State**: The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given `T(NN_final) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`, which requires the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` to be an odd number. This is consistent with the generalized Pauli principle (`L+S+T` must be odd).\n    *   **Composition of the NN System**: A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles (fermions). Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). A state with `S=3` is not possible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l=1`.\n*   Pauli (`S+L` odd?): `1+0=1` (Odd). **OK.**\n*   J-conservation (`J=l`?): `1=1`. **OK.**\n*   P-conservation (`L+l` odd?): `0+1=1` (Odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l=3`.\n*   Pauli (`S+L` odd?): `1+2=3` (Odd). **OK.**\n*   J-conservation (`J=l`?): `3=3`. **OK.**\n*   P-conservation (`L+l` odd?): `2+3=5` (Odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` implies `S=3`.\n*   A total spin of `S=3` is impossible for a system of two nucleons. Therefore, the final state `7D1` cannot exist.\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is physically impossible.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l=0`.\n*   Pauli (`S+L` odd?): `1+1=2` (Even). **VIOLATED.**\n*   J-conservation (`J=l`?): `0=0`. **OK.**\n*   P-conservation (`L+l` odd?): `1+0=1` (Odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for a `T=0` final state.\n\nBoth C and D are not permitted. However, the violation in C is due to the fundamental composition of a two-nucleon system (it cannot have S=3), making the state `7D1` non-existent. The violation in D is that the proposed final state (`3P0` with `T=0`) violates the generalized Pauli principle (`L+S+T` must be odd; `1+1+0=2` is even). A `3P0` state can only exist if `T=1`. Therefore, the transition is to a state that is forbidden by the Pauli principle under the given condition that `T(NN)=0`. Both are fundamental violations. In the context of applying the given rules, option D directly violates the explicit Pauli condition provided in the prompt (`T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine which of the proposed transitions is not permitted, we must apply the fundamental conservation laws of physics and the Pauli exclusion principle as it applies to nucleons.\n\n### Summary of a Permitted Transition's Conditions:\n\n1.  **Initial State (`1S0` NN system):**\n    *   Total Spin `S(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Parity `P(NN_initial)` = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1.

The final parity is the product of the `NN_final` parity, the intrinsic parity of `X`, and the parity of the relative motion of `X`.\n    *   `P(initial) = P(final)`\n    *   `+1 = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L(NN_final) + l_X` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Condition 2: `L(NN_final) + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n5.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T(NN_final) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that the sum of the final spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN system must be odd.\n    *   **Condition 3: `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be odd.**\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions.

(✓ Condition met)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\nThe only transition that violates the required conditions is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the fundamental conservation laws of physics and the principles of quantum statistics governing nucleons.\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down its properties:\n*   **Term Symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:** `1S0`\n*   **Total Spin `S`:** `2S+1 = 1` → `S(initial) = 0`\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum `L`:** The letter `S` corresponds to `L(initial) = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum `J`:** `J(initial) = 0`.\n*   **Parity `P`:** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin `T`:** The generalized Pauli principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, which implies that `L + S + T` must be an odd number. For the initial state, `0 + 0 + T = odd`, which means `T(initial) = 1`.\n\nThe final state consists of the final NN system and the emitted particle X. The process is `NN(initial) → NN(final) + X`. We must check the following conditions for each proposed transition:\n\n1.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** The problem states that the final NN state has `T(final) = 0` and must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. With `T(final) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S(final) + L(final) + 1 (mod 2)`, which simplifies to requiring that `S(final) + L(final)` must be an **odd** number.\n2.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state is `J(initial) = 0`. The total angular momentum of the final state, `J(final)`, is found by the vector addition of the final NN system's total angular momentum, `J(final NN)`, and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l(X)` (assuming X is a spin-0 particle, which is standard unless specified otherwise). For the transition to be allowed, `J(final)` must be able to equal 0. This is possible only if `J(final NN)` and `l(X)` can be combined to result in 0, which requires `J(final NN) = l(X)`.\n3.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved.\n    *   `P(initial) = +1`.\n    *   `P(final) = P(final NN) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^L(final NN) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`.\n    *   The intrinsic parity of particle X is given as `P(X) = -1`. The term `P(orbital) = (-1)^l(X)` accounts for the parity of the wavefunction of the emitted particle.\n    *   Therefore, `P(final) = -1 * (-1)^(L(final NN) + l(X))`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P(initial) = P(final)`), we need `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(final NN) + l(X))`, which means `L(final NN) + l(X)` must be an **odd** number.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state is `3P0`: `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X is in an `s`-wave: `l(X)=0`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(final) + L(final) = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the requirement that `S+L` be odd for a `T=0` state. Thus, the final state `(T=0) 3P0` is forbidden by the Pauli principle.\n2.  **Angular Momentum:** `J(final NN) = 0`, `l(X) = 0`. `J(final)` can be 0. (Allowed)\n3.  **Parity:** `L(final NN) + l(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Allowed)\nSince the Pauli principle is violated for the final state, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is `3S1`: `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X is in a `p`-wave: `l(X)=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(final) + L(final) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Allowed)\n2.  **Angular Momentum:** `J(final NN) = 1`, `l(X) = 1`. These can be coupled to form a total `J` of 0, 1, or 2. Since `J=0` is possible, this is allowed.\n3.  **Parity:** `L(final NN) + l(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (Allowed)\nThis transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is `7D1`: `2S+1=7` → `S=3`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. An `S=3` state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state is `3D3`: `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X is in an `f`-wave: `l(X)=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(final) + L(final) = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (Allowed)\n2.  **Angular Momentum:** `J(final NN) = 3`, `l(X) = 3`. These can be coupled to form a total `J` from 0 to 6. Since `J=0` is possible, this is allowed.\n3.  **Parity:** `L(final NN) + l(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (Allowed)\nThis transition is **permitted**.\n\nBoth options A and C describe forbidden transitions. However, they are forbidden for different reasons. Option C describes a transition to a state (`S=3`) that is fundamentally impossible for a two-nucleon system. Option A describes a transition to a state (`3P0`) which is physically possible in principle, but is forbidden for the specified isospin `T=0` by the Pauli principle rule explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. Given that the question explicitly provides the Pauli statistics condition to be used, the violation of this rule is the intended mechanism to identify the incorrect transition. Option A is the only one that violates this specific rule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n**1.

The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the final total angular momentum to be zero, it is required that `J_f = l_X`.\n2.  **Parity Conservation**: The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P(X) = -1`), and the parity of X's orbital motion (`(-1)^l_X`). For parity to be conserved, `P_i = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`. This leads to `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`, which simplifies to the condition that the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n**Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n*   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n*   Substituting `T=0` into the rule gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.

However, a system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. A state with S=3 is physically impossible for this system. Therefore, this transition is not permitted because the final state is non-existent.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n*   **Angular Momentum (`J_f = l_X`?):** `3 = 3`. **OK**.\n*   **Parity (`L_f + l_X` odd?):** `2 + 3 = 5`. **OK**.\n*   **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `1 + 2 = 3`. **OK**.\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n*   **Angular Momentum (`J_f = l_X`?):** `0 = 0`. **OK**.\n*   **Parity (`L_f + l_X` odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. **OK**.\n*   **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `1 + 1 = 2`.

However, option D is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle selection rule explicitly provided in the problem statement. Option B is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the proposed final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons. In the context of applying the given rules, option D presents a direct violation of those rules.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will deconstruct the problem to identify the key principles and quantum numbers involved. The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. It decays into a final NN state and a particle X with intrinsic parity -1.\n2.  I will establish the rules that must be satisfied for a transition to be permitted, based on the information given in the prompt:\n    *   **Pauli Statistics for the final NN state:** The prompt provides a specific rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = (S_f + L_f + 1) % 2`, which means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity before and after the decay must be the same. The initial parity is `P_i = P(NN_i) = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`. The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_x`, where `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`, `P(X) = -1` (given), and `l_x` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X. For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x`. This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_x) = -1`, meaning `L_f + l_x` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state `1S0` has total angular momentum `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f(NN)`) and the angular momentum of particle X (`j_x`). For `J_f` to be 0, `J_f(NN)` and `j_x` must be coupled to zero, which requires them to have equal magnitudes. We will assume particle X is spinless, so its total angular momentum `j_x` is just its orbital angular momentum `l_x`. Therefore, the condition is `J_f(NN) = l_x`.\n3.  Next, I will write a Python script to systematically check each of the four options (A, B, C, D) against these three rules.\n4.  For each option, the script will:\n    *   Parse the term symbols (`(2S+1)L(J)`) to extract the final spin `S_f`, final orbital angular momentum `L_f`, and final total angular momentum `J_f` for the NN state.\n    *   Determine the orbital angular momentum `l_x` of particle X from its spectroscopic letter.\n    *   Apply the three checks (Pauli, Parity, Angular Momentum).\n5.  Finally, the script will print a detailed analysis for each option, indicating whether it is permitted or not, and will output the single option that is not permitted according to these rules. The option `D) 7D1` contains a spin `S=3` (`2S+1=7`), which is impossible for a two-nucleon system.

We use the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)` to extract the quantum numbers:\n*   **Spin (S_i):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0` (spin singlet).\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L_i):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J_i):** The subscript `0` gives `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P_i):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Final State and Emitted Particle\n\nThe final state consists of a new two-nucleon state (NN_f) and an emitted particle X.\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN center of mass is `l_X`, denoted by the lowercase letters (`s` for `l_X=0`, `p` for `l_X=1`, `f` for `l_X=3`).\n    *   We assume particle X has zero spin (`S_X=0`), as is typical for such problems (e.g., pion emission).\n*   **Final NN State (NN_f):**\n    *   It has an isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Its quantum numbers (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) are given by the term symbols in each option.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must obey several fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final system.\n    `J_initial = J_final_system`\n    The final system's angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN_f angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`j_X = l_X + S_X`).\n    With `J_i = 0` and assuming `S_X = 0`, the conservation law is `0 = J_f + l_X` (vector sum). This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    The total parity must be conserved.\n    `P_i = P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_relative`\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_relative = (-1)^l_X` (parity from the relative motion of X)\n    Substituting the known values:\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\n    `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`\n    This requires the sum `L_f + l_X` to be an **odd** integer.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle for Final NN State:**\n    The problem provides the specific constraint for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Since we are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`, the condition becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which implies that the sum `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Each Proposed Transition\n\nWe will now check each option against these three conditions. The transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. Yes. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Yes. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. The total spin can only be `S=0` (antiparallel spins) or `S=1` (parallel spins). A spin of `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon state. Therefore, this final state cannot exist, and the transition is not permitted. For completeness, let's check the other rules.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. Yes. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** Not permitted, because the final NN state `7D1` is unphysical.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. **No, 2 is even.** (VIOLATION)\n*   **Conclusion:** Not permitted.\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   C is not permitted because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons.\n*   D is not permitted because it violates the selection rule derived from the Pauli principle (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\nThe question explicitly directs us to use the Pauli statistics requirement. Applying the three main selection rules (J-conservation, P-conservation, and the given Pauli rule), option D is the one that fails. While option C is also impossible, the reason for its failure is the composition of the state itself, whereas the failure in D is a direct violation of one of the transition rules we were asked to check. In the context of such questions, we test the given rules. The rule explicitly given for the final state's quantum numbers is violated by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n    *   For `1S0`: `2S+1=1` -> `S=0` (total spin). `L=S` -> `L=0` (orbital angular momentum). `J=0` (total angular momentum).\n    *   The initial parity is `P_initial = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   The initial total angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Process:** The system emits a particle `X` and transitions to a final NN state.\n    *   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The emission of `X` occurs in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f...).\n\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    1.  **Parity Conservation:** `P_initial = P_final`.\n    2.  **Total Angular Momentum (J) Conservation:** `J_initial = J_final`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Constraints\n\n*   **Final State:** `NN_final + X`.\n    *   The final NN state is described by `(2S'+1)L'(J')`.\n    *   The particle `X` has orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n\n*   **Applying Parity Conservation:**\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital = (-1)^L' * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L' + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   Since `P_initial = +1`, we must have `+1 = (-1)^(L' + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This implies that the exponent `L' + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   Therefore, `L' + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Applying Angular Momentum Conservation:**\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J'` and the total angular momentum of particle X, `j_X`.\n    *   So, `vec{J}_{final} = vec{J'} + vec{j_X}`. For `J_final` to be 0, we must have `vec{J'} = -vec{j_X}`, which means their magnitudes are equal: `J' = j_X`.\n    *   The total angular momentum of X is `vec{j_X} = vec{l_X} + vec{s_X}`, where `s_X` is the spin of X. The triangle inequality states `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n    *   Combining these gives the constraint `|l_X - s_X| <= J' <= l_X + s_X`.\n    *   If we assume X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion, a common scenario for a particle with `P=-1`), then `s_X=0`, and the constraint simplifies to `J' = l_X`.\n\n*   **Applying the Pauli Principle:**\n    *   The problem states a specific rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are also given the condition that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T'=0` into the rule gives `0 = S' + L' + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This requires `S' + L' + 1` to be an even number, which means `S' + L'` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Constraint on NN States:**\n    *   A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). Any other value of `S` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each proposed transition against these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_final`: `3D3` -> `S'=1, L'=2, J'=3`.\n*   `X`: f-wave -> `l_X = 3`.\n*   **NN State Validity:** `S'=1` is allowed. `|L'-S'| <= J' <= L'+S'` -> `|2-1| <= 3 <= 2+1` -> `1 <= 3 <= 3`. Valid.\n*   **Pauli (`S'+L'` odd?):** `1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Parity (`L'+l_X` odd?):** `2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **J-Cons. (`J'=l_X` for `s_X=0`):** `3 = 3`. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN_final`: `7D1` -> `2S'+1=7` -> `S'=3`. `L'=2, J'=1`.\n*   `X`: p-wave -> `l_X = 1`.\n*   **NN State Validity:** `S'=3` is **not possible** for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is not permitted because the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN_final`: `3S1` -> `S'=1, L'=0, J'=1`.\n*   `X`: p-wave -> `l_X = 1`.\n*   **NN State Validity:** `S'=1` is allowed. `|L'-S'| <= J' <= L'+S'` -> `|0-1| <= 1 <= 0+1` -> `1 <= 1 <= 1`. Valid.\n*   **Pauli (`S'+L'` odd?):** `1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Parity (`L'+l_X` odd?):** `0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **J-Cons. (`J'=l_X` for `s_X=0`):** `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN_final`: `3P0` -> `S'=1, L'=1, J'=0`.\n*   `X`: s-wave -> `l_X = 0`.\n*   **NN State Validity:** `S'=1` is allowed. `|L'-S'| <= J' <= L'+S'` -> `|1-1| <= 0 <= 1+1` -> `0 <= 0 <= 2`. Valid.\n*   **Pauli (`S'+L'` odd?):** `1+1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the Pauli principle for a `T'=0` state.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is not permitted.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **B)** is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` (`S=3`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   **D)** is forbidden because for the final NN state `3P0` (`S=1, L=1`), the sum `S'+L'` is even, which violates the given Pauli principle under the condition that `T'=0`.\n\nWhile both are forbidden, the question is structured to test the application of the explicitly provided rules, especially the Pauli statistics rule. The violation in option D is a direct contradiction of this rule under the specified conditions (`T'=0`). The violation in option B relies on implicit knowledge (spin of a nucleon) not explicitly stated in the problem prompt. In such cases, the intended answer is most likely the one that violates the explicitly given constraints. The combination of the `3P0` state with the condition `T=0` is impossible due to the Pauli principle that was provided.\n\nLet's check the other conservation laws for D to confirm the Pauli violation is the sole issue.\n*   Parity: `L'+l_X = 1+0=1` (odd). OK.\n*   J-Conservation: `J'=0, l_X=0`. This requires `s_X=0` for the angular momenta to couple to `J_final=0`. So `J'=l_X` is satisfied. OK.\n\nThe only violation for transition D is the Pauli principle.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine the quantum numbers:\n        *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  implies initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   `L` is 'S', which means initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   `J` is '0', which means initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The initial NN system emits a particle X and transitions to a final NN state.\n    *   `NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n    *   The intrinsic parity of particle X is given as `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `J_i = J_f`\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_{NN_f}`) and the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X (`l_X`).\n    *   For `vec(J_{NN_f}) + vec(l_X)` to equal 0, their magnitudes must be equal: `J_{NN_f} = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = P_f`\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P_{NN_f}`), the intrinsic parity of X (`P_X`), and the parity of the relative orbital motion (`(-1)^{l_X}`).\n    *   `P_f = P_{NN_f} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_{NN_f}} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   Setting `P_i = P_f`: `+1 = (-1)^{L_{NN_f}} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_{NN_f} + l_X} = -1`, which means the sum `L_{NN_f} + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 2. Apply the Pauli Statistics Constraint\n\n*   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting this into the rule: `0 = S_{NN_f} + L_{NN_f} + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This implies that the sum `S_{NN_f} + L_{NN_f}` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition\n\nA transition is permitted only if it satisfies all three of the following conditions:\n1.  `J_{NN_f} = l_X` (from J conservation)\n2.  `L_{NN_f} + l_X` is **odd** (from P conservation)\n3.  `S_{NN_f} + L_{NN_f}` is **odd** (from Pauli statistics for T=0)\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each of the given final states against these three conditions.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `3 = 3`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n*   *Note on the state's existence:* A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, a state with S=3 is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. This means the transition is forbidden because the final state cannot exist. However, we will proceed to check the transition rules as instructed.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓)\n*   Conclusion: This transition satisfies all the given conservation laws and rules, but is forbidden on the more fundamental ground that the final NN state is impossible.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `0 = 0`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (**X**)\n*   Conclusion: This transition violates the Pauli statistics condition for a T=0 final state. Therefore, this partial wave is **not permitted**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nWhile option (C) describes a transition to a physically impossible state, option (D) is the one that violates the specific selection rules derived from the conservation laws and the Pauli constraint provided in the problem statement. In the context of such physics problems, the goal is typically to apply these specific transition rules. The transition in option (D) is dynamically forbidden by these rules.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the conservation laws of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle as specified for the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\n1.  **Initial State (NN)**: `1S0`\n    *   Total Spin `S(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Parity `P(NN_initial)` = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1\n\n2.  **Emitted Particle (X)**:\n    *   Intrinsic Parity `P(X)` = -1\n\n3.  **Final State (NN + X)**:\n    *   Final NN Isospin `T(NN_final)` = 0\n\n### Conservation Laws & Pauli Principle\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    *   `J(NN_initial)` = `J(NN_final)` + `L(X)` (vector sum)\n    *   Since `J(NN_initial)` = 0, this implies `J(NN_final)` must be equal in magnitude to the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `L(X)`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity**: The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    *   `P(initial)` = `P(NN_initial)` = +1\n    *   `P(final)` = `P(NN_final)` * `P(X)` * `P(orbital)` = `(-1)^L(NN_final)` * `(-1)` * `(-1)^L(X)`\n    *   Equating the two: `+1 = -(-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X))`\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X)) = -1`, which means the sum `L(NN_final) + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Given `T(NN_final) = 0`, the equation becomes `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This requires the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1` to be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be **odd**.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each transition against these three conditions. The notation for the final state is `(NN state) + (particle X orbital)`. The term symbol for the NN state is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): S=1, L=0, J=1.\n*   Particle X (`p`): L(X)=1.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J(NN_final)` = 1 and `L(X)` = 1. Condition `J(NN_final) = L(X)` is met. **(Allowed)**\n2.  **Parity**: `L(NN_final) + L(X)` = 0 + 1 = 1 (odd). **(Allowed)**\n3.  **Pauli**: `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` = 1 + 0 = 1 (odd). **(Allowed)**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): This term symbol implies `2S+1 = 7`, which means `S=3`. A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. A total spin of S=3 is not possible.\nTherefore, this final state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system, and the transition is not permitted. While one could check the other conservation rules, the impossibility of the final state is the most fundamental reason for it being forbidden.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): S=1, L=2, J=3.\n*   Particle X (`f`): L(X)=3.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J(NN_final)` = 3 and `L(X)` = 3. Condition `J(NN_final) = L(X)` is met. **(Allowed)**\n2.  **Parity**: `L(NN_final) + L(X)` = 2 + 3 = 5 (odd). **(Allowed)**\n3.  **Pauli**: `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` = 1 + 2 = 3 (odd). **(Allowed)**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): S=1, L=1, J=0.\n*   Particle X (`s`): L(X)=0.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J(NN_final)` = 0 and `L(X)` = 0. Condition `J(NN_final) = L(X)` is met. **(Allowed)**\n2.  **Parity**: `L(NN_final) + L(X)` = 1 + 0 = 1 (odd). **(Allowed)**\n3.  **Pauli**: `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` = 1 + 1 = 2 (even). This **violates** the condition that `S+L` must be odd. **(Not Permitted)**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have identified two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **B)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **D)** is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule given in the problem for a final state with T=0.\n\nIn the context of problems involving selection rules, it is common to test the application of those specific rules on states that are otherwise assumed to be plausible. Option D is ruled out directly by one of the stated conditions to be checked (the Pauli rule). The issue with Option B is more fundamental, concerning the composition of the state itself rather than the transition dynamics. It is highly probable that Option D is the intended answer, as it fails a direct application of the provided selection rules.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers:\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S(i) + 1 = 1`  implies the total spin `S(i) = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` implies the orbital angular momentum `L(i) = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` implies the total angular momentum `J(i) = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is `P(i) = (-1)^L(i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   According to the generalized Pauli principle for two nucleons, the sum `L + S + T` must be odd. For the initial state, `0 + 0 + T(i)` must be odd, which means the isospin `T(i) = 1`.\n\n### 2. Final State and Particle X Analysis\n\nThe system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T(f) = 0`.\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The orbital angular momentum of particle X relative to the NN system is denoted by a lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, f=3). This contributes `(-1)^L(X)` to the final state's parity.\n\n### 3. Conservation Laws and Selection Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for the transition to be permitted:\n\n**Rule 1: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n`P(i) = P(f) = P(final NN) * P(X) * P(relative motion)`\n`+1 = (-1)^L(f) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`\n`+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(f) + L(X))`\n`-1 = (-1)^(L(f) + L(X))`\nThis implies that the sum **`L(f) + L(X)` must be odd**.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the vector sum of the angular momenta of the final products. Assuming the emitted particle X has zero spin (a common convention for partial wave analysis unless specified otherwise), the conservation law is:\n`J(i) = J(f) + L(X)` (vector sum)\nSince `J(i) = 0`, the equation becomes `0 = J(f) + L(X)`. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal: **`J(f) = L(X)`**.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Principle for the Final State**\nThe problem explicitly states that for the final NN state, `T(f) = S(f) + L(f) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nGiven that `T(f) = 0`, the condition becomes:\n`0 = S(f) + L(f) + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis requires that **`S(f) + L(f)` must be odd**.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S(f) = 1`, `L(f) = 1`, `J(f) = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `L(X) = 0`.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L(f) + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd).  -> **OK**\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** `J(f) = 0` and `L(X) = 0`. `J(f) = L(X)`. -> **OK**\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S(f) + L(f) = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). -> **FAIL**\n\nThis transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S(f) = 1`, `L(f) = 2`, `J(f) = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `L(X) = 3`.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L(f) + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** `J(f) = 3` and `L(X) = 3`. `J(f) = L(X)`. -> **OK**\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S(f) + L(f) = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S(f) = 1`, `L(f) = 0`, `J(f) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `L(X) = 1`.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L(f) + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** `J(f) = 1` and `L(X) = 1`. `J(f) = L(X)`. -> **OK**\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S(f) + L(f) = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S(f)+1=7` implies `S(f) = 3`. However, a two-nucleon system (composed of two spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Thus, the state `7D1` is not a possible state for a two-nucleon system. While this makes the transition impossible, we can still check it against the given rules for completeness.\n*   `S(f) = 3`, `L(f) = 2`, `J(f) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `L(X) = 1`.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L(f) + L(X) = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** `J(f) = 1` and `L(X) = 1`. `J(f) = L(X)`. -> **OK**\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S(f) + L(f) = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\nThis transition is forbidden because the final state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. However, option A is forbidden by a direct violation of the selection rules explicitly mentioned in the problem description to be used. In physics problems of this type, the answer is the one that violates the given conservation laws or selection rules.\n\nConclusion: Option A is the only one that violates the selection rules provided in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Define the System and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State (NN_i):** A two-nucleon system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1`  => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The initial system emits a particle X: `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Particle X is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` relative to the final NN system. The spectroscopic notation for `l_X` is given by the lowercase letter (`s` for `l_X=0`, `p` for `l_X=1`, `f` for `l_X=3`).\n\n*   **Final State (NN_f + X):**\n    *   The final two-nucleon state `NN_f` has isospin `T_f = 0`. Its other quantum numbers (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) are given by its term symbol.\n    *   The total final state is the combination of `NN_f` and particle `X`.\n\nWe need to check three conditions for each proposed reaction:\n1.  **Conservation of Parity:** `P_i = P_f`.\n2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** `J_i = J_f`.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** For the final `NN` state, the given rule must hold: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Rules for this Specific Problem\n\n1.  **Parity Rule:**\n    *   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`, where `P_orbital` is the parity of the relative motion between `NN_f` and `X`.\n    *   `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   Since `P_i = +1`, we must have `P_f = +1`.\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`. This means the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n2.  **Angular Momentum Rule:**\n    *   The total final angular momentum `J_f_total` is the vector sum of the `NN_f` angular momentum `J_f` and the particle `X`'s orbital angular momentum `l_X` (we assume X is spinless).\n    *   `J_f_total = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   For `J_f_total` to equal `J_i = 0`, the vectors `J_f` and `l_X` must be able to sum to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal.\n    *   Therefore, **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Rule:**\n    *   We are given `T_f = 0`. The rule is `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T_f=0`: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n    *   Therefore, **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n### 3. Test Each Option\n\nNow we apply these three rules to each option. A transition is forbidden if it violates any one of these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN_f` state is `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle `X` state is `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **This violates the rule** that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   **Parity Rule:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). This is okay.\n*   **Angular Momentum Rule:** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. This is okay.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** due to the violation of the Pauli principle.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` state is `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle `X` state is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). Okay.\n*   **Parity Rule:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). Okay.\n*   **Angular Momentum Rule:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. Okay.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   The `NN_f` state is `7D1`. The multiplicity `2S_f+1 = 7` implies `S_f = 3`. A system of two spin-1/2 nucleons can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). `S=3` is impossible. Therefore, the final `NN` state is unphysical, and the transition is not permitted. It is highly likely this is a typo for `3D1`. If we assume it is `3D1`, the transition is permitted (as shown in the thought process). In either interpretation, there is a reason this option could be seen as \"not permitted\", but option A violates the specific rule given in the prompt.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_f` state is `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle `X` state is `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). Okay.\n*   **Parity Rule:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). Okay.\n*   **Angular Momentum Rule:** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. Okay.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe transition in option A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`) is the only one that violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly provided in the question for a final state with `T(NN)=0`. The other transitions (assuming `7D1` is a typo for `3D1`) satisfy all the required conservation laws and statistical rules.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` corresponds to an orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` is the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe problem states that the reaction `NN_initial -> NN_final + X` must satisfy several conditions.\n\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. We will denote its orbital angular momentum by `l_X`. The problem does not specify the spin of X (`s_X`). A common assumption for such problems is that X is a spin-0 meson (like a pion), so its total angular momentum is `J_X = l_X`. We will proceed with this assumption.\n*   **Final NN State:** Has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must check three rules for each potential transition:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f_NN`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`J_X`). For `J_f` to be 0, `J_f_NN` and `J_X` must be coupled to zero. This is only possible if `J_f_NN = J_X`. Assuming `s_X = 0`, this simplifies to `J_f_NN = l_X`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the parity of X's orbital motion.\n    *   `P_f_NN = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`\n    *   So, `P_f = P_f_NN * P(X) * P_orbital(X) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `P_i = P_f`, so `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`. This implies that the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Pauli Principle for Final NN State:** The problem gives the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final state has `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation requires `S_f + L_f` to be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f_NN=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Allowed**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f_NN=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 0` and `l_X = 0`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Not Permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2` (D state). `J_f_NN=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Fundamental Issue:** A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. The total spin can only be `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet state) or `S = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0` (singlet state). It is impossible for two nucleons to form a spin `S=3` state. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. This transition is forbidden on these grounds.\n*   However, if we strictly and mechanically apply *only the rules listed in the prompt*, we get:\n    1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n    2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n    3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   This creates an ambiguity. The state is impossible, but it passes the test of the explicit rules given. In multiple-choice questions, we should look for the most direct violation of the given constraints. The violation in option B is a direct failure to meet the Pauli statistics rule as stated in the prompt. The issue with C is more fundamental but relies on knowledge not explicitly listed in the constraints to be checked. Therefore, B is the most likely intended answer.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f_NN=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 3` and `l_X = 3`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Allowed**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the options, transition B is the only one that violates the explicitly stated Pauli principle for a final state with `T=0`. While transition C describes an unphysical final state, it formally satisfies the rules given in the prompt. The question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave using the given conservation laws and statistics. Option B fails this test directly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial NN (two-nucleon) state:** The system starts in a `1S0` state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial state:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S = 0`.\n    *   The spectroscopic letter `S` implies the total orbital angular momentum is `L = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` implies the total angular momentum is `J = 0`.\n*   **Initial Parity:** The parity of a two-particle system is given by `P = P1 * P2 * (-1)^L`, where `P1` and `P2` are the intrinsic parities of the particles. Nucleons have an intrinsic parity of `+1`.\n    *   `P_initial = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Emitted Particle X:**\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`, etc.), which we'll call `l_X`.\n*   **Final NN state:**\n    *   It is described by the term symbol `(2S'+1)L'(J')`.\n    *   We are given that its isospin is `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Selection Rules to Be Applied\n\nThe problem states we must use three key principles:\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics (as specified):** The problem gives a specific form of the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state: `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN)` must be an odd number. Since we are given `T(NN) = 0`, this simplifies to:\n    *   **Rule 1: `S' + L'` must be odd.**\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the system must be the same before and after the emission.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   `P_final = P(final NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`\n    *   `P(final NN) = (-1)^L'`\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^L' * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L' + l_X + 1)`\n    *   For this to be true, the exponent `L' + l_X + 1` must be even. This implies:\n    *   **Rule 2: `L' + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial = J_final`\n    *   From the initial `1S0` state, we have `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J'`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n    *   The simplest assumption, common in such problems unless specified otherwise, is that the emitted particle X is spinless (`s_X = 0`). In this case, `j_X = l_X`.\n    *   The conservation law becomes `vec(J_initial) = vec(J') + vec(l_X)`.\n    *   `vec(0) = vec(J') + vec(l_X)`. This can only be true if the vectors have equal magnitude and opposite direction. Thus:\n    *   **Rule 3: `J' = l_X`** (assuming `s_X = 0`).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Proposed Transition\n\nWe will now test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S'=1`, `L'=1`, `J'=0`.\n*   Particle X state (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S' + L'` odd?):** `1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **This violates Rule 1.**\n2.  Parity Check (`L' + l_X` odd?): `1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  J-Conservation Check (`J' = l_X`?): `0 = 0`. This is satisfied.\nSince the transition violates the Pauli principle, it is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S'=1`, `L'=2`, `J'=3`.\n*   Particle X state (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S' + L'` odd?):** `1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n2.  **Parity Check (`L' + l_X` odd?):** `2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **J-Conservation Check (`J' = l_X`?):** `3 = 3`. This is satisfied.\nThis transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S'=1`, `L'=0`, `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S' + L'` odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n2.  **Parity Check (`L' + l_X` odd?):** `0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **J-Conservation Check (`J' = l_X`?):** `1 = 1`. This is satisfied.\nThis transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S'+1=7` => `S'=3`. `L'=2`, `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S' + L'` odd?):** `3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n2.  **Parity Check (`L' + l_X` odd?):** `2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **J-Conservation Check (`J' = l_X`?):** `1 = 1`. This is satisfied.\nThis transition appears permitted by the three rules. However, there is a fundamental issue: a system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S'=0` or `S'=1`. A state with `S'=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. This violates the principles of angular momentum addition. While this makes the transition forbidden, it's forbidden because the final state cannot exist, not because it violates the transition selection rules given.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, option A is the only one that directly violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem statement (`S' + L'` must be odd). The other transitions satisfy this rule. While option D describes a physically impossible final state, it does not violate the explicit selection rules for the process itself in the same way that option A does. In the context of applying the given rules, A is the unambiguously forbidden transition.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each proposed transition against three constraints:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem states that for a final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the total spin `S_f` and orbital angular momentum `L_f` must satisfy `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The initial state `1S0` has a total angular momentum `J_i = 0`. The final state consists of the final NN system with total angular momentum `J_f` and the particle X with orbital angular momentum `l_X`. To conserve total angular momentum, the vector sum `J_f + l_X` must equal `J_i = 0`. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal, so `J_f = l_X`.\n3.  **Conservation of Parity:**\n    *   The parity of the initial `1S0` state is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   The parity of the final state is the product of the final NN state's parity `P_f(NN) = (-1)^{L_f}` and the parity of the emitted particle X system.\n    *   The parity of the X system is its intrinsic parity (`-1`) multiplied by its orbital parity `(-1)^{l_X}`, which gives `P(X_system) = (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{l_X+1}`.\n    *   Therefore, the total final parity is `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X_system) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X+1} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `(-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1} = +1`. This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\nLet's examine each option based on these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   Rule 1 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 2 (Ang.

This leads to the condition that the sum of orbital angular momentum (L), spin (S), and isospin (T) must be an odd number (`L+S+T = odd`). For the initial `1S0` state (`L=0, S=0`), the isospin must be `T(i) = 1`.\n\n2.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem states the final two-nucleon (NN) state has isospin `T(NN,f) = 0`.\n    *   The Pauli principle for this final state (`L(f) + S(f) + T(f) = odd`) requires that `L(f) + S(f)` must be odd.\n    *   The prompt provides this condition in the form `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`, which for `T(NN)=0` also implies `S(f) + L(f)` must be odd.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   The total angular momentum must be conserved, so `J(i) = J(f)`.\n    *   Since `J(i) = 0`, the total angular momentum of the final products must also be zero.

Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final NN State\n\nThe generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a system of two identical fermions like nucleons requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric upon particle exchange. This leads to a specific condition relating the total orbital angular momentum (L), total spin (S), and total isospin (T) of the two-nucleon (NN) system. The relationship is that the sum `L + S + T` must be an odd integer.\n\nThe problem states that the final NN state has an isospin `T(NN) = 0`. Plugging this into the Pauli principle (`L + S + T = odd`) gives the condition that for the final state, `L(NN) + S(NN)` must be **odd**.\n\nLet's examine the NN state for each option:\n*   **A) 7D1:** The term symbol (2S+1)L(J) tells us L=2 (a D-state) and 2S+1=7, so S=3. The sum `L+S = 2+3 = 5`, which is **odd**. This state is allowed by the Pauli principle for T=0.\n*   **B) 3D3:** Here, L=2 and 2S+1=3, so S=1. The sum `L+S = 2+1 = 3`, which is **odd**. This state is also allowed for T=0.\n*   **C) 3S1:** Here, L=0 (an S-state) and 2S+1=3, so S=1. The sum `L+S = 0+1 = 1`, which is **odd**. This state is allowed for T=0.\n*   **D) 3P0:** Here, L=1 (a P-state) and 2S+1=3, so S=1. The sum `L+S = 1+1 = 2`, which is **even**.\n\nSince `L+S` is even for the `3P0` state, it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system with isospin T=0. Therefore, this state cannot exist, and no reaction can produce it. This alone is sufficient to identify option D as the forbidden transition.\n\nFor completeness, we will also check the other conservation laws.\n\n### 2. Conservation of Parity\n\nParity must be conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions. The parity of a system is given by `P = P_intrinsic * (-1)^L`, where L is the orbital angular momentum.\n*   **Initial State (1S0):** The initial NN state has `L_i = 0`. Its parity is `P_i = (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Final State (NN_f + X):** The final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`.\n    *   The intrinsic parity of particle X is given as `P(X) = -1`.\n*   **Parity Conservation (`P_i = P_f`):**\n    `+1 = ((-1)^L_f) * (-1) * ((-1)^l_X)`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\nLet's check this for all options:\n*   **A) 7D1 + p:** `L_f=2`, `l_X=1`. `L_f + l_X = 2+1 = 3` (odd). **Allowed.**\n*   **B) 3D3 + f:** `L_f=2`, `l_X=3`. `L_f + l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **Allowed.**\n*   **C) 3S1 + p:** `L_f=0`, `l_X=1`. `L_f + l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **Allowed.**\n*   **D) 3P0 + s:** `L_f=1`, `l_X=0`. `L_f + l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **Allowed.**\n\nParity conservation does not forbid option D.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Angular Momentum\n\nTotal angular momentum must be conserved in any decay process.\n*   **Initial State (1S0):** The total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Final State (NN_f + X):** The total final angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the NN state's total angular momentum `J_f(NN)` and the angular momentum of particle X. The angular momentum of X is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `S_X`.\n*   **Conservation (`J_i = J_f`):** `0 = J_f(NN) + l_X + S_X` (vector sum). This means the three angular momentum vectors must be able to form a closed triangle.\n\nAssuming the simplest case where particle X has no spin (`S_X=0`), the condition becomes `J_f(NN) = l_X`.\n*   **A) 7D1 + p:** `J_f(NN)=1`, `l_X=1`. `1=1`. **Allowed.**\n*   **B) 3D3 + f:** `J_f(NN)=3`, `l_X=3`. `3=3`. **Allowed.**\n*   **C) 3S1 + p:** `J_f(NN)=1`, `l_X=1`. `1=1`. **Allowed.**\n*   **D) 3P0 + s:** `J_f(NN)=0`, `l_X=0`. `0=0`. **Allowed.**\n\nUnder the assumption of a spinless particle X, angular momentum conservation does not forbid option D. However, the violation of the Pauli exclusion principle is definitive.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because the final nucleon-nucleon state, `3P0` with `T=0`, is forbidden by the generalized Pauli exclusion principle. The sum of its orbital angular momentum (`L=1`) and spin (`S=1`) is even, whereas for an isospin `T=0` state, this sum must be odd.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the fundamental conservation laws of physics and the specific conditions given in the problem.\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\n1.  **Initial State (`1S0` NN system):**\n    *   Total Spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Parity `P(initial) = (-1)^L(NN_initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`\n\n2.  **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   We assume the spin of particle X is zero, as is common for emitted mesons in such problems. The lowercase letter (s, p, f) denotes its orbital angular momentum, `l(X)`.\n\n3.  **Final State (NN_final + X):**\n    *   The final two-nucleon state has Isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n\n4.  **Selection Rules:**\n    *   **Pauli Principle:** The prompt provides the condition derived from the Pauli principle for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T(NN) = 0`, this simplifies to `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity must be conserved. `P(initial) = P(final)`.\n        `P(NN_initial) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital)`\n        `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`\n        This requires that `L(NN_final) + l(X)` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. `J(initial) = J(final)`.\n        `J(NN_initial) = J(NN_final) + l(X)` (vector sum).\n        Since `J(NN_initial) = 0`, the final angular momenta must sum to zero, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN_final) = l(X)`.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\nWe will test each option against these three selection rules. The transition is not permitted if it fails even one rule.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l(X)=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `3 = 3`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l(X)=0`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). **FAILS.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `0 = 0`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final T=0 state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l(X)=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l(X)=1`.\n*   A state with total spin S=3 is not possible for a two-nucleon system, as each nucleon has spin 1/2, so the total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. Therefore, this final state cannot exist. However, the question asks to evaluate the permission of the partial wave based on the provided conservation laws. Applying the rules mechanically:\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 3+2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 2+1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   While the state itself is impossible, the transition *formally satisfies* all the selection rules given in the prompt. The most direct violation of the rules explicitly provided for the transition dynamics is in option B.\n\nBased on the violation of the Pauli principle as specified in the problem, option B is the partial wave that is not permitted.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial system is a bound two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n- The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n- **Spin `S_i`**: `2S_i + 1 = 1` gives `S_i = 0`.\n- **Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i`**: The 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n- **Total Angular Momentum `J_i`**: The subscript is `0`, so `J_i = 0`.\n- **Parity `P_i`**: The parity of an NN system is given by `(-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n- **Isospin `T_i`**: The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a system of two identical fermions (nucleons) requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric upon exchange of the particles. This leads to the condition `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, meaning `L+S+T` must be an odd number.\n- For the initial `1S0` state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. Thus, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which implies `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `J_i=0`, `P_i=+1`, `T_i=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Emitted Particle\n\nThe system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n`NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n\n- **Particle X**:\n    - Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    - Orbital angular momentum `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f for `l_X`=0, 1, 2, 3 respectively).\n    - Let the unknown spin of X be `s_X`.\n- **Final NN state**:\n    - Term symbol is `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    - Spin `S_f`, orbital angular momentum `L_f`, total angular momentum `J_f`.\n    - Parity `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`.\n    - We are given that the isospin is `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe need to check three main conditions for each proposed transition.\n\n**Constraint 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem explicitly states that the final NN state must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `T_f + S_f + L_f` being an odd integer.\nGiven `T_f = 0`, this constraint simplifies to: **`S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n\n**Constraint 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity must be conserved: `P_i = P_f`.\n`P_i` is the parity of the initial NN state, which is `+1`.\n`P_f` is the parity of the final system (NN_f + X), which is `P_f(NN) * P(X) = P_f(NN) * P_X * (-1)^l_X`.\n- `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`.\n- `P_X = -1`.\nSo, `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\nThis implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means: **`L_f + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n**Constraint 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved: `vec{J}_i = vec{J}_f_total`.\n`J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum `vec{J}_f_total = vec{J}_f + vec{j}_X`, where `vec{j}_X = vec{l}_X + vec{s}_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X.\nConservation requires `vec{J}_f + vec{j}_X = 0`, which means `J_f = j_X`.\nThe triangle inequality for angular momentum coupling (`vec{l}_X + vec{s}_X = vec{j}_X`) gives `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\nSubstituting `J_f = j_X`, we get: **`|l_X - s_X| <= J_f <= l_X + s_X`**. This must be possible for some non-negative spin `s_X`. A simple case often assumed is `s_X = 0` (e.g., for a pion), which simplifies this to `J_f = l_X`.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each option against these three constraints.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\nThe final state `7D1` implies `2S_f+1 = 7`, or `S_f=3`. A two-nucleon system is made of two spin-1/2 particles, so the total spin can only be `S=0` or `S=1`. `S=3` is impossible. This transition is forbidden because the final NN state is not physically possible.\n*Note: This is very likely a typo for `3D1`. If we assume it is `3D1` (`S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=1`) and `l_X=1` (for `p`):\n1. `S_f+L_f = 1+2 = 3` (odd) -> OK.\n2. `L_f+l_X = 2+1 = 3` (odd) -> OK.\n3. `J_f=l_X` (for `s_X=0`) is `1=1` -> OK. So if this is a typo, the transition is allowed.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n- Final NN state: `3P0` -> `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n- Particle X: `s`-wave -> `l_X=0`.\nLet's check the constraints:\n1. **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the Pauli constraint that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for `T_f = 0`.\nThis transition is forbidden.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n- Final NN state: `3S1` -> `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n- Particle X: `p`-wave -> `l_X=1`.\n1. **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). -> OK.\n2. **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). -> OK.\n3. **Ang. Mom.:** If `s_X=0`, `J_f = l_X` -> `1 = 1`. -> OK.\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n- Final NN state: `3D3` -> `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n- Particle X: `f`-wave -> `l_X=3`.\n1. **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). -> OK.\n2. **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). -> OK.\n3. **Ang. Mom.:** If `s_X=0`, `J_f = l_X` -> `3 = 3`. -> OK.\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` (Option B) is forbidden because the final two-nucleon state `3P0` with `T=0` violates the generalized Pauli principle (`S_f + L_f` is even, not odd). This rule was explicitly provided in the problem statement. While option A is also forbidden as written (`7D1` is not a valid NN state), the violation in option B is directly related to the specific Pauli statistics rule that the question instructs us to use.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo determine which of the proposed reactions is not permitted, we must check each one against the fundamental conservation laws of physics: conservation of angular momentum, conservation of parity, and the Pauli exclusion principle for the two-nucleon system.\n\n### **1. Initial State and Conservation Rules**\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`)**: The two-nucleon (NN) system starts in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can deduce its quantum numbers:\n    *   Total Spin `S = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L = 0` (from the letter 'S')\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J = 0`\n*   **Parity**: The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Particle X**: The emitted particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`. The lowercase letter in each option (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X (`L_X`) relative to the final NN system.\n*   **Final State (`T(NN)=0`)**: The final NN system has an isospin of `T=0`.\n\nWe will use the following three rules to test each reaction:\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of the final state must equal the initial state's total angular momentum (`J_initial = 0`). The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_NN`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`L_X`). For them to sum to zero, their magnitudes must be equal: `J_NN = L_X`.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity**: The total parity must be the same before and after the reaction.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   `P(NN_initial) = P(NN_final) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^L_NN * (-1) * (-1)^L_X`\n    *   This simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L_NN + L_X)`, which means the sum `L_NN + L_X` must be **odd**.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: The problem provides a specific formulation for the final state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, the rule becomes `0 = S_NN + L_NN + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires the sum `S_NN + L_NN` to be **odd**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's check each proposed reaction against these three rules.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN State (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L_X=3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation**: `J_NN=3` and `L_X=3`. Rule is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation**: `L_NN + L_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle**: `S_NN + L_NN = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n*Conclusion*: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN State (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation**: `J_NN=1` and `L_X=1`. Rule is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation**: `L_NN + L_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle**: `S_NN + L_NN = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n*Conclusion*: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN State (`7D1`): `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L_X=1`.\n*   A crucial point here is that two nucleons, being spin-1/2 particles, can only combine to form a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). A total spin of `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, the final state `7D1` cannot exist.\n*Conclusion*: This transition is **not permitted** because the final NN state is physically impossible.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN State (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L_X=0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation**: `J_NN=0` and `L_X=0`. Rule is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation**: `L_NN + L_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle**: `S_NN + L_NN = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S+L` must be odd for a `T=0` state.\n*Conclusion*: This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n### **3. Final Decision**\n\nBoth reactions C and D are forbidden. However, they are forbidden for different reasons.\n*   Reaction (D) is forbidden because it directly violates the Pauli principle as stated in the problem's conditions. All conservation laws are met, but the quantum numbers of the final state are inconsistent with the Pauli principle for a T=0 state.\n*   Reaction (C) is forbidden on more fundamental grounds: the final `7D1` state is not a possible state for a two-nucleon system, as a spin of S=3 cannot be formed.\n\nWithin the context of this type of physics problem, one is expected to apply the specific rules given. Reaction (D) fails one of the explicitly provided rules (the Pauli statistics equation), while reaction (C) technically satisfies all the given rules, but describes a transition to a non-existent state. The violation in (D) is a direct failure of the problem's specific constraints.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the forbidden transition:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State (NN):** `1S0`. This term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us:\n        *   Spin `S_i = 0`\n        *   Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`\n        *   Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`\n        *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   **Final State (NN + X):** This consists of a new two-nucleon state `NN_f` and an emitted particle `X`.\n        *   `NN_f` is described by the term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n        *   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1` (given).\n        *   The orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to the `NN_f` system is `l_f` (given by the lowercase letter: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws and Principles:** A transition is only permitted if it obeys all relevant physical laws. We must check the following for each option:\n    *   **Possibility of the NN State:** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles (proton, neutron). Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state requiring another value of `S` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem gives the rule for the final two-nucleon state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are told to assume the final state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`. The rule thus becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. Any final `NN_f` state where `S_f + L_f` is even is forbidden.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n        *   `P_initial = P_final`\n        *   `P_i = +1`\n        *   `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_orbital) * P(X_intrinsic) = (-1)^L_f * (-1)^l_f * (-1)`\n        *   So, we must have `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_f + 1)`. This means the exponent `L_f + l_f + 1` must be even, which implies `L_f + l_f` must be **odd**.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved (`J_i = J_f`). Since `J_i = 0`, the total angular momentum of the final state must be 0. The final angular momentum is a vector sum of the `NN_f` total angular momentum `J_f` and the angular momentum of particle X (its orbital `l_f` and spin `s_X`). It is always possible to find a suitable spin `s_X` to make this conservation work as long as the other rules are satisfied, so this rule is less restrictive than the others for this problem.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Option:** We will apply these checks sequentially. A failure at any step means the transition is not permitted. The most fundamental check is whether the state can exist at all.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_transition(option, name, s_nn, l_nn_char, l_x_char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a nuclear transition based on physical principles.\n    Prints the step-by-step analysis.\n    Returns \"Permitted\" or \"Forbidden\".\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing Option {option}: {name} ---\")\n\n    # Map character notation to integer quantum numbers\n    L_MAP = {'S': 0, 'P': 1, 'D': 2, 'F': 3}\n    l_map = {'s': 0, 'p': 1, 'd': 2, 'f': 3}\n    l_nn = L_MAP[l_nn_char]\n    l_x = l_map[l_x_char]\n\n    # 1.

We use the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)` to extract the quantum numbers.\n-   **Spin (S)**: `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the initial total spin `S_i = 0`.\n-   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L)**: The spectroscopic symbol `S` corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n-   **Total Angular Momentum (J)**: The subscript `0` gives the initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n-   **Parity (Π)**: The parity of an NN system is given by `Π = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `Π_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n-   **Isospin (T)**: The Pauli exclusion principle for nucleons states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that `L + S + T` must be an odd number. For the initial state, `L_i + S_i + T_i = 0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This requires the initial isospin to be `T_i = 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Final State and Applicable Rules\nThe initial system emits a particle `X` and transitions to a final NN state.\n-   **Final NN State**: Described by quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f`. The problem specifies that the final isospin is `T(NN) = T_f = 0`.\n-   **Particle X**: Has intrinsic parity `Π(X) = -1` and is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` (where `s`, `p`, `d`, `f` correspond to `l_X` = 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively).\n-   **Pauli Principle for Final State**: The question provides the relation `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `T+S+L` being odd. Given `T_f = 0`, the condition becomes `0 + S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n    -   **Rule 1: `S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n\n### Step 3: Apply Conservation Laws\nThe transition from the initial to the final state must conserve total parity and total angular momentum.\n\n-   **Parity Conservation**: The initial parity must equal the final total parity.\n    -   `Π_i = +1`.\n    -   The final parity `Π_f` is the product of the final NN parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the orbital parity of X: `Π_f = Π_f(NN) * Π(X) * Π_orbital(X) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X)`.\n    -   Setting `Π_i = Π_f`: `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    -   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`.\n    -   **Rule 2: `L_f + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n-   **Total Angular Momentum Conservation**: The initial total angular momentum must equal the final total angular momentum.\n    -   `J_i = 0`.\n    -   The final total angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the angular momentum of particle X. Assuming particle X is a spin-0 boson (like a pion), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`. This is a standard assumption in such problems unless otherwise specified.\n    -   Therefore, `J_final` is the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X`. For this sum to be zero (`J_final = J_i = 0`), the magnitudes must be equal.\n    -   **Rule 3: `J_f = l_X`**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Each Option\nWe now apply these three rules to each of the proposed final states.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n-   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2` (D-state). `J_f=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n-   *Note*: `S_f=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only couple to a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Thus, this state cannot be formed. However, checking against the derived rules:\n    -   Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` odd?): `3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **Passes.**\n    -   Rule 2 (`L_f + l_X` odd?): `2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **Passes.**\n    -   Rule 3 (`J_f = l_X`?): `1 = 1`. **Passes.**\n    -   The transition is forbidden because the final state is impossible, not because it violates the transition rules.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n-   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`. `L_f=0`. `J_f=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n-   Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` odd?): `1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **Passes.**\n-   Rule 2 (`L_f + l_X` odd?): `0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **Passes.**\n-   Rule 3 (`J_f = l_X`?): `1 = 1`. **Passes.**\n-   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n-   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`. `L_f=1`. `J_f=0`.\n-   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X = 0`.\n-   Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` odd?): `1 + 1 = 2` (even). **FAILS.**\n-   The transition violates the Pauli principle for the final T=0 state. We can stop here.\n-   This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n-   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`. `L_f=2`. `J_f=3`.\n-   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X = 3`.\n-   Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` odd?): `1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **Passes.**\n-   Rule 2 (`L_f + l_X` odd?): `2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **Passes.**\n-   Rule 3 (`J_f = l_X`?): `3 = 3`. **Passes.**\n-   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle requirement that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a final NN state with `T_f = 0`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe problem asks us to identify which of the four given decay processes is not permitted. The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state, which emits a particle `X` with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state is specified to have isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n\nWe must check each option against three constraints:\n1.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which simplifies to `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    *   Initial Parity (`P_i`): The state is `1S0`, so the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`. Parity is `(-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   Final Parity (`P_f`): This is the product of the final NN state's parity, the intrinsic parity of particle `X`, and the parity from the orbital motion of `X`. `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   For `P_i = P_f`, we must have `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`. This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n3.  **Total Angular Momentum (J) Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   Initial `J`: The state is `1S0`, so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   Final `J`: This is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the angular momentum of particle `X`. Assuming particle `X` is spinless (like a pion), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`. So, `J_{total, f} = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   Conservation requires `J_i = J_{total, f}`. Since `J_i=0`, `J_f` and `l_X` must be equal in magnitude. `J_f = l_X`.\n\nLet's evaluate each option using these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle `X` in `p` state: `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n    This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle `X` in `f` state: `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n    This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle `X` in `s` state: `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f = 0` state.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n    Because this transition violates the Pauli principle condition, it is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f + 1 = 7` implies `S_f = 3`. `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle `X` in `p` state: `l_X = 1`.\nThis option has a fundamental problem: a system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S = 0` (singlet) or `S = 1` (triplet). A state with `S = 3` (`2S+1=7`) is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this decay is not permitted because the final state cannot exist.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth C and D describe non-permitted processes. However, C is forbidden because it violates one of the explicit selection rules given in the problem (the Pauli statistics rule). D is forbidden because the final state is unphysical, a fact that is external to the listed selection rules. In the context of this question, we are expected to apply the given rules to find the contradiction. Option C is the only one that fails the check based on the explicitly stated rules of the transition process.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   **Term Symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:** `1S0`\n*   **Total Spin `S(NN_initial)`:** `2S+1 = 1` → `S = 0`\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial)`:** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial)`:** The subscript '0' gives `J = 0`.\n*   **Parity `P(initial)`:** The parity of the NN system is given by `(-1)^L`. Here, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe initial system decays into a final NN state and a particle X: `1S0 -> (NN)_final + X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. We will assume particle X has spin `S(X) = 0`, as is common for emitted particles like pions in such problems. The lowercase letter (`s, p, f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X, `L(X)`.\n*   **Final State Parity:** The total parity of the final state is `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^L(X)`. Since `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)` and `P(X)=-1`, this becomes `P(final) = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`.\n\nWe must check three conservation/selection rules:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J=0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J(NN_final)`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`J(X)`). Since we assume `S(X)=0`, `J(X) = L(X)`. For the total to be zero, we must have `J(NN_final) = L(X)`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The initial parity must equal the final parity.\n    `P(initial) = P(final)`\n    `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X) + 1)`\n    This requires the exponent `L(NN_final) + L(X) + 1` to be an even number, which means **`L(NN_final) + L(X)` must be an odd number.**\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given that the final isospin is `T(NN) = 0`, we have:\n    `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that **`S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an odd number.**\n\n### 3. Analyze the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN State (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L(X)=3`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J(NN_final) = L(X)`? `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_final) + L(X)` is odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN State (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L(X)=0`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J(NN_final) = L(X)`? `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_final) + L(X)` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (FAIL - it is even)\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN State (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J(NN_final) = L(X)`? `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_final) + L(X)` is odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN State (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` → `S=3`.\n*   This state is not possible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, this transition is fundamentally not permitted because the final state cannot exist.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe have identified two non-permitted transitions:\n*   **B)** is forbidden by the Pauli statistics selection rule provided in the problem.\n*   **D)** is forbidden because the proposed final state (`7D1`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n\nThe question asks to make use of the specified conservation laws and the Pauli rule. Option (B) is the one that fails these explicit checks on the transition dynamics. Option (D), while impossible, would formally satisfy all three transition rules if such a state could exist. Therefore, the question is most likely targeting the violation of the transition rules themselves.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the partial waves is not permitted.\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three conservation laws and one statistical rule:\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The quantum numbers of the final two-nucleon (NN) system must adhere to the given relation `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n\nLet's first analyze the initial state and the conditions for the final state.\n\n**Initial State: `1S0`**\n*   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have `2S+1 = 1` ⇒ `S = 0`.\n*   The letter 'S' denotes the orbital angular momentum `L = 0`.\n*   The subscript gives the total angular momentum `J = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial NN state is given by `P(NN_i) = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**Particle X**\n*   It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n*   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter: `s` (L=0), `p` (L=1), `d` (L=2), `f` (L=3).\n*   We will assume particle X has no intrinsic spin (`S(X) = 0`), which is a standard assumption for particles like pions denoted this way. Its total angular momentum is therefore `J(X) = L(X)`.\n\n**Conditions for the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics:**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, the isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`. Using the given Pauli statistics relation:\n    `T(NN_f) = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    `0 = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that the sum `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f)` must be **odd**. Any final NN state where `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f)` is even is forbidden.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:**\n    `P(initial) = P(final)`\n    `P(NN_i) = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^L(X)`\n    `(+1) = (-1)^L(NN_f) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`\n    `(+1) = (-1) * (-1)^(L(NN_f) + L(X))`\n    This requires `(-1)^(L(NN_f) + L(X))` to be `-1`, which means the sum `L(NN_f) + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:**\n    `J(initial) = J(final)`\n    The initial angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`.\n    The final total angular momentum `J(final)` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum `J(NN_f)` and particle X's angular momentum `J(X)`. To sum to zero, they must be equal in magnitude: `J(NN_f) = J(X)`.\n    Since we assume `S(X)=0`, we have `J(X) = L(X)`.\n    Therefore, the condition is `J(NN_f) = L(X)`.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Parity check:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 0+1 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **AM check:** `J(NN_f) = 1`, `L(X) = 1`.

Define the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   Term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`: `1S0`\n*   Total Spin `S(NN_initial)`: `2S+1 = 1` implies `S=0`.\n*   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial)`: The letter `S` corresponds to `L=0`.\n*   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial)`: The subscript is `0`, so `J=0`.\n*   Parity `P(NN_initial)`: The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `(-1)^L`. So, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe system decays into a final two-nucleon state `(NN)_final` and a particle `X`.\n*   `(NN)_final` is described by the term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n*   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is in an orbital angular momentum state `l(X)` relative to the `NN_final` system (denoted by s, p, d, f for `l(X)`=0, 1, 2, 3 respectively).\nWe must apply three main rules: Pauli Statistics, Conservation of Angular Momentum, and Conservation of Parity.\n\n#### Rule 1: Pauli Statistics\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nGiven that the final state has isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`:\n*   `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n*   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd number**.\n\n#### Rule 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum\nThe total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n*   `J_initial = J_final`\n*   `J_initial` is `0` from the `1S0` state.\n*   `J_final` is the vector sum of the final nucleon system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`j(X)`). `j(X)` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l(X)` and its intrinsic spin `s(X)`.\n*   Assuming particle X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion, which is common in such problems and has intrinsic parity -1), then `s(X) = 0` and `j(X) = l(X)`.\n*   The conservation law becomes `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_f) + vec(l(X))`.\n*   `0 = vec(J_f) + vec(l(X))`. This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l(X)`.\n\n#### Rule 3: Conservation of Parity\nThe total parity `P` must be conserved.\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_initial = +1`.\n*   `P_final` is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P(NN)_f`), the intrinsic parity of X (`P(X)`), and the orbital parity of X's motion (`P(l(X))`).\n*   `P(NN)_f = (-1)^L_f`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `P(l(X)) = (-1)^l(X)`\n*   So, the equation is: `+1 = ((-1)^L_f) * (-1) * ((-1)^l(X))`.\n*   `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l(X))`\n*   This implies that `(-1)^(L_f + l(X))` must be equal to `-1`.\n*   Therefore, `L_f + l(X)` must be an **odd number**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nWe will check each option against these three conditions:\n1.  `S_f + L_f` is odd.\n2.  `J_f = l(X)` (assuming `s(X)=0`).\n3.  `L_f + l(X)` is odd.\n\n---\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   This notation is unusual for a two-nucleon system as `2S+1=7` implies `S=3`, which is not possible for two spin-1/2 nucleons. However, we will test it against the given rules.\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2` (D-wave), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l(X) = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = l(X)` -> `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l(X) = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is technically allowed by the rules as stated, despite the physical impossibility of the `S_f=3` state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0` (S-wave), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l(X) = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = l(X)` -> `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2` (D-wave), `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X state (`f`): `l(X) = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = l(X)` -> `3 = 3`. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1` (P-wave), `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X state (`s`): `l(X) = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (**even**). **VIOLATION.**\n2.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = l(X)` -> `0 = 0`. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition violates the Pauli statistics requirement for the final two-nucleon state.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because the final `NN` state `3P0` (`S_f=1`, `L_f=1`) has `S_f + L_f = 2`, which is an even number. This violates the Pauli statistics rule (`S_f + L_f` must be odd) for a `T_f=0` final state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and General Rules\n\n*   **Initial NN State:** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have `1S0` => `2S_i+1=1`, `L_i=S`, `J_i=0`.\n    *   This gives:\n        *   Initial total spin: `S_i = 0`\n        *   Initial total orbital angular momentum: `L_i = 0`\n        *   Initial total angular momentum: `J_i = 0`\n    *   Initial Parity (`P_i`): The parity of the NN system is `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   Initial Isospin (`T_i`): We use the given Pauli statistics rule: `T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   `T_i = S_i + L_i + 1 (mod 2) = 0 + 0 + 1 (mod 2) = 1`.\n        *   So, the initial state has isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity: `P_X = -1` (given).\n    *   Orbital angular momentum: `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f...).\n    *   Spin: `S_X`. This is not given. We'll assume it can take any value required to conserve angular momentum, unless a specific value is forced.\n\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   Isospin: `T_{f,NN} = 0` (given).\n    *   The state is described by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    *   Parity: `P_{f,NN} = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n\n### 2. Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against conservation laws and the given Pauli rule.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. `J_i = J_{final_total}`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`), the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`), and the spin of particle X (`S_X`): `vec{J}_{final_total} = vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X + vec{S}_X`.\n    *   So, we must have `vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X + vec{S}_X = 0`. This implies that a valid (integer or half-integer) spin `S_X` must exist that satisfies the vector sum. This is possible if `|J_f - l_X| <= S_X <= J_f + l_X`. In the special case where `vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X = 0`, then `S_X` must be 0. More commonly in such problems, a simplifying assumption that particle X is spinless (`S_X=0`) is made. This simplifies the condition to `vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X = 0`, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`. Let's test this simpler condition first.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved. `P_i = P_{final}`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   `P_{final} = P_{f,NN} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X}` (Parity of final NN state * intrinsic parity of X * orbital parity of X).\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for Final State:** The rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)` must hold for the final NN state.\n    *   We are given `T_{f,NN} = 0`.\n    *   `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three constraints.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **This violates the condition.**\n*   The final NN state `3P0` has `S+L = 2` (even), which requires it to have isospin `T=1` according to the rule. The problem requires the final state to have `T=0`. Thus, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f = 3`.\n*   This state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Each nucleon has spin 1/2. Their total spin can only be `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet state) or `S = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0` (singlet state). `S=3` cannot be formed.\n*   Because the proposed final state cannot exist, the transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have found two \"not permitted\" transitions: B and C.\n*   **C** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is impossible for two nucleons (`S_f` cannot be 3). This is a violation of the fundamental properties of the NN system.\n*   **B** is forbidden because the final NN state (`3P0`) has `S_f+L_f=2` (even), which according to the provided Pauli rule, must have `T=1`. This contradicts the given condition that `T_{f,NN}=0`. This violation is a direct application of the rules the question instructed to use.\n\nIn physics problems of this type, one is typically expected to apply the given process rules (conservation laws, specific principles like the Pauli rule) to the options. The violation in option B is a failure to satisfy the Pauli statistics rule for the required isospin, which is one of the specific rules to be checked. The issue in option C is with the definition of the state itself, which is arguably a more fundamental error but might be a typo in the question. Given the explicit instruction to use the Pauli statistics rule, the violation found in option B is the most direct and intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n-   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system.\n-   `1S0` means:\n    -   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    -   `L = S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    -   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n-   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n-   According to the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that the sum `L + S + T` must be an odd integer, where T is the total isospin.\n-   For the initial state: `L_i + S_i + T_i` must be odd. `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which implies the initial isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe decay process is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\nThe final state consists of the two nucleons `NN(final)` and the emitted particle `X`.\n\nWe need to check three conditions for each proposed reaction:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem provides the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. It also specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n    -   Substituting `T=0` into the formula gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    -   This is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which means `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n    -   This is the same as the standard condition `S_f + L_f + T_f` must be odd, since `T_f=0`.\n\n2.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. `J_i = J_f_total`.\n    -   `J_i = 0`.\n    -   The final total angular momentum `J_f_total` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the angular momentum of particle X.\n    -   The problem denotes the orbital angular momentum of X with a lowercase letter (s, p, d, f...). We'll assume particle X is spinless (`s_X=0`), so its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n    -   Conservation `J_i = 0` requires the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X` to be zero, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n3.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity must be conserved. `P_i = P_f`.\n    -   `P_i = +1`.\n    -   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n    -   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n    -   The intrinsic parity of X is given as `P(X) = -1`.\n    -   The parity associated with the relative orbital motion of X is `(-1)^(l_X)`.\n    -   So, `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    -   Conservation `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)` requires `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`. This means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an odd integer.\n\n**Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition:**\n-   **Condition 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n-   **Condition 2 (J-conservation):** `J_f = l_X`.\n-   **Condition 3 (P-conservation):** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions. A transition is not permitted if it fails even one condition.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n-   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n-   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n-   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  Pauli: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the condition that the sum must be odd.\n    2.  J-conservation: `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n    3.  P-conservation: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n-   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n-   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n-   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n-   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  Pauli: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  J-conservation: `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n    3.  P-conservation: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). Satisfied.\n-   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n-   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n-   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  Pauli: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  J-conservation: `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n    3.  P-conservation: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). Satisfied.\n-   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n-   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` => `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n-   **Note on physical possibility:** A two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is fundamentally not permitted because the final state cannot exist.\n-   However, if we strictly follow the rules provided in the question:\n    1.  Pauli: `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  J-conservation: `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n    3.  P-conservation: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). Satisfied.\n-   This transition satisfies all the explicitly mentioned conservation laws and the provided Pauli rule. The reason it is forbidden is due to a more fundamental principle of angular momentum addition not explicitly listed as a test criterion. In contrast, option A fails one of the explicitly provided criteria. Therefore, A is the intended answer.\n\nBased on the analysis, the transition in option A is the only one that violates the selection rules given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and the Reaction\n- **Initial State:** The system starts as a bound two-nucleon (NN) state `1S0`. We can decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n    - `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the nucleon pair is `S(NN)_initial = 0`.\n    - `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L(NN)_initial = 0`.\n    - `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum of the initial system is `J_initial = 0`.\n- **Initial Parity:** The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n- **The Reaction:** The initial NN system emits a particle X, leading to a final state composed of the NN pair and particle X: `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n- **Particle X:**\n    - It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    - It has an orbital angular momentum `l_X`, where the lowercase letters correspond to `s=0`, `p=1`, `d=2`, `f=3`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Governing Rules and Conservation Laws\nFor a reaction to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant conservation laws and quantum mechanical rules. We will formulate three specific conditions to check based on the problem statement.\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_initial = J_final_total`.\n*   The initial state has `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The final state's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum `J(NN)_final` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`. So, `J_final_total = J(NN)_final + l_X` (vector sum).\n*   The conservation law is `0 = J(NN)_final + l_X`. This vector equation can only be satisfied if the magnitudes of the two angular momenta are equal: `J(NN)_final = l_X`.\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n*   `P_initial = P_final_total`.\n*   We know `P_initial = +1`.\n*   The final state's parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_final_total = P(NN)_final * P(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n    *   `P(NN)_final = (-1)^(L(NN)_final)`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_orbital(X)` is the parity associated with the relative motion of X, which is `(-1)^l_X`.\n*   The conservation equation becomes `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN)_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN)_final + l_X + 1)`.\n*   For this to be true, the exponent `L(NN)_final + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This means `L(NN)_final + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\nThe problem provides a specific condition that the final NN state must satisfy due to the Pauli exclusion principle for `T(NN)=0`.\n*   Given Rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   Given Condition: The final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n*   Substituting the condition into the rule: `0 = S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   For this equality to hold, `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1` must be an even number (since any even number modulo 2 is 0).\n*   This implies that `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Proposed Transition\n\nWe will now test each option against the three derived conditions. A transition is forbidden if it fails even one of them.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J(NN)_final = 3`, `l_X = 3`. They are equal. **(Pass)**\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L(NN)_final + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **(Pass)**\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **(Pass)**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J(NN)_final = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **(Pass)**\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L(NN)_final + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **(Pass)**\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **(Pass)**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7 -> S=3`. `L=D -> L=2`. `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J(NN)_final = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **(Pass)**\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L(NN)_final + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **(Pass)**\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **(Pass)**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted by the rules given in the question. (Note: In physical reality, a two-nucleon system cannot have a total spin S=3, making this state impossible, but it does not violate the specific rules the question asks to check).\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J(NN)_final = 0`, `l_X = 0`. They are equal. **(Pass)**\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L(NN)_final + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **(Pass)**\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(FAIL)**\n*   Conclusion: **Not Permitted.** The sum `S+L` for the final `3P0` state is even, which violates the provided Pauli statistics condition for a `T=0` state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis**\n\nThe initial state of the two-nucleon (NN) system is `1S0`. Using the `(2S+1)L(J)` notation:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the initial total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` implies the initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The number `0` implies the initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The initial parity is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Conservation Laws and Selection Rules**\n\nWe must check each proposed final state against several rules:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Physicality of the Final NN State**\n    A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin `S` of 0 (singlet state) or 1 (triplet state). Any final state with a spin other than 0 or 1 is physically impossible. This corresponds to the `2S_f+1` value being 1 or 3.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\n    The total parity of the system must be conserved. The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the parity of the final NN state `P_f = (-1)^L_f` and the parity of the emitted particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1 and is in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X`, so its total parity is `P_X_total = (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    The conservation equation is `P_i = P_f * P_X_total`.\n    `+1 = ((-1)^L_f) * ((-1) * (-1)^l_X)`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd number**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for T(NN) = 0**\n    The problem states that for the final state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that the final NN state has `T(NN) = 0`. Substituting this in:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which in turn means that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd number**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Angular Momentum Conservation**\n    The total angular momentum must be conserved: `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) + vec(J_X)`.\n    Since `J_i = 0`, we must have `vec(J_f) = -vec(J_X)`, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = J_X`. `J_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X, which depends on its unknown spin `S_X`. This rule is less restrictive than the others and is usually satisfied if the other rules are.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Options**\n\nWe now apply these rules to each option. A transition is forbidden if it violates any rule.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final State `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`. Particle `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (State Physicality): `S_f=1` is valid. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli for T=0): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: Permitted.**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final State `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. Particle `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (State Physicality): `S_f=3` is not a possible spin for a two-nucleon system. (VIOLATION)\n*   **Conclusion: Not permitted.**\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final State `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`. Particle `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   Rule 1 (State Physicality): `S_f=1` is valid. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli for T=0): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the requirement that `S_f + L_f` be odd. (VIOLATION)\n*   **Conclusion: Not permitted.**\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final State `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`. Particle `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (State Physicality): `S_f=1` is valid. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli for T=0): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: Permitted.**\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBoth options B and C describe forbidden transitions.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons.\n*   Option C is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics selection rule that was explicitly given for a final state with `T(NN)=0`.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions where multiple options appear to be correct, it's often the case that one violates a rule specific to the process described in the question, while another violates a more general principle. The question explicitly gives the `T, S, L` relation derived from Pauli statistics as a condition to be checked. Option C fails this specific check. Option B fails a more fundamental check on the existence of the state itself. Often, such questions are designed to test the application of the specific rules mentioned. The violation in option C is a direct contradiction of the given formula under the given condition (`T(NN)=0`), making it the most direct answer to the problem as posed.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the fundamental conservation laws of physics: conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the rules governing the decay `1S0 -> NN_final + X`:\n\n1.  **Initial State (1S0 NN system):**\n    *   The term symbol `1S0` means the initial two-nucleon (NN) system has total spin `S=0`, orbital angular momentum `L=0`, and total angular momentum `J=0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   The generalized Pauli exclusion principle requires the total wavefunction of two identical fermions (the nucleons) to be antisymmetric. This implies that the quantity `L+S+T` must be an odd number, where T is the total isospin. For the `1S0` state, `L=0` and `S=0`, so `0 + 0 + T` must be odd, which means the initial state has isospin `T=1`.\n\n2.  **Particle X:**\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity of -1.\n    *   We assume particle X is a spin-0 particle (like a pseudoscalar meson, e.g., a pion), which is common in such nuclear processes.\n\n3.  **Final State (NN_final + X):**\n    *   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n4.  **Conservation Laws and Selection Rules:**\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle (for the final NN state):** The prompt provides the condition `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. With `T(NN) = 0`, this simplifies to `S(NN) + L(NN) + 1` being an even number, which means `S(NN) + L(NN)` must be **odd**.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n        *   `P(initial) = P(NN_initial) = +1`\n        *   `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l(X)`, where `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)` and `l(X)` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X.\n        *   `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`\n        *   This requires `-1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l(X))`, meaning `L(NN_final) + l(X)` must be **odd**.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n        *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n        *   `J(final)` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum, `J(NN_final)`, and the angular momentum of particle X. Assuming `S(X)=0`, this is `J(final) = J(NN_final) + l(X)`.\n        *   For the sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN_final) = l(X)`.\n\nNow, we will test each option against these three rules:\n1.  `L(f) + S(f)` must be odd.\n2.  `L(f) + l(X)` must be odd.\n3.  `J(f) = l(X)`.\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l(X)=3`.\n1.  `L+S = 2+1 = 3` (odd) -> **OK**\n2.  `L+l(X) = 2+3 = 5` (odd) -> **OK**\n3.  `J=3`, `l(X)=3` -> **OK**\n*This transition is permitted.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S+1=7` implies `S=3`. A two-nucleon system, composed of two spin-1/2 particles, can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, the `7D1` state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. While this immediately makes the transition not permitted, it is likely a typo in the question. If we assume it should be a valid state like `3D1`, the transition would be permitted. Let's analyze the other options, as the question likely intends to test the application of the selection rules.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l(X)=0`.\n1.  `L+S = 1+1 = 2` (even) -> **FAIL**. This violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n2.  `L+l(X) = 1+0 = 1` (odd) -> **OK**\n3.  `J=0`, `l(X)=0` -> **OK**\n*This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state.*\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l(X)=1`.\n1.  `L+S = 0+1 = 1` (odd) -> **OK**\n2.  `L+l(X) = 0+1 = 1` (odd) -> **OK**\n3.  `J=1`, `l(X)=1` -> **OK**\n*This transition is permitted.*\n\n---\nBased on the analysis, the transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is forbidden because the final `3P0` state, with `L=1` and `S=1`, does not satisfy the Pauli principle condition (`L+S` must be odd) for a two-nucleon system with isospin `T=0`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nBased on the principles of nuclear physics, the partial wave that is not permitted is **C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasons:\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis:** The initial system is two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n        *   `2S+1 = 1` implies total spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`.\n        *   `L = S` (S-wave) implies orbital angular momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`.\n        *   `J = 0` implies total angular momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   The generalized Pauli principle requires that the total wavefunction of two identical fermions (like nucleons) be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule that `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where T is the total isospin. For the initial state, `0 + 0 + T` must be odd, which means `T(NN_initial) = 1`.\n\n2.  **Conservation Laws and Final State Conditions:**\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The initial total angular momentum is `J=0`. Assuming the emitted particle X is a pseudoscalar meson (like a pion with spin 0), the total angular momentum of the final NN state `J(NN_final)` must be equal to the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `L(X)`.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The overall parity must be conserved. The initial parity is `+1`. The final parity is `P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^L(X)`. Given that the intrinsic parity of X is `P(X) = -1`, the conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`. This simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X))`, meaning `L(NN_final) + L(X)` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Pauli Principle for the Final State:** The problem states that `T(NN_final) = 0` and that the final state must obey `T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`. With T=0, this means `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`, which simplifies to `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` being an odd number.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p:** The final NN state is `3S1` (`S=1, L=0, J=1`) and X has `L(X)=1`.\n        *   **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+0=1` (odd). **OK**.\n        *   **Angular Momentum:** `J=L(X)` -> `1=1`. **OK**.\n        *   **Parity:** `L+L(X)` odd -> `0+1=1`. **OK**.\n        *   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n    *   **B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f:** The final NN state is `3D3` (`S=1, L=2, J=3`) and X has `L(X)=3`.\n        *   **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+2=3` (odd). **OK**.\n        *   **Angular Momentum:** `J=L(X)` -> `3=3`. **OK**.\n        *   **Parity:** `L+L(X)` odd -> `2+3=5`. **OK**.\n        *   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n    *   **C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p:** The final NN state is specified as `7D1`.\n        *   This term symbol implies `2S+1 = 7`, which would mean the total spin of the two-nucleon system is `S=3`.\n        *   However, nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. When combining two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can only be `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet state) or `S = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0` (singlet state).\n        *   It is fundamentally impossible for a two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3`. Therefore, the final state `7D1` cannot exist for a two-nucleon system. This makes the transition **not permitted**.\n\n    *   **D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s:** The final NN state is `3P0` (`S=1, L=1, J=0`) and X has `L(X)=0`.\n        *   **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+1=2` (even). This violates the condition that `S+L` must be odd for a `T=0` state. Therefore, a `3P0` state with `T=0` is forbidden by the generalized Pauli principle. This transition is also **not permitted**.\n\nBoth options C and D represent forbidden transitions because the proposed final NN state is not physically possible. However, the reason for option C being impossible is more fundamental. The term symbol `7D1` describes a state that is inconsistent with the basic composition of a two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles). The violation in option D requires applying the more nuanced generalized Pauli principle that links orbital, spin, and isospin symmetries. Therefore, the `7D1` state is more flagrantly incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\nThe decay process is:\nInitial Nucleon-Nucleon state (NN_i) → Final Nucleon-Nucleon state (NN_f) + Particle X\n\nWe must check each option against the following physical laws and principles described in the problem:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**: The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P)**: The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle for Nucleons**: For a two-nucleon system, the total state must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that the sum of the orbital angular momentum (L), total spin (S), and isospin (T) quantum numbers must be odd: `L + S + T = odd`. The problem provides an equivalent formula: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n\nLet's first establish the properties of the initial and final states based on the problem description.\n\n### Initial State: `1S0`\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` for `1S0` gives:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1`  ⇒  `S(NN)_i = 0`\n    *   `L` is 'S'   ⇒  `L(NN)_i = 0`\n    *   `J` is 0     ⇒  `J(NN)_i = 0`\n*   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^L(NN)_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### Final State: `NN_f + X`\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is emitted in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3). We assume X is a scalar particle (spin `s_X = 0`).\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n\nNow let's derive the specific selection rules for this decay.\n\n**1. Angular Momentum Conservation (`J_i = J_f`)**:\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the NN state's angular momentum `J(NN)_f` and the particle X's total angular momentum `j_X`. Since we assume `s_X=0`, `j_X = l_X`.\n*   So, `J_f = J(NN)_f + l_X` (vector sum). For `J_f` to be 0, we must have `J(NN)_f = l_X`.\n\n**2. Parity Conservation (`P_i = P_f`)**:\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN)_f * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   `P(NN)_f = (-1)^L(NN)_f`.\n*   `+1 = (-1)^L(NN)_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L(NN)_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   For this to be true, the exponent `L(NN)_f + l_X + 1` must be even, which means `L(NN)_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n**3. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State (`T_f + S_f + L_f = odd`)**:\n*   The problem states `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n*   Therefore, the condition becomes `S(NN)_f + L(NN)_f` must be **odd**.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option against these three rules.\n\n---\n### A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S+1=7` ⇒ `S_f=3`. `L=D` ⇒ `L_f=2`. `J_f=1`.\n*   A state with `S=3` cannot be formed from two spin-1/2 nucleons, whose total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.

The problem explicitly provides the formula for the Pauli principle and specifies the final isospin state `T=0`. This suggests that the primary skill being tested is the application of all selection rules, particularly the non-trivial Pauli constraint. Option (C) is forbidden precisely by this rule, after satisfying the conservation laws of angular momentum and parity. The issue with option (A) is a more basic error in the construction of a valid quantum state for two nucleons, which could potentially be a typo (`7` instead of `3`). Assuming the question is designed to test the detailed selection rules provided, the violation in (C) is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To decide the final answer, a comprehensive analysis of the given nuclear transition problem is required. We will break down the initial state, establish the rules for a permitted transition based on the provided information, and then systematically evaluate each option.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State and Define the Rules\n\n1.  **Initial State (`1S0`)**: The two-nucleon (NN) system starts in a `1S0` state. From the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)`, we deduce its quantum numbers:\n    *   Total Spin (`S_i`): `2S_i + 1 = 1` → `S_i = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum (`L_i`): The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   Total Angular Momentum (`J_i`): The subscript '0' gives `J_i = 0`.\n    *   Parity (`P_i`): The parity of the NN system is `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n2.  **General Conditions for a Permitted Transition**: The decay `NN(initial) → NN(final) + X` must satisfy several rules.\n    *   The particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n\nWe must check each option against the following three selection rules derived from the problem statement:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**: The problem provides the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. With `T(NN)_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. For this to be true, the sum `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which means **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**: The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state (`P_i = P_f`).\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity, particle X's intrinsic parity, and the orbital parity of X: `P_f = P(NN)_f * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   Substituting known values: `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The initial total angular momentum (`J_i = 0`) must equal the final total angular momentum. Assuming particle X is spinless (a common convention), the final angular momentum is the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X`. For this sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now apply these rules to each of the proposed transitions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p-wave`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. Rule `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` → `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p-wave`: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Physicality of the State.** A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only form a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A total spin of `S=3` is physically impossible for this system.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Not Permitted** because the proposed final state (`7D1`) cannot physically exist for a two-nucleon system.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s-wave`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that the sum must be odd for a `T=0` state.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. Rule `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Not Permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle constraint for the specified final state isospin.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f-wave`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. Rule `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Permitted**.\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted: **B** and **C**.\n\n*   Transition **(B)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system (`S=3` is not allowed). This is a violation of the fundamental composition of the system.\n*   Transition **(C)** is forbidden because the combination of a `3P0` state with an isospin `T=0` violates the generalized Pauli principle, a violation of the explicit rule provided in the problem statement.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Determining the Intended Answer.** When a physics problem presents multiple non-permitted options, one must evaluate the nature of the violations. The question explicitly asks the solver to make use of the Pauli statistics rule it provides. Option (C) is the transition that fails this specific test. The issue with option (B) is that the state itself is ill-defined for the system in question, which is often an indicator of a typographical error in the problem options. Therefore, the violation of the selection rule in option (C) is the intended answer, as it directly tests the application of the dynamics described in the problem.\n\n<<<C>>>"

We need to identify which of the given final states is not permitted based on conservation laws and Pauli statistics.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon system in a `1S0` state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is `S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is `0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial NN state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`. (Nucleons have intrinsic parity +1).\n\nThe generalized Pauli principle for a two-nucleon system states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, which implies `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, or that `L+S+T` must be an odd integer. For the initial state:\n*   `L_i + S_i + T_i = 0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This requires the isospin of the initial state to be `T_i = 1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system `(NN)_f` and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   The final NN state has quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and isospin `T_f`.\n*   The particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X`. The lowercase letters `s, p, d, f` correspond to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`, respectively.\n\nWe must apply the following rules:\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the final NN state:** The problem explicitly states this condition: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. Given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which simplifies to `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved, `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   `P_f = P((NN)_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   So, `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`, which means `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`. This requires `L_f + l_X` to be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum must be conserved, `J_i = J_f_total`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The total final angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle X's angular momentum. Assuming particle X is spinless (like a pion, s_X=0), its total angular momentum is just `l_X`.\n    *   So, `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum). With `J_i = 0`, this implies the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's check each proposed transition against these three conditions:\n1.  `S_f + L_f` is odd.\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd.\n3.  `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p-wave`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n    This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s-wave`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATION.**\n2.  `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n    This transition is not permitted because the final NN state `(3P0, T=0)` violates the Pauli principle.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f-wave`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n    This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p-wave`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n    This transition satisfies all the conservation laws and the Pauli condition as stated. However, a system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is also forbidden.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found two forbidden transitions:\n*   **B** is forbidden because the final NN state violates the Pauli principle as explicitly stated in the problem.\n*   **D** is forbidden because the final NN state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system (S cannot be 3).\n\nWhen a question has multiple technically correct answers, we must infer the intended focus. The question explicitly provides the Pauli statistics condition to be used. Option B is the only one that violates this specific rule. Option D violates a more fundamental, but unstated, principle. Therefore, the question is most likely designed to test the application of the rules it lays out. Based on this reasoning, B is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the laws of conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the given Pauli statistics requirement for the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### Summary of Initial State and Conservation Rules\n\n*   **Initial NN State (`1S0`):**\n    *   Total Spin: `S(NN_i) = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum: `L(NN_i) = 0`\n    *   Total Angular Momentum: `J(NN_i) = 0`\n    *   Parity: `P(NN_i) = (-1)^L(NN_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`\n\n*   **Emitted Particle (X):**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity: `P(X) = -1`\n\n*   **Conservation Laws & Conditions:**\n    1.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total initial angular momentum (`J(NN_i) = 0`) must equal the total final angular momentum.

Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State**: The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we get:\n        *   Total Spin `S_initial = 0` (since `2S+1=1`).\n        *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_initial = 0` (from the letter `S`).\n        *   Total Angular Momentum `J_initial = 0` (from the subscript `0`).\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Decay Process**: The decay is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system is `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws and Constraints**:\n    *   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**: `J_initial = J_final`. Since `J_initial = 0`, the final total angular momentum must also be 0. `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_NN_final`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the sum to be zero, we must have `J_NN_final = l_X`.\n    *   **Conservation of Parity (P)**: `P_initial = P_final`. The final parity is `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`. Since `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_NN_final` and `P(X) = -1`, we have `P_final = (-1)^L_NN_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`. For parity to be conserved (`+1 = P_final`), the exponent `L_NN_final + 1 + l_X` must be even. This means `L_NN_final + l_X` must be **odd**.\n    *   **Pauli Statistics for Final State**: The problem states that for the final NN state with `T(NN) = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_NN_final + L_NN_final + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that `S_NN_final + L_NN_final` must be **odd**.\n\n4.  **Check Each Option**: We will now write a Python script to apply these three rules to each of the given options.

Understand the Initial State and Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies initial total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` implies initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` implies initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Decay Process:** `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the final NN system is denoted by `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, ...).\n\n*   **Final State:** The final two-nucleon system `NN(final)` has quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and isospin `T_f`.\n\n*   **Conservation Laws and Constraints:**\n    1.  **Pauli Statistics (given):** For the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. The problem specifies that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n        *   Plugging this in: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n        *   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. This is our first selection rule.\n\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n        *   `P(initial) = P(final)`\n        *   `P(NN_initial) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital)`\n        *   `(-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^{L_f} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X}`\n        *   `(-1)^0 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`\n        *   `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`\n        *   This implies `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n        *   Therefore, `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number. This is our second selection rule.\n\n    3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state (vector sum).\n        *   `J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum), where `j_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X.\n        *   Since `J_i = 0`, we must have `J_f` and `j_X` coupled to zero, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n        *   The total angular momentum of particle X, `j_X`, is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its spin `s_X`. This means `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n        *   So, the condition is `|l_X - s_X| <= J_f <= l_X + s_X`.\n        *   A very common case (and a simplifying assumption if `s_X` is unknown or zero) is that `J_f = l_X`. Let's test this simpler rule first, as it's often sufficient. If a transition is forbidden under this simple rule, it's a strong candidate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Option**\n\nWe will check each proposed transition against our three rules:\n1.  `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  `J_f = l_X` (as a first check for angular momentum conservation).\n\n---\n**A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`. This is **even**. The rule requires it to be odd.\n    *   **This transition violates the Pauli principle.**\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the transition violates a fundamental principle, it is **not permitted**. We do not need to check further, but for completeness:\n    *   Rule 2 (Parity): `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n    *   Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.): `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n\n---\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   Note: `S_f=3` is not possible for a two-nucleon system (max spin is 1). However, we test against the given rules.\n\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5`. This is **odd**. Satisfied.\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3`. This is **odd**. Satisfied.\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted by all three selection rules.\n\n---\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1`. This is **odd**. Satisfied.\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1`. This is **odd**. Satisfied.\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n---\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3`.

Mom.):** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**3. Final Answer**\n\nThe only transition that violates the selection rules derived from the problem statement is option A. It fails the Pauli statistics requirement for the final state.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each proposed reaction against the fundamental conservation laws of physics and the given Pauli statistics constraint.\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can deduce its quantum numbers:\n*   **Total Spin (S_i):** `2S_i + 1 = 1`  =>  `S_i = 0`\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L_i):** The letter `S` corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J_i):** The number `0` gives `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P_i):** The parity of the NN system is `P_i(NN) = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Conservation Laws and Constraints\nFor the reaction `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X` to be permitted, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_i`) must equal the vector sum of the angular momenta of the final products. Assuming particle X has zero spin, this is `J_i = J_f(NN) + l_X` (vector sum), where `J_f(NN)` is the total angular momentum of the final NN state and `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X.\n    Since `J_i = 0`, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f(NN) = l_X`.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be conserved. The parity of the final state is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of X.\n    The conservation law is `P_i = P_f`, so `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    This simplifies to `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`, which requires that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Constraint 3: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This implies that `S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f(NN) + L_f(NN)` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's test each option against these three constraints. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Constraint 1: `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Constraint 2: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). (Pass)\n*   Constraint 3: `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). (Pass)\n*   **Result: Permitted**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Constraint 1: `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Constraint 2: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (Pass)\n*   Constraint 3: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Pass)\n*   **Result: Permitted**\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Constraint 1: `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `3 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   Constraint 2: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (Pass)\n*   Constraint 3: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (Pass)\n*   **Result: Permitted**\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   Constraint 1: `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `0 = 0`. (Pass)\n*   Constraint 2: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Pass)\n*   Constraint 3: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). (**Fail**)\n*   **Result: Not Permitted**\n\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle constraint for the final two-nucleon state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   **Parity of the initial state**: The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin of the initial state**: The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule that `L + S + T` must be an odd number. For the initial state, `L=0` and `S=0`, so `0 + 0 + T` must be odd, which means the isospin `T(NN_initial) = 1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe transition must obey several rules:\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final state consists of the NN pair and the emitted particle X. Assuming particle X has no intrinsic spin, the total angular momentum of the final system is the vector sum of the NN pair's total angular momentum (`J(NN_final)`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l(X)`).\n    *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   For `J(final)` to be 0, we must be able to couple `J(NN_final)` and `l(X)` to get 0. This is only possible if `J(NN_final) = l(X)`.\n*   **Conservation of Parity**: The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n    *   `P(initial) = +1`.\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l(X)`.\n    *   We are given that the intrinsic parity of X is `P(X) = -1`. The parity of the final NN state is `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)`.\n    *   So, `P(final) = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X) = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l(X))`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l(X))`, which simplifies to `(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l(X)) = -1`.\n    *   This means the sum `L(NN_final) + l(X)` must be **odd**.\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**: The problem states the condition `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T=0`, we get `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be **odd**. (Because an odd number plus 1 is even, which is 0 mod 2).\n    *   This condition is equivalent to the standard Pauli principle that `L+S+T` must be odd for a two-nucleon system. With `T=0`, `L+S` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each proposed transition against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l=1`.\n1.  **Angular Momentum:** Is `J(NN_final) = l(X)`? `1 = 1`. (Yes)\n2.  **Parity:** Is `L(NN_final) + l(X)` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (Yes)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Yes)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l=0`.\n1.  **Angular Momentum:** Is `J(NN_final) = l(X)`? `0 = 0`. (Yes)\n2.  **Parity:** Is `L(NN_final) + l(X)` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Yes)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (No, it's even)\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final two-nucleon state. The state `3P0` with `T=0` is forbidden for nucleons.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l=3`.\n1.  **Angular Momentum:** Is `J(NN_final) = l(X)`? `3 = 3`. (Yes)\n2.  **Parity:** Is `L(NN_final) + l(X)` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (Yes)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (Yes)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` implies `S=3`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (each with spin 1/2) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A total spin of `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Therefore, this transition is not permitted because the final state itself is not a valid two-nucleon state.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options B and D represent transitions that are not permitted. However, option D is forbidden because the proposed final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Option B is forbidden because it violates a specific selection rule (the Pauli principle for the final `T=0` state), even though the state `3P0` is a valid angular momentum state in principle. In physics problems of this nature, one typically evaluates the given options against the provided conservation laws and constraints. Option B is the only one that fails these explicit checks while being composed of otherwise valid quantum numbers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against three fundamental conservation laws and principles:\n\n1.  **Generalized Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** For a two-nucleon system, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the requirement that the sum of the orbital angular momentum (L), total spin (S), and total isospin (T) must be an odd integer: `L + S + T = odd`. The problem provides this rule in a different form for the final state where `T(NN) = 0`: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`, which means `S(NN) + L(NN)` must be odd.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   Initial State (`1S0`): The total angular momentum `J(initial)` is 0.\n    *   Final State (`NN + X`): The final total angular momentum `J(final)` is the vector sum of the final nucleon-nucleon state's angular momentum, `J(NN)`, and the angular momentum of particle X, `l(X)`.\n    *   For the transition to be allowed, `J(NN)` and `l(X)` must be able to couple to 0. This is only possible if `J(NN) = l(X)`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   Initial State (`1S0`): The parity is `P(initial) = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   Final State (`NN + X`): The parity is the product of the final NN state's parity `P(NN) = (-1)^L(NN)`, the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P(X) = -1`, given), and the parity of the relative orbital motion `P(orbital) = (-1)^l(X)`.\n    *   Therefore, `P(final) = (-1)^L(NN) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`.\n    *   The conservation law `P(initial) = P(final)` becomes `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN) + l(X))`. This simplifies to the condition that `L(NN) + l(X)` must be an odd number.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on these three conditions:\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   **Final NN State (`3P0`):** `S(NN) = 1`, `L(NN) = 1`, `J(NN) = 0`.\n*   **Particle X (`s` state):** `l(X) = 0`.\n*   **Pauli Principle Check:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). This violates the condition that `S(NN) + L(NN)` must be odd for a `T(NN) = 0` state.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is forbidden because the final `3P0` state with `T=0` is not allowed by the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n---\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   **Final NN State (`7D1`):** `S(NN) = 3`, `L(NN) = 2`, `J(NN) = 1`.\n*   **Particle X (`p` state):** `l(X) = 1`.\n*   **Pauli Principle Check:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd).

Since `T(NN_final) = 0`, this simplifies to `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`, which means that the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an **odd** number.\n    *   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_initial = 0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J(NN_final)`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`L(X)`). For the sum to be zero, it is required that `J(NN_final) = L(X)`.\n    *   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state (`P_initial = +1`) must equal the total parity of the final state. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P(X) = -1`), and the parity from the orbital motion of X (`(-1)^L(X)`). This gives the equation: `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`. This simplifies to requiring that the sum `L(NN_final) + L(X)` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\n| Option | Final NN State | S(NN) | L(NN) | J(NN) | Particle X | L(X) | Pauli Check (S+L odd?) | Parity Check (L(NN)+L(X) odd?) | Ang.

While it satisfies the conservation of angular momentum and parity, it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state. For the `³P₀` state, `S=1` and `L=1`, so the sum `S+L = 2`, which is an even number. However, the Pauli principle for a `T=0` final state requires this sum to be odd.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is `S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is `0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, meaning `L+S+T` must be an odd integer.\n    *   For the initial state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This implies the initial isospin `T_i` must be odd. The simplest case is `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and the Emitted Particle\nThe reaction is `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n*   The final two-nucleon state `NN_f` has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n*   The emitted particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum `l_X` of the particle `X` relative to the final `NN_f` system.\n    *   `s` => `l_X = 0`\n    *   `p` => `l_X = 1`\n    *   `f` => `l_X = 3`\n*   We assume the particle X is a meson (like a pion), which has spin `s_X = 0`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws and Fundamental Principles\n\nWe need to check each proposed reaction against the following rules:\n\n**Rule 1: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that Pauli statistics require `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nWe are given that the final state has `T_f = 0`.\nSubstituting this into the rule:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number. This, in turn, means that the sum of the final spin and orbital angular momentum, `S_f + L_f`, must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved.\n`J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum).\nSince we assume `s_X=0`, the total angular momentum of particle X is `j_X = l_X`.\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\nSo, `0 = J_f + l_X` (vector sum). This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal, i.e., `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 3: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity must be conserved.\n`P_i = P_f`\nThe initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\nThe final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the final particles and the parity of their relative orbital motion: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n*   Parity of relative motion is `(-1)^l_X`\nSo, the equation for parity conservation is:\n`+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n`+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\nThis simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 4: Validity of the NN State**\nA two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a different total spin is not a valid two-nucleon state.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's create a table to check each option against these four rules.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`) | `l_X` | Rule 1: `S_f+L_f` odd? | Rule 2: `J_f=l_X`? | Rule 3: `L_f+l_X` odd? | Rule 4: `S_f`=0 or 1? | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **A)** | `3P0` (`S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0`) | 0 | `1+1=2` (even) -> **No** | `0=0` -> Yes | `1+0=1` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=1` -> Yes | **No** |\n| **B)** | `3S1` (`S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1`) | 1 | `1+0=1` (odd) -> Yes | `1=1` -> Yes | `0+1=1` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=1` -> Yes | Yes |\n| **C)** | `7D1` (`S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1`) | 1 | `3+2=5` (odd) -> Yes | `1=1` -> Yes | `2+1=3` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=3` -> **No** | **No** |\n| **D)** | `3D3` (`S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3`) | 3 | `1+2=3` (odd) -> Yes | `3=3` -> Yes | `2+3=5` (odd) -> Yes | `S_f=1` -> Yes | Yes |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis, we find two forbidden transitions:\n*   **A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`:** This transition is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state (Rule 1). The sum `S_f + L_f = 2` is even, but for a `T_f=0` state, it must be odd.\n*   **C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`:** This transition is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is not a valid state for a two-nucleon system (Rule 4). A `7D1` state would require a total spin `S_f=3`, which is impossible for two spin-1/2 particles.\n\nSince the question asks for a single answer and explicitly provides the Pauli statistics condition (`T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`), it is most likely that the intended answer is the one that violates this specific rule. Option A is the only one that violates this rule. The state in option C is invalid for a more fundamental reason related to the system's composition, but it coincidentally satisfies the given Pauli rule and the conservation laws. Therefore, the violation highlighted by the problem statement points to A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `L` is `S` => Orbital angular momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `J` is `0` => Total angular momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial NN state is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P(NN_initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The generalized Pauli principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule that `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where `T` is the total isospin.\n    *   For the initial state: `L=0, S=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T` must be odd, which implies `T(NN_initial) = 1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n\n*   The final state consists of a new NN state and an emitted particle X.\n*   The particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN system is `l_X`.\n*   The final NN state has quantum numbers `S(NN_final)`, `L(NN_final)`, `J(NN_final)`, and isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n\nWe must check three conditions for the transition to be permitted:\n\n*   **Condition 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    *   The problem states that the final NN state must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This is equivalent to `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN)` being an odd number.\n    *   Since we are given `T(NN_final) = 0`, this simplifies to the condition that `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be odd.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    *   The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = P(NN_initial) = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital = (-1)^{L(NN_final)} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^{L(NN_final) + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   This requires the exponent to be even, which means `L(NN_final) + l_X` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Condition 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    *   The total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final`.\n    *   `J_initial = J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum `J(NN_final)` and the particle X's total angular momentum `j_X`. `j_X` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its spin `s_X`.\n    *   To conserve `J=0`, we must be able to couple `J(NN_final)` and `j_X` to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J(NN_final) = j_X`.\n    *   The relation between `j_X`, `l_X`, and `s_X` is `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n    *   The simplest assumption, common in such problems when `s_X` is not specified, is that X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion), so `s_X = 0`. In this case, `j_X = l_X`, and the conservation law simplifies to `J(NN_final) = l_X`. We will use this simplified rule.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's create a table to check each option against the three conditions.\n\n| Option | Final NN State | S | L | J | l_X | **1. S+L odd?** | **2. L+l_X odd?** | **3.

This transition is permitted.\n*   **B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**: All three conditions are satisfied. This transition is permitted.\n*   **C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**: All three conditions derived from the problem statement are satisfied. While a `S=3` state (`2S+1=7`) is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system (as each nucleon has spin 1/2, their total spin can only be 0 or 1), the transition *itself* does not violate the explicit rules of conservation and Pauli statistics we were asked to check.\n*   **D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**: This transition violates Condition 1 (Pauli statistics for the final state). The sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is even. For a `T=0` state, this sum must be odd.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe partial wave `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because the final two-nucleon state (`3P0` with `T=0`) violates the generalized Pauli principle.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\nFirst, we need to determine the properties of the initial two-nucleon (NN) state, `1S0`, and establish the rules that govern the transition.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`):** The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial state.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   It has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by `l_X` (`s=0`, `p=1`, `f=3`).\n\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   It has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nNow, we establish the three selection rules that any permitted transition `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X` must obey:\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem provides the condition `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since the final state has `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This equation is only true if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number, which means **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   `P_i = P_{NN(final)} * P_X * P_{orbital}`\n    *   The parity of the final NN state is `P_{NN(final)} = (-1)^{L_f}`. The parity of the emitted particle is `P_X = -1`. The parity of the relative orbital motion between the products is `P_{orbital} = (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   Substituting the known values: `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. For this to be true, the exponent must be even, which means **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n    *   `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   Since the initial state has `J_i = 0`, the final angular momenta `J_f` (of the NN system) and `l_X` (of particle X) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   Therefore, the condition on the magnitudes is **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\nA transition is forbidden if it violates any of these three rules.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each proposed transition against the three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. No, it is even. **This rule is violated.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Yes.\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. Yes.\nSince the transition violates the Pauli principle for the final state, it is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Yes.\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. Yes.\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. Yes.\nThis transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` implies `S_f=3`. A system of two spin-1/2 nucleons can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. Yes.\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. Yes.\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. Yes.\nThis transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and C are not permitted. However, they are forbidden for different reasons. Option C is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. Option A is forbidden because it violates one of the explicit selection rules (the Pauli statistics condition) that the problem asks you to apply to the reaction dynamics. In the context of the question, which requires using the given conservation laws and principles, option A is the intended answer as it fails a direct check of those rules.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we must check each proposed transition against three conservation laws or rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The quantum numbers of the final two-nucleon state must satisfy the given relation `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n\nLet's break down the rules based on the initial state and the reaction.\n\n**Initial State: `1S0`**\n*   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from 'S')\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`\n*   The parity of the initial NN state is `P_i(NN) = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**The Reaction: `NN_i -> NN_f + X`**\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system is `l_X`.\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n\nNow let's formulate the rules for a transition to be \"permitted\":\n\n**Rule 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`). Assuming particle X is spin-0 (like a pion), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `j_X = l_X`.\nFor the vector sum `J_f + l_X` to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n`J_f = l_X`\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`, the intrinsic parity of X `P(X) = -1`, and the orbital parity of X `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`.\n`P_i = P_f(NN) * P(X) * P_orbital(X)`\n`+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n`+1 = (-1) * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\nThis equation holds only if `L_f + l_X` is an odd number.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Statistics**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T_f(NN) = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. Since we are given `T_f(NN) = 0`, the rule becomes:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis requires `S_f + L_f` to be an odd number.\n\nLet's check each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (`J_f = l_X`): `3 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   Rule 2 (`L_f + l_X` is odd): `2 + 3 = 5`. **(OK)**\n*   Rule 3 (`S_f + L_f` is odd): `1 + 2 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   This state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system, as the total spin can only be S=0 or S=1.

This is required by the generalized Pauli principle for two nucleons, which states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, leading to the condition `L+S+T` being an odd number. For the initial state, `0+0+T` must be odd, so `T=1`.\n\n2.  **Final State**:\n    *   The final two-nucleon state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0` (given).\n    *   The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s, p, f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X, `l(X)`.\n\n3.  **Conservation Laws and Principles**:\n    *   **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state. Since `J(NN_initial) = 0`, the total angular momentum of the final products must couple to zero. Assuming the emitted particle X has no intrinsic spin (which is standard for this notation), this requires the total angular momentum of the final NN state to be equal in magnitude to the orbital angular momentum of particle X: `J(NN_final) = l(X)`.\n    *   **Conservation of Parity**: The total parity must be conserved. `P(initial) = P(final)`. This means `P(NN_initial) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l(X)`.\n        *   `+1 = ((-1)^L(NN_final)) * (-1) * ((-1)^l(X))`\n        *   This simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l(X))`, which means the sum `L(NN_final) + l(X)` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Pauli Principle for the Final State**: The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given `T(NN_final) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`, which requires the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` to be an odd number. This is consistent with the generalized Pauli principle (`L+S+T` must be odd).\n    *   **Composition of the NN System**: A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles (fermions). Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). A state with `S=3` is not possible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l=1`.\n*   Pauli (`S+L` odd?): `1+0=1` (Odd). **OK.**\n*   J-conservation (`J=l`?): `1=1`. **OK.**\n*   P-conservation (`L+l` odd?): `0+1=1` (Odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l=3`.\n*   Pauli (`S+L` odd?): `1+2=3` (Odd). **OK.**\n*   J-conservation (`J=l`?): `3=3`. **OK.**\n*   P-conservation (`L+l` odd?): `2+3=5` (Odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` implies `S=3`.\n*   A total spin of `S=3` is impossible for a system of two nucleons. Therefore, the final state `7D1` cannot exist.\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is physically impossible.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l=0`.\n*   Pauli (`S+L` odd?): `1+1=2` (Even). **VIOLATED.**\n*   J-conservation (`J=l`?): `0=0`. **OK.**\n*   P-conservation (`L+l` odd?): `1+0=1` (Odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for a `T=0` final state.\n\nBoth C and D are not permitted. However, the violation in C is due to the fundamental composition of a two-nucleon system (it cannot have S=3), making the state `7D1` non-existent. The violation in D is that the proposed final state (`3P0` with `T=0`) violates the generalized Pauli principle (`L+S+T` must be odd; `1+1+0=2` is even). A `3P0` state can only exist if `T=1`. Therefore, the transition is to a state that is forbidden by the Pauli principle under the given condition that `T(NN)=0`. Both are fundamental violations. In the context of applying the given rules, option D directly violates the explicit Pauli condition provided in the prompt (`T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine which of the proposed transitions is not permitted, we must apply the fundamental conservation laws of physics and the Pauli exclusion principle as it applies to nucleons.\n\n### Summary of a Permitted Transition's Conditions:\n\n1.  **Initial State (`1S0` NN system):**\n    *   Total Spin `S(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Parity `P(NN_initial)` = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1.

For angular momentum to be conserved, the total angular momentum of the final state must also be 0.

Since `T(NN_final) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that the sum of the final spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN system must be odd.\n    *   **Condition 3: `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be odd.**\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions.

Let's break down its properties:\n*   **Term Symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:** `1S0`\n*   **Total Spin `S`:** `2S+1 = 1` → `S(initial) = 0`\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum `L`:** The letter `S` corresponds to `L(initial) = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum `J`:** `J(initial) = 0`.\n*   **Parity `P`:** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin `T`:** The generalized Pauli principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, which implies that `L + S + T` must be an odd number. For the initial state, `0 + 0 + T = odd`, which means `T(initial) = 1`.\n\nThe final state consists of the final NN system and the emitted particle X. The process is `NN(initial) → NN(final) + X`. We must check the following conditions for each proposed transition:\n\n1.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** The problem states that the final NN state has `T(final) = 0` and must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. With `T(final) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S(final) + L(final) + 1 (mod 2)`, which simplifies to requiring that `S(final) + L(final)` must be an **odd** number.\n2.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state is `J(initial) = 0`. The total angular momentum of the final state, `J(final)`, is found by the vector addition of the final NN system's total angular momentum, `J(final NN)`, and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l(X)` (assuming X is a spin-0 particle, which is standard unless specified otherwise). For the transition to be allowed, `J(final)` must be able to equal 0. This is possible only if `J(final NN)` and `l(X)` can be combined to result in 0, which requires `J(final NN) = l(X)`.\n3.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved.\n    *   `P(initial) = +1`.\n    *   `P(final) = P(final NN) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^L(final NN) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`.\n    *   The intrinsic parity of particle X is given as `P(X) = -1`. The term `P(orbital) = (-1)^l(X)` accounts for the parity of the wavefunction of the emitted particle.\n    *   Therefore, `P(final) = -1 * (-1)^(L(final NN) + l(X))`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P(initial) = P(final)`), we need `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(final NN) + l(X))`, which means `L(final NN) + l(X)` must be an **odd** number.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state is `3P0`: `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X is in an `s`-wave: `l(X)=0`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(final) + L(final) = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the requirement that `S+L` be odd for a `T=0` state. Thus, the final state `(T=0) 3P0` is forbidden by the Pauli principle.\n2.  **Angular Momentum:** `J(final NN) = 0`, `l(X) = 0`. `J(final)` can be 0.

However, they are forbidden for different reasons. Option C describes a transition to a state (`S=3`) that is fundamentally impossible for a two-nucleon system. Option A describes a transition to a state (`3P0`) which is physically possible in principle, but is forbidden for the specified isospin `T=0` by the Pauli principle rule explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. Given that the question explicitly provides the Pauli statistics condition to be used, the violation of this rule is the intended mechanism to identify the incorrect transition. Option A is the only one that violates this specific rule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n**1.

The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the final total angular momentum to be zero, it is required that `J_f = l_X`.\n2.  **Parity Conservation**: The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P(X) = -1`), and the parity of X's orbital motion (`(-1)^l_X`). For parity to be conserved, `P_i = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`. This leads to `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`, which simplifies to the condition that the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n**Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n*   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n*   Substituting `T=0` into the rule gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires the sum `S_f + L_f` to be **odd**.\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on these three conditions:\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Angular Momentum (`J_f = l_X`?):** `1 = 1`. **OK**.\n*   **Parity (`L_f + l_X` odd?):** `0 + 1 = 1`. **OK**.\n*   **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. **OK**.\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` implies `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   This option describes a final state with total spin S=3. However, a system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. A state with S=3 is physically impossible for this system. Therefore, this transition is not permitted because the final state is non-existent.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n*   **Angular Momentum (`J_f = l_X`?):** `3 = 3`. **OK**.\n*   **Parity (`L_f + l_X` odd?):** `2 + 3 = 5`. **OK**.\n*   **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `1 + 2 = 3`. **OK**.\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n*   **Angular Momentum (`J_f = l_X`?):** `0 = 0`. **OK**.\n*   **Parity (`L_f + l_X` odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. **OK**.\n*   **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `1 + 1 = 2`. This is **even**, which violates the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for `T_f = 0`. **NOT OK**.\n*   This transition is not permitted.\n\nBoth options B and D describe forbidden transitions. However, option D is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle selection rule explicitly provided in the problem statement. Option B is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the proposed final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons. In the context of applying the given rules, option D presents a direct violation of those rules.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will deconstruct the problem to identify the key principles and quantum numbers involved. The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. It decays into a final NN state and a particle X with intrinsic parity -1.\n2.  I will establish the rules that must be satisfied for a transition to be permitted, based on the information given in the prompt:\n    *   **Pauli Statistics for the final NN state:** The prompt provides a specific rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = (S_f + L_f + 1) % 2`, which means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity before and after the decay must be the same. The initial parity is `P_i = P(NN_i) = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`. The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_x`, where `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`, `P(X) = -1` (given), and `l_x` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X. For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x`. This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_x) = -1`, meaning `L_f + l_x` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state `1S0` has total angular momentum `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f(NN)`) and the angular momentum of particle X (`j_x`). For `J_f` to be 0, `J_f(NN)` and `j_x` must be coupled to zero, which requires them to have equal magnitudes. We will assume particle X is spinless, so its total angular momentum `j_x` is just its orbital angular momentum `l_x`. Therefore, the condition is `J_f(NN) = l_x`.\n3.  Next, I will write a Python script to systematically check each of the four options (A, B, C, D) against these three rules.\n4.  For each option, the script will:\n    *   Parse the term symbols (`(2S+1)L(J)`) to extract the final spin `S_f`, final orbital angular momentum `L_f`, and final total angular momentum `J_f` for the NN state.\n    *   Determine the orbital angular momentum `l_x` of particle X from its spectroscopic letter.\n    *   Apply the three checks (Pauli, Parity, Angular Momentum).\n5.  Finally, the script will print a detailed analysis for each option, indicating whether it is permitted or not, and will output the single option that is not permitted according to these rules. The option `D) 7D1` contains a spin `S=3` (`2S+1=7`), which is impossible for a two-nucleon system. While this makes the state physically impossible, my analysis will focus on the conservation laws and rules explicitly mentioned in the prompt, as this is the standard way to approach such problems.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef solve_physics_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes nucleon decay channels to find the one that is not permitted.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Helper function to parse spectroscopic notation for angular momentum L\n    def parse_L(L_char):\n        mapping = {'S': 0, 'P': 1, 'D': 2, 'F': 3}\n        return mapping.get(L_char.upper(), -1)\n\n    # The four options for the decay channel: 1S0 -> NN_final + X\n    options = {\n        \"A\": {\"NN_final\": \"3P0\", \"X_l_char\": \"s\"},\n        \"B\": {\"NN_final\": \"3D3\", \"X_l_char\": \"f\"},\n        \"C\": {\"NN_final\": \"3S1\", \"X_l_char\": \"p\"},\n        \"D\": {\"NN_final\": \"7D1\", \"X_l_char\": \"p\"},\n    }\n\n    # Isospin of the final NN state is given as T_f = 0\n    T_f = 0\n\n    print(\"Analyzing decay channels based on the following rules:\")\n    print(\"1.

We use the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)` to extract the quantum numbers:\n*   **Spin (S_i):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0` (spin singlet).\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L_i):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J_i):** The subscript `0` gives `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P_i):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Final State and Emitted Particle\n\nThe final state consists of a new two-nucleon state (NN_f) and an emitted particle X.\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN center of mass is `l_X`, denoted by the lowercase letters (`s` for `l_X=0`, `p` for `l_X=1`, `f` for `l_X=3`).\n    *   We assume particle X has zero spin (`S_X=0`), as is typical for such problems (e.g., pion emission).\n*   **Final NN State (NN_f):**\n    *   It has an isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Its quantum numbers (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) are given by the term symbols in each option.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must obey several fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final system.\n    `J_initial = J_final_system`\n    The final system's angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN_f angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`j_X = l_X + S_X`).\n    With `J_i = 0` and assuming `S_X = 0`, the conservation law is `0 = J_f + l_X` (vector sum). This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    The total parity must be conserved.\n    `P_i = P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_relative`\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_relative = (-1)^l_X` (parity from the relative motion of X)\n    Substituting the known values:\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\n    `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`\n    This requires the sum `L_f + l_X` to be an **odd** integer.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle for Final NN State:**\n    The problem provides the specific constraint for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Since we are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`, the condition becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which implies that the sum `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Each Proposed Transition\n\nWe will now check each option against these three conditions. The transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. Yes. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Yes. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. The total spin can only be `S=0` (antiparallel spins) or `S=1` (parallel spins). A spin of `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon state. Therefore, this final state cannot exist, and the transition is not permitted. For completeness, let's check the other rules.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. Yes. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** Not permitted, because the final NN state `7D1` is unphysical.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Yes. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. **No, 2 is even.** (VIOLATION)\n*   **Conclusion:** Not permitted.\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   C is not permitted because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons.\n*   D is not permitted because it violates the selection rule derived from the Pauli principle (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\nThe question explicitly directs us to use the Pauli statistics requirement. Applying the three main selection rules (J-conservation, P-conservation, and the given Pauli rule), option D is the one that fails. While option C is also impossible, the reason for its failure is the composition of the state itself, whereas the failure in D is a direct violation of one of the transition rules we were asked to check. In the context of such questions, we test the given rules. The rule explicitly given for the final state's quantum numbers is violated by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n    *   For `1S0`: `2S+1=1` -> `S=0` (total spin). `L=S` -> `L=0` (orbital angular momentum). `J=0` (total angular momentum).\n    *   The initial parity is `P_initial = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   The initial total angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Process:** The system emits a particle `X` and transitions to a final NN state.\n    *   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The emission of `X` occurs in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f...).\n\n*   **Conservation Laws:**\n    1.  **Parity Conservation:** `P_initial = P_final`.\n    2.  **Total Angular Momentum (J) Conservation:** `J_initial = J_final`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Constraints\n\n*   **Final State:** `NN_final + X`.\n    *   The final NN state is described by `(2S'+1)L'(J')`.\n    *   The particle `X` has orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n\n*   **Applying Parity Conservation:**\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital = (-1)^L' * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L' + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   Since `P_initial = +1`, we must have `+1 = (-1)^(L' + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This implies that the exponent `L' + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   Therefore, `L' + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Applying Angular Momentum Conservation:**\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J'` and the total angular momentum of particle X, `j_X`.\n    *   So, `vec{J}_{final} = vec{J'} + vec{j_X}`. For `J_final` to be 0, we must have `vec{J'} = -vec{j_X}`, which means their magnitudes are equal: `J' = j_X`.\n    *   The total angular momentum of X is `vec{j_X} = vec{l_X} + vec{s_X}`, where `s_X` is the spin of X. The triangle inequality states `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n    *   Combining these gives the constraint `|l_X - s_X| <= J' <= l_X + s_X`.\n    *   If we assume X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion, a common scenario for a particle with `P=-1`), then `s_X=0`, and the constraint simplifies to `J' = l_X`.\n\n*   **Applying the Pauli Principle:**\n    *   The problem states a specific rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are also given the condition that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T'=0` into the rule gives `0 = S' + L' + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This requires `S' + L' + 1` to be an even number, which means `S' + L'` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Constraint on NN States:**\n    *   A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). Any other value of `S` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each proposed transition against these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_final`: `3D3` -> `S'=1, L'=2, J'=3`.\n*   `X`: f-wave -> `l_X = 3`.\n*   **NN State Validity:** `S'=1` is allowed. `|L'-S'| <= J' <= L'+S'` -> `|2-1| <= 3 <= 2+1` -> `1 <= 3 <= 3`. Valid.\n*   **Pauli (`S'+L'` odd?):** `1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Parity (`L'+l_X` odd?):** `2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **J-Cons. (`J'=l_X` for `s_X=0`):** `3 = 3`. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN_final`: `7D1` -> `2S'+1=7` -> `S'=3`. `L'=2, J'=1`.\n*   `X`: p-wave -> `l_X = 1`.\n*   **NN State Validity:** `S'=3` is **not possible** for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is not permitted because the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN_final`: `3S1` -> `S'=1, L'=0, J'=1`.\n*   `X`: p-wave -> `l_X = 1`.\n*   **NN State Validity:** `S'=1` is allowed. `|L'-S'| <= J' <= L'+S'` -> `|0-1| <= 1 <= 0+1` -> `1 <= 1 <= 1`. Valid.\n*   **Pauli (`S'+L'` odd?):** `1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Parity (`L'+l_X` odd?):** `0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **J-Cons. (`J'=l_X` for `s_X=0`):** `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN_final`: `3P0` -> `S'=1, L'=1, J'=0`.\n*   `X`: s-wave -> `l_X = 0`.\n*   **NN State Validity:** `S'=1` is allowed. `|L'-S'| <= J' <= L'+S'` -> `|1-1| <= 0 <= 1+1` -> `0 <= 0 <= 2`. Valid.\n*   **Pauli (`S'+L'` odd?):** `1+1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the Pauli principle for a `T'=0` state.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is not permitted.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **B)** is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` (`S=3`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   **D)** is forbidden because for the final NN state `3P0` (`S=1, L=1`), the sum `S'+L'` is even, which violates the given Pauli principle under the condition that `T'=0`.\n\nWhile both are forbidden, the question is structured to test the application of the explicitly provided rules, especially the Pauli statistics rule. The violation in option D is a direct contradiction of this rule under the specified conditions (`T'=0`). The violation in option B relies on implicit knowledge (spin of a nucleon) not explicitly stated in the problem prompt. In such cases, the intended answer is most likely the one that violates the explicitly given constraints. The combination of the `3P0` state with the condition `T=0` is impossible due to the Pauli principle that was provided.\n\nLet's check the other conservation laws for D to confirm the Pauli violation is the sole issue.\n*   Parity: `L'+l_X = 1+0=1` (odd). OK.\n*   J-Conservation: `J'=0, l_X=0`. This requires `s_X=0` for the angular momenta to couple to `J_final=0`. So `J'=l_X` is satisfied. OK.\n\nThe only violation for transition D is the Pauli principle.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine the quantum numbers:\n        *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  implies initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   `L` is 'S', which means initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   `J` is '0', which means initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The initial NN system emits a particle X and transitions to a final NN state.\n    *   `NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n    *   The intrinsic parity of particle X is given as `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `J_i = J_f`\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_{NN_f}`) and the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X (`l_X`).\n    *   For `vec(J_{NN_f}) + vec(l_X)` to equal 0, their magnitudes must be equal: `J_{NN_f} = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = P_f`\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P_{NN_f}`), the intrinsic parity of X (`P_X`), and the parity of the relative orbital motion (`(-1)^{l_X}`).\n    *   `P_f = P_{NN_f} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_{NN_f}} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   Setting `P_i = P_f`: `+1 = (-1)^{L_{NN_f}} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_{NN_f} + l_X} = -1`, which means the sum `L_{NN_f} + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 2. Apply the Pauli Statistics Constraint\n\n*   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting this into the rule: `0 = S_{NN_f} + L_{NN_f} + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This implies that the sum `S_{NN_f} + L_{NN_f}` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition\n\nA transition is permitted only if it satisfies all three of the following conditions:\n1.  `J_{NN_f} = l_X` (from J conservation)\n2.  `L_{NN_f} + l_X` is **odd** (from P conservation)\n3.  `S_{NN_f} + L_{NN_f}` is **odd** (from Pauli statistics for T=0)\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each of the given final states against these three conditions.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `3 = 3`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n*   *Note on the state's existence:* A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, a state with S=3 is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. This means the transition is forbidden because the final state cannot exist. However, we will proceed to check the transition rules as instructed.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓)\n*   Conclusion: This transition satisfies all the given conservation laws and rules, but is forbidden on the more fundamental ground that the final NN state is impossible.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `0 = 0`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (**X**)\n*   Conclusion: This transition violates the Pauli statistics condition for a T=0 final state. Therefore, this partial wave is **not permitted**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nWhile option (C) describes a transition to a physically impossible state, option (D) is the one that violates the specific selection rules derived from the conservation laws and the Pauli constraint provided in the problem statement. In the context of such physics problems, the goal is typically to apply these specific transition rules. The transition in option (D) is dynamically forbidden by these rules.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the conservation laws of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle as specified for the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\n1.  **Initial State (NN)**: `1S0`\n    *   Total Spin `S(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial)` = 0\n    *   Parity `P(NN_initial)` = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1\n\n2.  **Emitted Particle (X)**:\n    *   Intrinsic Parity `P(X)` = -1\n\n3.  **Final State (NN + X)**:\n    *   Final NN Isospin `T(NN_final)` = 0\n\n### Conservation Laws & Pauli Principle\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    *   `J(NN_initial)` = `J(NN_final)` + `L(X)` (vector sum)\n    *   Since `J(NN_initial)` = 0, this implies `J(NN_final)` must be equal in magnitude to the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `L(X)`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity**: The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    *   `P(initial)` = `P(NN_initial)` = +1\n    *   `P(final)` = `P(NN_final)` * `P(X)` * `P(orbital)` = `(-1)^L(NN_final)` * `(-1)` * `(-1)^L(X)`\n    *   Equating the two: `+1 = -(-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X))`\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X)) = -1`, which means the sum `L(NN_final) + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Given `T(NN_final) = 0`, the equation becomes `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This requires the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1` to be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be **odd**.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each transition against these three conditions. The notation for the final state is `(NN state) + (particle X orbital)`. The term symbol for the NN state is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): S=1, L=0, J=1.\n*   Particle X (`p`): L(X)=1.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J(NN_final)` = 1 and `L(X)` = 1. Condition `J(NN_final) = L(X)` is met. **(Allowed)**\n2.  **Parity**: `L(NN_final) + L(X)` = 0 + 1 = 1 (odd). **(Allowed)**\n3.  **Pauli**: `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` = 1 + 0 = 1 (odd). **(Allowed)**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): This term symbol implies `2S+1 = 7`, which means `S=3`. A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. A total spin of S=3 is not possible.\nTherefore, this final state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system, and the transition is not permitted. While one could check the other conservation rules, the impossibility of the final state is the most fundamental reason for it being forbidden.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): S=1, L=2, J=3.\n*   Particle X (`f`): L(X)=3.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J(NN_final)` = 3 and `L(X)` = 3. Condition `J(NN_final) = L(X)` is met. **(Allowed)**\n2.  **Parity**: `L(NN_final) + L(X)` = 2 + 3 = 5 (odd). **(Allowed)**\n3.  **Pauli**: `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` = 1 + 2 = 3 (odd). **(Allowed)**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): S=1, L=1, J=0.\n*   Particle X (`s`): L(X)=0.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J(NN_final)` = 0 and `L(X)` = 0. Condition `J(NN_final) = L(X)` is met. **(Allowed)**\n2.  **Parity**: `L(NN_final) + L(X)` = 1 + 0 = 1 (odd). **(Allowed)**\n3.  **Pauli**: `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` = 1 + 1 = 2 (even). This **violates** the condition that `S+L` must be odd. **(Not Permitted)**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have identified two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **B)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **D)** is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule given in the problem for a final state with T=0.\n\nIn the context of problems involving selection rules, it is common to test the application of those specific rules on states that are otherwise assumed to be plausible. Option D is ruled out directly by one of the stated conditions to be checked (the Pauli rule). The issue with Option B is more fundamental, concerning the composition of the state itself rather than the transition dynamics. It is highly probable that Option D is the intended answer, as it fails a direct application of the provided selection rules.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers:\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S(i) + 1 = 1`  implies the total spin `S(i) = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` implies the orbital angular momentum `L(i) = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` implies the total angular momentum `J(i) = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is `P(i) = (-1)^L(i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   According to the generalized Pauli principle for two nucleons, the sum `L + S + T` must be odd. For the initial state, `0 + 0 + T(i)` must be odd, which means the isospin `T(i) = 1`.\n\n### 2. Final State and Particle X Analysis\n\nThe system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T(f) = 0`.\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The orbital angular momentum of particle X relative to the NN system is denoted by a lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, f=3). This contributes `(-1)^L(X)` to the final state's parity.\n\n### 3. Conservation Laws and Selection Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for the transition to be permitted:\n\n**Rule 1: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n`P(i) = P(f) = P(final NN) * P(X) * P(relative motion)`\n`+1 = (-1)^L(f) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`\n`+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(f) + L(X))`\n`-1 = (-1)^(L(f) + L(X))`\nThis implies that the sum **`L(f) + L(X)` must be odd**.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the vector sum of the angular momenta of the final products. Assuming the emitted particle X has zero spin (a common convention for partial wave analysis unless specified otherwise), the conservation law is:\n`J(i) = J(f) + L(X)` (vector sum)\nSince `J(i) = 0`, the equation becomes `0 = J(f) + L(X)`. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal: **`J(f) = L(X)`**.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Principle for the Final State**\nThe problem explicitly states that for the final NN state, `T(f) = S(f) + L(f) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nGiven that `T(f) = 0`, the condition becomes:\n`0 = S(f) + L(f) + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis requires that **`S(f) + L(f)` must be odd**.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S(f) = 1`, `L(f) = 1`, `J(f) = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `L(X) = 0`.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L(f) + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd).  -> **OK**\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** `J(f) = 0` and `L(X) = 0`. `J(f) = L(X)`. -> **OK**\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S(f) + L(f) = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). -> **FAIL**\n\nThis transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S(f) = 1`, `L(f) = 2`, `J(f) = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `L(X) = 3`.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L(f) + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** `J(f) = 3` and `L(X) = 3`. `J(f) = L(X)`. -> **OK**\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S(f) + L(f) = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S(f) = 1`, `L(f) = 0`, `J(f) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `L(X) = 1`.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L(f) + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** `J(f) = 1` and `L(X) = 1`. `J(f) = L(X)`. -> **OK**\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S(f) + L(f) = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S(f)+1=7` implies `S(f) = 3`. However, a two-nucleon system (composed of two spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Thus, the state `7D1` is not a possible state for a two-nucleon system. While this makes the transition impossible, we can still check it against the given rules for completeness.\n*   `S(f) = 3`, `L(f) = 2`, `J(f) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `L(X) = 1`.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L(f) + L(X) = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** `J(f) = 1` and `L(X) = 1`. `J(f) = L(X)`. -> **OK**\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S(f) + L(f) = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\nThis transition is forbidden because the final state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. However, option A is forbidden by a direct violation of the selection rules explicitly mentioned in the problem description to be used. In physics problems of this type, the answer is the one that violates the given conservation laws or selection rules.\n\nConclusion: Option A is the only one that violates the selection rules provided in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Define the System and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State (NN_i):** A two-nucleon system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1`  => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The initial system emits a particle X: `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Particle X is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` relative to the final NN system. The spectroscopic notation for `l_X` is given by the lowercase letter (`s` for `l_X=0`, `p` for `l_X=1`, `f` for `l_X=3`).\n\n*   **Final State (NN_f + X):**\n    *   The final two-nucleon state `NN_f` has isospin `T_f = 0`. Its other quantum numbers (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) are given by its term symbol.\n    *   The total final state is the combination of `NN_f` and particle `X`.\n\nWe need to check three conditions for each proposed reaction:\n1.  **Conservation of Parity:** `P_i = P_f`.\n2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** `J_i = J_f`.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** For the final `NN` state, the given rule must hold: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Rules for this Specific Problem\n\n1.  **Parity Rule:**\n    *   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`, where `P_orbital` is the parity of the relative motion between `NN_f` and `X`.\n    *   `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   Since `P_i = +1`, we must have `P_f = +1`.\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`. This means the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n2.  **Angular Momentum Rule:**\n    *   The total final angular momentum `J_f_total` is the vector sum of the `NN_f` angular momentum `J_f` and the particle `X`'s orbital angular momentum `l_X` (we assume X is spinless).\n    *   `J_f_total = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   For `J_f_total` to equal `J_i = 0`, the vectors `J_f` and `l_X` must be able to sum to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal.\n    *   Therefore, **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Rule:**\n    *   We are given `T_f = 0`. The rule is `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T_f=0`: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n    *   Therefore, **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n### 3. Test Each Option\n\nNow we apply these three rules to each option. A transition is forbidden if it violates any one of these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN_f` state is `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle `X` state is `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **This violates the rule** that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   **Parity Rule:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). This is okay.\n*   **Angular Momentum Rule:** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. This is okay.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** due to the violation of the Pauli principle.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` state is `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle `X` state is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). Okay.\n*   **Parity Rule:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). Okay.\n*   **Angular Momentum Rule:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. Okay.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   The `NN_f` state is `7D1`. The multiplicity `2S_f+1 = 7` implies `S_f = 3`. A system of two spin-1/2 nucleons can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). `S=3` is impossible. Therefore, the final `NN` state is unphysical, and the transition is not permitted. It is highly likely this is a typo for `3D1`. If we assume it is `3D1`, the transition is permitted (as shown in the thought process). In either interpretation, there is a reason this option could be seen as \"not permitted\", but option A violates the specific rule given in the prompt.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_f` state is `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle `X` state is `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). Okay.\n*   **Parity Rule:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). Okay.\n*   **Angular Momentum Rule:** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. Okay.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe transition in option A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`) is the only one that violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly provided in the question for a final state with `T(NN)=0`. The other transitions (assuming `7D1` is a typo for `3D1`) satisfy all the required conservation laws and statistical rules.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` corresponds to an orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` is the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe problem states that the reaction `NN_initial -> NN_final + X` must satisfy several conditions.\n\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. We will denote its orbital angular momentum by `l_X`. The problem does not specify the spin of X (`s_X`). A common assumption for such problems is that X is a spin-0 meson (like a pion), so its total angular momentum is `J_X = l_X`. We will proceed with this assumption.\n*   **Final NN State:** Has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must check three rules for each potential transition:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f_NN`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`J_X`). For `J_f` to be 0, `J_f_NN` and `J_X` must be coupled to zero. This is only possible if `J_f_NN = J_X`. Assuming `s_X = 0`, this simplifies to `J_f_NN = l_X`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the parity of X's orbital motion.\n    *   `P_f_NN = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`\n    *   So, `P_f = P_f_NN * P(X) * P_orbital(X) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `P_i = P_f`, so `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`. This implies that the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Pauli Principle for Final NN State:** The problem gives the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final state has `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation requires `S_f + L_f` to be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f_NN=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Allowed**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f_NN=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 0` and `l_X = 0`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Not Permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2` (D state). `J_f_NN=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Fundamental Issue:** A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. The total spin can only be `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet state) or `S = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0` (singlet state). It is impossible for two nucleons to form a spin `S=3` state. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. This transition is forbidden on these grounds.\n*   However, if we strictly and mechanically apply *only the rules listed in the prompt*, we get:\n    1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n    2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n    3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   This creates an ambiguity. The state is impossible, but it passes the test of the explicit rules given. In multiple-choice questions, we should look for the most direct violation of the given constraints. The violation in option B is a direct failure to meet the Pauli statistics rule as stated in the prompt. The issue with C is more fundamental but relies on knowledge not explicitly listed in the constraints to be checked. Therefore, B is the most likely intended answer.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f_NN=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 3` and `l_X = 3`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Allowed**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the options, transition B is the only one that violates the explicitly stated Pauli principle for a final state with `T=0`. While transition C describes an unphysical final state, it formally satisfies the rules given in the prompt. The question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave using the given conservation laws and statistics. Option B fails this test directly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial NN (two-nucleon) state:** The system starts in a `1S0` state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial state:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S = 0`.\n    *   The spectroscopic letter `S` implies the total orbital angular momentum is `L = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` implies the total angular momentum is `J = 0`.\n*   **Initial Parity:** The parity of a two-particle system is given by `P = P1 * P2 * (-1)^L`, where `P1` and `P2` are the intrinsic parities of the particles. Nucleons have an intrinsic parity of `+1`.\n    *   `P_initial = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Emitted Particle X:**\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`, etc.), which we'll call `l_X`.\n*   **Final NN state:**\n    *   It is described by the term symbol `(2S'+1)L'(J')`.\n    *   We are given that its isospin is `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Selection Rules to Be Applied\n\nThe problem states we must use three key principles:\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics (as specified):** The problem gives a specific form of the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state: `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN)` must be an odd number. Since we are given `T(NN) = 0`, this simplifies to:\n    *   **Rule 1: `S' + L'` must be odd.**\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the system must be the same before and after the emission.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   `P_final = P(final NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`\n    *   `P(final NN) = (-1)^L'`\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^L' * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L' + l_X + 1)`\n    *   For this to be true, the exponent `L' + l_X + 1` must be even. This implies:\n    *   **Rule 2: `L' + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial = J_final`\n    *   From the initial `1S0` state, we have `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J'`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n    *   The simplest assumption, common in such problems unless specified otherwise, is that the emitted particle X is spinless (`s_X = 0`). In this case, `j_X = l_X`.\n    *   The conservation law becomes `vec(J_initial) = vec(J') + vec(l_X)`.\n    *   `vec(0) = vec(J') + vec(l_X)`. This can only be true if the vectors have equal magnitude and opposite direction. Thus:\n    *   **Rule 3: `J' = l_X`** (assuming `s_X = 0`).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Proposed Transition\n\nWe will now test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S'=1`, `L'=1`, `J'=0`.\n*   Particle X state (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S' + L'` odd?):** `1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **This violates Rule 1.**\n2.  Parity Check (`L' + l_X` odd?): `1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  J-Conservation Check (`J' = l_X`?): `0 = 0`. This is satisfied.\nSince the transition violates the Pauli principle, it is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S'=1`, `L'=2`, `J'=3`.\n*   Particle X state (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S' + L'` odd?):** `1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n2.  **Parity Check (`L' + l_X` odd?):** `2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **J-Conservation Check (`J' = l_X`?):** `3 = 3`. This is satisfied.\nThis transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S'=1`, `L'=0`, `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S' + L'` odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n2.  **Parity Check (`L' + l_X` odd?):** `0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **J-Conservation Check (`J' = l_X`?):** `1 = 1`. This is satisfied.\nThis transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S'+1=7` => `S'=3`. `L'=2`, `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S' + L'` odd?):** `3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n2.  **Parity Check (`L' + l_X` odd?):** `2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **J-Conservation Check (`J' = l_X`?):** `1 = 1`. This is satisfied.\nThis transition appears permitted by the three rules. However, there is a fundamental issue: a system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S'=0` or `S'=1`. A state with `S'=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. This violates the principles of angular momentum addition. While this makes the transition forbidden, it's forbidden because the final state cannot exist, not because it violates the transition selection rules given.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, option A is the only one that directly violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem statement (`S' + L'` must be odd). The other transitions satisfy this rule. While option D describes a physically impossible final state, it does not violate the explicit selection rules for the process itself in the same way that option A does. In the context of applying the given rules, A is the unambiguously forbidden transition.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each proposed transition against three constraints:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem states that for a final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the total spin `S_f` and orbital angular momentum `L_f` must satisfy `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The initial state `1S0` has a total angular momentum `J_i = 0`. The final state consists of the final NN system with total angular momentum `J_f` and the particle X with orbital angular momentum `l_X`. To conserve total angular momentum, the vector sum `J_f + l_X` must equal `J_i = 0`. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal, so `J_f = l_X`.\n3.  **Conservation of Parity:**\n    *   The parity of the initial `1S0` state is `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   The parity of the final state is the product of the final NN state's parity `P_f(NN) = (-1)^{L_f}` and the parity of the emitted particle X system.\n    *   The parity of the X system is its intrinsic parity (`-1`) multiplied by its orbital parity `(-1)^{l_X}`, which gives `P(X_system) = (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{l_X+1}`.\n    *   Therefore, the total final parity is `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X_system) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X+1} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `(-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1} = +1`. This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\nLet's examine each option based on these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   Rule 1 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 2 (Ang.

This leads to the condition that the sum of orbital angular momentum (L), spin (S), and isospin (T) must be an odd number (`L+S+T = odd`). For the initial `1S0` state (`L=0, S=0`), the isospin must be `T(i) = 1`.\n\n2.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem states the final two-nucleon (NN) state has isospin `T(NN,f) = 0`.\n    *   The Pauli principle for this final state (`L(f) + S(f) + T(f) = odd`) requires that `L(f) + S(f)` must be odd.\n    *   The prompt provides this condition in the form `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`, which for `T(NN)=0` also implies `S(f) + L(f)` must be odd.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   The total angular momentum must be conserved, so `J(i) = J(f)`.\n    *   Since `J(i) = 0`, the total angular momentum of the final products must also be zero.

While this makes the transition forbidden, it may be a typographical error. If we check the other rules, we find they are satisfied (assuming the state could exist). However, the violation in option A is of a rule explicitly stated in the problem.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S(f)=1`, `L(f)=0`, `J(f)=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l(X)=1`.\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S(f) + L(f) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd).

Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final NN State\n\nThe generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a system of two identical fermions like nucleons requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric upon particle exchange. This leads to a specific condition relating the total orbital angular momentum (L), total spin (S), and total isospin (T) of the two-nucleon (NN) system. The relationship is that the sum `L + S + T` must be an odd integer.\n\nThe problem states that the final NN state has an isospin `T(NN) = 0`. Plugging this into the Pauli principle (`L + S + T = odd`) gives the condition that for the final state, `L(NN) + S(NN)` must be **odd**.\n\nLet's examine the NN state for each option:\n*   **A) 7D1:** The term symbol (2S+1)L(J) tells us L=2 (a D-state) and 2S+1=7, so S=3. The sum `L+S = 2+3 = 5`, which is **odd**. This state is allowed by the Pauli principle for T=0.\n*   **B) 3D3:** Here, L=2 and 2S+1=3, so S=1. The sum `L+S = 2+1 = 3`, which is **odd**. This state is also allowed for T=0.\n*   **C) 3S1:** Here, L=0 (an S-state) and 2S+1=3, so S=1. The sum `L+S = 0+1 = 1`, which is **odd**. This state is allowed for T=0.\n*   **D) 3P0:** Here, L=1 (a P-state) and 2S+1=3, so S=1. The sum `L+S = 1+1 = 2`, which is **even**.\n\nSince `L+S` is even for the `3P0` state, it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system with isospin T=0. Therefore, this state cannot exist, and no reaction can produce it. This alone is sufficient to identify option D as the forbidden transition.\n\nFor completeness, we will also check the other conservation laws.\n\n### 2. Conservation of Parity\n\nParity must be conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions. The parity of a system is given by `P = P_intrinsic * (-1)^L`, where L is the orbital angular momentum.\n*   **Initial State (1S0):** The initial NN state has `L_i = 0`. Its parity is `P_i = (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Final State (NN_f + X):** The final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`.\n    *   The intrinsic parity of particle X is given as `P(X) = -1`.\n*   **Parity Conservation (`P_i = P_f`):**\n    `+1 = ((-1)^L_f) * (-1) * ((-1)^l_X)`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\nLet's check this for all options:\n*   **A) 7D1 + p:** `L_f=2`, `l_X=1`. `L_f + l_X = 2+1 = 3` (odd). **Allowed.**\n*   **B) 3D3 + f:** `L_f=2`, `l_X=3`. `L_f + l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **Allowed.**\n*   **C) 3S1 + p:** `L_f=0`, `l_X=1`. `L_f + l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **Allowed.**\n*   **D) 3P0 + s:** `L_f=1`, `l_X=0`. `L_f + l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **Allowed.**\n\nParity conservation does not forbid option D.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Angular Momentum\n\nTotal angular momentum must be conserved in any decay process.\n*   **Initial State (1S0):** The total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Final State (NN_f + X):** The total final angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the NN state's total angular momentum `J_f(NN)` and the angular momentum of particle X. The angular momentum of X is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `S_X`.\n*   **Conservation (`J_i = J_f`):** `0 = J_f(NN) + l_X + S_X` (vector sum). This means the three angular momentum vectors must be able to form a closed triangle.\n\nAssuming the simplest case where particle X has no spin (`S_X=0`), the condition becomes `J_f(NN) = l_X`.\n*   **A) 7D1 + p:** `J_f(NN)=1`, `l_X=1`. `1=1`. **Allowed.**\n*   **B) 3D3 + f:** `J_f(NN)=3`, `l_X=3`. `3=3`. **Allowed.**\n*   **C) 3S1 + p:** `J_f(NN)=1`, `l_X=1`. `1=1`. **Allowed.**\n*   **D) 3P0 + s:** `J_f(NN)=0`, `l_X=0`. `0=0`. **Allowed.**\n\nUnder the assumption of a spinless particle X, angular momentum conservation does not forbid option D. However, the violation of the Pauli exclusion principle is definitive.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because the final nucleon-nucleon state, `3P0` with `T=0`, is forbidden by the generalized Pauli exclusion principle. The sum of its orbital angular momentum (`L=1`) and spin (`S=1`) is even, whereas for an isospin `T=0` state, this sum must be odd.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the fundamental conservation laws of physics and the specific conditions given in the problem.\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\n1.  **Initial State (`1S0` NN system):**\n    *   Total Spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`\n    *   Parity `P(initial) = (-1)^L(NN_initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`\n\n2.  **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   We assume the spin of particle X is zero, as is common for emitted mesons in such problems. The lowercase letter (s, p, f) denotes its orbital angular momentum, `l(X)`.\n\n3.  **Final State (NN_final + X):**\n    *   The final two-nucleon state has Isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n\n4.  **Selection Rules:**\n    *   **Pauli Principle:** The prompt provides the condition derived from the Pauli principle for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T(NN) = 0`, this simplifies to `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity must be conserved. `P(initial) = P(final)`.\n        `P(NN_initial) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital)`\n        `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`\n        This requires that `L(NN_final) + l(X)` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. `J(initial) = J(final)`.\n        `J(NN_initial) = J(NN_final) + l(X)` (vector sum).\n        Since `J(NN_initial) = 0`, the final angular momenta must sum to zero, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN_final) = l(X)`.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\nWe will test each option against these three selection rules. The transition is not permitted if it fails even one rule.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l(X)=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `3 = 3`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l(X)=0`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). **FAILS.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `0 = 0`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final T=0 state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l(X)=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l(X)=1`.\n*   A state with total spin S=3 is not possible for a two-nucleon system, as each nucleon has spin 1/2, so the total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. Therefore, this final state cannot exist. However, the question asks to evaluate the permission of the partial wave based on the provided conservation laws. Applying the rules mechanically:\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 3+2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l(X) = 2+1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J = l(X)` -> `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   While the state itself is impossible, the transition *formally satisfies* all the selection rules given in the prompt. The most direct violation of the rules explicitly provided for the transition dynamics is in option B.\n\nBased on the violation of the Pauli principle as specified in the problem, option B is the partial wave that is not permitted.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial system is a bound two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n- The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n- **Spin `S_i`**: `2S_i + 1 = 1` gives `S_i = 0`.\n- **Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i`**: The 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n- **Total Angular Momentum `J_i`**: The subscript is `0`, so `J_i = 0`.\n- **Parity `P_i`**: The parity of an NN system is given by `(-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n- **Isospin `T_i`**: The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a system of two identical fermions (nucleons) requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric upon exchange of the particles. This leads to the condition `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, meaning `L+S+T` must be an odd number.\n- For the initial `1S0` state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. Thus, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which implies `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `J_i=0`, `P_i=+1`, `T_i=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Emitted Particle\n\nThe system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n`NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n\n- **Particle X**:\n    - Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    - Orbital angular momentum `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f for `l_X`=0, 1, 2, 3 respectively).\n    - Let the unknown spin of X be `s_X`.\n- **Final NN state**:\n    - Term symbol is `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    - Spin `S_f`, orbital angular momentum `L_f`, total angular momentum `J_f`.\n    - Parity `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`.\n    - We are given that the isospin is `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe need to check three main conditions for each proposed transition.\n\n**Constraint 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem explicitly states that the final NN state must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `T_f + S_f + L_f` being an odd integer.\nGiven `T_f = 0`, this constraint simplifies to: **`S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n\n**Constraint 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity must be conserved: `P_i = P_f`.\n`P_i` is the parity of the initial NN state, which is `+1`.\n`P_f` is the parity of the final system (NN_f + X), which is `P_f(NN) * P(X) = P_f(NN) * P_X * (-1)^l_X`.\n- `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`.\n- `P_X = -1`.\nSo, `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\nThis implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means: **`L_f + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n**Constraint 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved: `vec{J}_i = vec{J}_f_total`.\n`J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum `vec{J}_f_total = vec{J}_f + vec{j}_X`, where `vec{j}_X = vec{l}_X + vec{s}_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X.\nConservation requires `vec{J}_f + vec{j}_X = 0`, which means `J_f = j_X`.\nThe triangle inequality for angular momentum coupling (`vec{l}_X + vec{s}_X = vec{j}_X`) gives `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\nSubstituting `J_f = j_X`, we get: **`|l_X - s_X| <= J_f <= l_X + s_X`**. This must be possible for some non-negative spin `s_X`. A simple case often assumed is `s_X = 0` (e.g., for a pion), which simplifies this to `J_f = l_X`.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each option against these three constraints.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\nThe final state `7D1` implies `2S_f+1 = 7`, or `S_f=3`. A two-nucleon system is made of two spin-1/2 particles, so the total spin can only be `S=0` or `S=1`. `S=3` is impossible. This transition is forbidden because the final NN state is not physically possible.\n*Note: This is very likely a typo for `3D1`. If we assume it is `3D1` (`S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=1`) and `l_X=1` (for `p`):\n1. `S_f+L_f = 1+2 = 3` (odd) -> OK.\n2. `L_f+l_X = 2+1 = 3` (odd) -> OK.\n3. `J_f=l_X` (for `s_X=0`) is `1=1` -> OK. So if this is a typo, the transition is allowed.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n- Final NN state: `3P0` -> `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n- Particle X: `s`-wave -> `l_X=0`.\nLet's check the constraints:\n1. **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the Pauli constraint that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for `T_f = 0`.\nThis transition is forbidden.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n- Final NN state: `3S1` -> `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n- Particle X: `p`-wave -> `l_X=1`.\n1. **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). -> OK.\n2. **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). -> OK.\n3. **Ang. Mom.:** If `s_X=0`, `J_f = l_X` -> `1 = 1`. -> OK.\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n- Final NN state: `3D3` -> `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n- Particle X: `f`-wave -> `l_X=3`.\n1. **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). -> OK.\n2. **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). -> OK.\n3. **Ang. Mom.:** If `s_X=0`, `J_f = l_X` -> `3 = 3`. -> OK.\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` (Option B) is forbidden because the final two-nucleon state `3P0` with `T=0` violates the generalized Pauli principle (`S_f + L_f` is even, not odd). This rule was explicitly provided in the problem statement. While option A is also forbidden as written (`7D1` is not a valid NN state), the violation in option B is directly related to the specific Pauli statistics rule that the question instructs us to use.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo determine which of the proposed reactions is not permitted, we must check each one against the fundamental conservation laws of physics: conservation of angular momentum, conservation of parity, and the Pauli exclusion principle for the two-nucleon system.\n\n### **1. Initial State and Conservation Rules**\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`)**: The two-nucleon (NN) system starts in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can deduce its quantum numbers:\n    *   Total Spin `S = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L = 0` (from the letter 'S')\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J = 0`\n*   **Parity**: The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Particle X**: The emitted particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`. The lowercase letter in each option (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X (`L_X`) relative to the final NN system.\n*   **Final State (`T(NN)=0`)**: The final NN system has an isospin of `T=0`.\n\nWe will use the following three rules to test each reaction:\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of the final state must equal the initial state's total angular momentum (`J_initial = 0`). The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_NN`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`L_X`). For them to sum to zero, their magnitudes must be equal: `J_NN = L_X`.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity**: The total parity must be the same before and after the reaction.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   `P(NN_initial) = P(NN_final) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^L_NN * (-1) * (-1)^L_X`\n    *   This simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L_NN + L_X)`, which means the sum `L_NN + L_X` must be **odd**.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: The problem provides a specific formulation for the final state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, the rule becomes `0 = S_NN + L_NN + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires the sum `S_NN + L_NN` to be **odd**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's check each proposed reaction against these three rules.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN State (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L_X=3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation**: `J_NN=3` and `L_X=3`.

Rule is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation**: `L_NN + L_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle**: `S_NN + L_NN = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n*Conclusion*: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN State (`7D1`): `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L_X=1`.\n*   A crucial point here is that two nucleons, being spin-1/2 particles, can only combine to form a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). A total spin of `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, the final state `7D1` cannot exist.\n*Conclusion*: This transition is **not permitted** because the final NN state is physically impossible.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN State (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L_X=0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation**: `J_NN=0` and `L_X=0`. Rule is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation**: `L_NN + L_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle**: `S_NN + L_NN = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S+L` must be odd for a `T=0` state.\n*Conclusion*: This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n### **3. Final Decision**\n\nBoth reactions C and D are forbidden. However, they are forbidden for different reasons.\n*   Reaction (D) is forbidden because it directly violates the Pauli principle as stated in the problem's conditions. All conservation laws are met, but the quantum numbers of the final state are inconsistent with the Pauli principle for a T=0 state.\n*   Reaction (C) is forbidden on more fundamental grounds: the final `7D1` state is not a possible state for a two-nucleon system, as a spin of S=3 cannot be formed.\n\nWithin the context of this type of physics problem, one is expected to apply the specific rules given. Reaction (D) fails one of the explicitly provided rules (the Pauli statistics equation), while reaction (C) technically satisfies all the given rules, but describes a transition to a non-existent state. The violation in (D) is a direct failure of the problem's specific constraints.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the forbidden transition:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State (NN):** `1S0`. This term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us:\n        *   Spin `S_i = 0`\n        *   Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`\n        *   Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`\n        *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   **Final State (NN + X):** This consists of a new two-nucleon state `NN_f` and an emitted particle `X`.\n        *   `NN_f` is described by the term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n        *   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1` (given).\n        *   The orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to the `NN_f` system is `l_f` (given by the lowercase letter: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws and Principles:** A transition is only permitted if it obeys all relevant physical laws. We must check the following for each option:\n    *   **Possibility of the NN State:** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles (proton, neutron). Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state requiring another value of `S` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem gives the rule for the final two-nucleon state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are told to assume the final state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`. The rule thus becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. Any final `NN_f` state where `S_f + L_f` is even is forbidden.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n        *   `P_initial = P_final`\n        *   `P_i = +1`\n        *   `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_orbital) * P(X_intrinsic) = (-1)^L_f * (-1)^l_f * (-1)`\n        *   So, we must have `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_f + 1)`. This means the exponent `L_f + l_f + 1` must be even, which implies `L_f + l_f` must be **odd**.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved (`J_i = J_f`). Since `J_i = 0`, the total angular momentum of the final state must be 0. The final angular momentum is a vector sum of the `NN_f` total angular momentum `J_f` and the angular momentum of particle X (its orbital `l_f` and spin `s_X`). It is always possible to find a suitable spin `s_X` to make this conservation work as long as the other rules are satisfied, so this rule is less restrictive than the others for this problem.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Option:** We will apply these checks sequentially. A failure at any step means the transition is not permitted. The most fundamental check is whether the state can exist at all.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_transition(option, name, s_nn, l_nn_char, l_x_char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a nuclear transition based on physical principles.\n    Prints the step-by-step analysis.\n    Returns \"Permitted\" or \"Forbidden\".\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing Option {option}: {name} ---\")\n\n    # Map character notation to integer quantum numbers\n    L_MAP = {'S': 0, 'P': 1, 'D': 2, 'F': 3}\n    l_map = {'s': 0, 'p': 1, 'd': 2, 'f': 3}\n    l_nn = L_MAP[l_nn_char]\n    l_x = l_map[l_x_char]\n\n    # 1.

We use the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)` to extract the quantum numbers.\n-   **Spin (S)**: `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the initial total spin `S_i = 0`.\n-   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L)**: The spectroscopic symbol `S` corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n-   **Total Angular Momentum (J)**: The subscript `0` gives the initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n-   **Parity (Π)**: The parity of an NN system is given by `Π = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `Π_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n-   **Isospin (T)**: The Pauli exclusion principle for nucleons states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that `L + S + T` must be an odd number. For the initial state, `L_i + S_i + T_i = 0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This requires the initial isospin to be `T_i = 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Final State and Applicable Rules\nThe initial system emits a particle `X` and transitions to a final NN state.\n-   **Final NN State**: Described by quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f`. The problem specifies that the final isospin is `T(NN) = T_f = 0`.\n-   **Particle X**: Has intrinsic parity `Π(X) = -1` and is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` (where `s`, `p`, `d`, `f` correspond to `l_X` = 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively).\n-   **Pauli Principle for Final State**: The question provides the relation `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `T+S+L` being odd. Given `T_f = 0`, the condition becomes `0 + S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n    -   **Rule 1: `S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n\n### Step 3: Apply Conservation Laws\nThe transition from the initial to the final state must conserve total parity and total angular momentum.\n\n-   **Parity Conservation**: The initial parity must equal the final total parity.\n    -   `Π_i = +1`.\n    -   The final parity `Π_f` is the product of the final NN parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the orbital parity of X: `Π_f = Π_f(NN) * Π(X) * Π_orbital(X) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X)`.\n    -   Setting `Π_i = Π_f`: `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    -   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`.\n    -   **Rule 2: `L_f + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n-   **Total Angular Momentum Conservation**: The initial total angular momentum must equal the final total angular momentum.\n    -   `J_i = 0`.\n    -   The final total angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the angular momentum of particle X. Assuming particle X is a spin-0 boson (like a pion), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`. This is a standard assumption in such problems unless otherwise specified.\n    -   Therefore, `J_final` is the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X`. For this sum to be zero (`J_final = J_i = 0`), the magnitudes must be equal.\n    -   **Rule 3: `J_f = l_X`**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Each Option\nWe now apply these three rules to each of the proposed final states.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n-   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2` (D-state). `J_f=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n-   *Note*: `S_f=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only couple to a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Thus, this state cannot be formed. However, checking against the derived rules:\n    -   Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` odd?): `3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **Passes.**\n    -   Rule 2 (`L_f + l_X` odd?): `2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **Passes.**\n    -   Rule 3 (`J_f = l_X`?): `1 = 1`. **Passes.**\n    -   The transition is forbidden because the final state is impossible, not because it violates the transition rules.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n-   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`. `L_f=0`. `J_f=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n-   Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` odd?): `1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **Passes.**\n-   Rule 2 (`L_f + l_X` odd?): `0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **Passes.**\n-   Rule 3 (`J_f = l_X`?): `1 = 1`. **Passes.**\n-   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n-   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`. `L_f=1`. `J_f=0`.\n-   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X = 0`.\n-   Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` odd?): `1 + 1 = 2` (even). **FAILS.**\n-   The transition violates the Pauli principle for the final T=0 state. We can stop here.\n-   This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n-   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`. `L_f=2`. `J_f=3`.\n-   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X = 3`.\n-   Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` odd?): `1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **Passes.**\n-   Rule 2 (`L_f + l_X` odd?): `2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **Passes.**\n-   Rule 3 (`J_f = l_X`?): `3 = 3`. **Passes.**\n-   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle requirement that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a final NN state with `T_f = 0`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe problem asks us to identify which of the four given decay processes is not permitted. The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state, which emits a particle `X` with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state is specified to have isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n\nWe must check each option against three constraints:\n1.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which simplifies to `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    *   Initial Parity (`P_i`): The state is `1S0`, so the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`. Parity is `(-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   Final Parity (`P_f`): This is the product of the final NN state's parity, the intrinsic parity of particle `X`, and the parity from the orbital motion of `X`. `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   For `P_i = P_f`, we must have `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`. This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n3.  **Total Angular Momentum (J) Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   Initial `J`: The state is `1S0`, so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   Final `J`: This is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the angular momentum of particle `X`. Assuming particle `X` is spinless (like a pion), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`. So, `J_{total, f} = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   Conservation requires `J_i = J_{total, f}`. Since `J_i=0`, `J_f` and `l_X` must be equal in magnitude. `J_f = l_X`.\n\nLet's evaluate each option using these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle `X` in `p` state: `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n    This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle `X` in `f` state: `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n    This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle `X` in `s` state: `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f = 0` state.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n    Because this transition violates the Pauli principle condition, it is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f + 1 = 7` implies `S_f = 3`. `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle `X` in `p` state: `l_X = 1`.\nThis option has a fundamental problem: a system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S = 0` (singlet) or `S = 1` (triplet). A state with `S = 3` (`2S+1=7`) is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this decay is not permitted because the final state cannot exist.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth C and D describe non-permitted processes. However, C is forbidden because it violates one of the explicit selection rules given in the problem (the Pauli statistics rule). D is forbidden because the final state is unphysical, a fact that is external to the listed selection rules. In the context of this question, we are expected to apply the given rules to find the contradiction. Option C is the only one that fails the check based on the explicitly stated rules of the transition process.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   **Term Symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:** `1S0`\n*   **Total Spin `S(NN_initial)`:** `2S+1 = 1` → `S = 0`\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial)`:** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial)`:** The subscript '0' gives `J = 0`.\n*   **Parity `P(initial)`:** The parity of the NN system is given by `(-1)^L`. Here, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe initial system decays into a final NN state and a particle X: `1S0 -> (NN)_final + X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. We will assume particle X has spin `S(X) = 0`, as is common for emitted particles like pions in such problems. The lowercase letter (`s, p, f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X, `L(X)`.\n*   **Final State Parity:** The total parity of the final state is `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^L(X)`. Since `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)` and `P(X)=-1`, this becomes `P(final) = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`.\n\nWe must check three conservation/selection rules:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J=0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J(NN_final)`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`J(X)`). Since we assume `S(X)=0`, `J(X) = L(X)`. For the total to be zero, we must have `J(NN_final) = L(X)`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The initial parity must equal the final parity.\n    `P(initial) = P(final)`\n    `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X) + 1)`\n    This requires the exponent `L(NN_final) + L(X) + 1` to be an even number, which means **`L(NN_final) + L(X)` must be an odd number.**\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given that the final isospin is `T(NN) = 0`, we have:\n    `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that **`S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an odd number.**\n\n### 3. Analyze the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN State (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L(X)=3`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J(NN_final) = L(X)`? `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_final) + L(X)` is odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN State (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L(X)=0`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J(NN_final) = L(X)`? `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_final) + L(X)` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (FAIL - it is even)\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN State (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J(NN_final) = L(X)`? `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_final) + L(X)` is odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN State (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` → `S=3`.\n*   This state is not possible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, this transition is fundamentally not permitted because the final state cannot exist.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe have identified two non-permitted transitions:\n*   **B)** is forbidden by the Pauli statistics selection rule provided in the problem.\n*   **D)** is forbidden because the proposed final state (`7D1`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n\nThe question asks to make use of the specified conservation laws and the Pauli rule. Option (B) is the one that fails these explicit checks on the transition dynamics. Option (D), while impossible, would formally satisfy all three transition rules if such a state could exist. Therefore, the question is most likely targeting the violation of the transition rules themselves.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the partial waves is not permitted.\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three conservation laws and one statistical rule:\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The quantum numbers of the final two-nucleon (NN) system must adhere to the given relation `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n\nLet's first analyze the initial state and the conditions for the final state.\n\n**Initial State: `1S0`**\n*   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have `2S+1 = 1` ⇒ `S = 0`.\n*   The letter 'S' denotes the orbital angular momentum `L = 0`.\n*   The subscript gives the total angular momentum `J = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial NN state is given by `P(NN_i) = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**Particle X**\n*   It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n*   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter: `s` (L=0), `p` (L=1), `d` (L=2), `f` (L=3).\n*   We will assume particle X has no intrinsic spin (`S(X) = 0`), which is a standard assumption for particles like pions denoted this way. Its total angular momentum is therefore `J(X) = L(X)`.\n\n**Conditions for the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics:**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, the isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`. Using the given Pauli statistics relation:\n    `T(NN_f) = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    `0 = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that the sum `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f)` must be **odd**. Any final NN state where `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f)` is even is forbidden.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:**\n    `P(initial) = P(final)`\n    `P(NN_i) = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^L(X)`\n    `(+1) = (-1)^L(NN_f) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`\n    `(+1) = (-1) * (-1)^(L(NN_f) + L(X))`\n    This requires `(-1)^(L(NN_f) + L(X))` to be `-1`, which means the sum `L(NN_f) + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:**\n    `J(initial) = J(final)`\n    The initial angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`.\n    The final total angular momentum `J(final)` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum `J(NN_f)` and particle X's angular momentum `J(X)`. To sum to zero, they must be equal in magnitude: `J(NN_f) = J(X)`.\n    Since we assume `S(X)=0`, we have `J(X) = L(X)`.\n    Therefore, the condition is `J(NN_f) = L(X)`.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Parity check:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 0+1 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **AM check:** `J(NN_f) = 1`, `L(X) = 1`.

For completeness, we check the other laws:\n*   **Parity check:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **AM check:** `J(NN_f) = 0`, `L(X) = 0`. (`0=0`). -> **OK**\n    Despite satisfying parity and angular momentum conservation, the violation of the Pauli principle makes this reaction forbidden.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L(X)=3`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Parity check:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 2+3 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **AM check:** `J(NN_f) = 3`, `L(X) = 3`. (`3=3`). -> **OK**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\nThe only transition that is not permitted is C, as it violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final two-nucleon state.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   Term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`: `1S0`\n*   Total Spin `S(NN_initial)`: `2S+1 = 1` implies `S=0`.\n*   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN_initial)`: The letter `S` corresponds to `L=0`.\n*   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN_initial)`: The subscript is `0`, so `J=0`.\n*   Parity `P(NN_initial)`: The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `(-1)^L`. So, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe system decays into a final two-nucleon state `(NN)_final` and a particle `X`.\n*   `(NN)_final` is described by the term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n*   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is in an orbital angular momentum state `l(X)` relative to the `NN_final` system (denoted by s, p, d, f for `l(X)`=0, 1, 2, 3 respectively).\nWe must apply three main rules: Pauli Statistics, Conservation of Angular Momentum, and Conservation of Parity.\n\n#### Rule 1: Pauli Statistics\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nGiven that the final state has isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`:\n*   `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n*   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd number**.\n\n#### Rule 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum\nThe total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n*   `J_initial = J_final`\n*   `J_initial` is `0` from the `1S0` state.\n*   `J_final` is the vector sum of the final nucleon system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`j(X)`). `j(X)` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l(X)` and its intrinsic spin `s(X)`.\n*   Assuming particle X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion, which is common in such problems and has intrinsic parity -1), then `s(X) = 0` and `j(X) = l(X)`.\n*   The conservation law becomes `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_f) + vec(l(X))`.\n*   `0 = vec(J_f) + vec(l(X))`. This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l(X)`.\n\n#### Rule 3: Conservation of Parity\nThe total parity `P` must be conserved.\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_initial = +1`.\n*   `P_final` is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P(NN)_f`), the intrinsic parity of X (`P(X)`), and the orbital parity of X's motion (`P(l(X))`).\n*   `P(NN)_f = (-1)^L_f`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `P(l(X)) = (-1)^l(X)`\n*   So, the equation is: `+1 = ((-1)^L_f) * (-1) * ((-1)^l(X))`.\n*   `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l(X))`\n*   This implies that `(-1)^(L_f + l(X))` must be equal to `-1`.\n*   Therefore, `L_f + l(X)` must be an **odd number**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nWe will check each option against these three conditions:\n1.  `S_f + L_f` is odd.\n2.  `J_f = l(X)` (assuming `s(X)=0`).\n3.  `L_f + l(X)` is odd.\n\n---\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   This notation is unusual for a two-nucleon system as `2S+1=7` implies `S=3`, which is not possible for two spin-1/2 nucleons. However, we will test it against the given rules.\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2` (D-wave), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l(X) = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = l(X)` -> `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l(X) = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is technically allowed by the rules as stated, despite the physical impossibility of the `S_f=3` state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0` (S-wave), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l(X) = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = l(X)` -> `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2` (D-wave), `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X state (`f`): `l(X) = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = l(X)` -> `3 = 3`. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1` (P-wave), `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X state (`s`): `l(X) = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (**even**). **VIOLATION.**\n2.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = l(X)` -> `0 = 0`. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   This transition violates the Pauli statistics requirement for the final two-nucleon state.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because the final `NN` state `3P0` (`S_f=1`, `L_f=1`) has `S_f + L_f = 2`, which is an even number. This violates the Pauli statistics rule (`S_f + L_f` must be odd) for a `T_f=0` final state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and General Rules\n\n*   **Initial NN State:** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have `1S0` => `2S_i+1=1`, `L_i=S`, `J_i=0`.\n    *   This gives:\n        *   Initial total spin: `S_i = 0`\n        *   Initial total orbital angular momentum: `L_i = 0`\n        *   Initial total angular momentum: `J_i = 0`\n    *   Initial Parity (`P_i`): The parity of the NN system is `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   Initial Isospin (`T_i`): We use the given Pauli statistics rule: `T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   `T_i = S_i + L_i + 1 (mod 2) = 0 + 0 + 1 (mod 2) = 1`.\n        *   So, the initial state has isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity: `P_X = -1` (given).\n    *   Orbital angular momentum: `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f...).\n    *   Spin: `S_X`. This is not given. We'll assume it can take any value required to conserve angular momentum, unless a specific value is forced.\n\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   Isospin: `T_{f,NN} = 0` (given).\n    *   The state is described by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    *   Parity: `P_{f,NN} = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n\n### 2. Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against conservation laws and the given Pauli rule.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. `J_i = J_{final_total}`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`), the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`), and the spin of particle X (`S_X`): `vec{J}_{final_total} = vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X + vec{S}_X`.\n    *   So, we must have `vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X + vec{S}_X = 0`. This implies that a valid (integer or half-integer) spin `S_X` must exist that satisfies the vector sum. This is possible if `|J_f - l_X| <= S_X <= J_f + l_X`. In the special case where `vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X = 0`, then `S_X` must be 0. More commonly in such problems, a simplifying assumption that particle X is spinless (`S_X=0`) is made. This simplifies the condition to `vec{J}_f + vec{l}_X = 0`, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`. Let's test this simpler condition first.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved. `P_i = P_{final}`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   `P_{final} = P_{f,NN} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X}` (Parity of final NN state * intrinsic parity of X * orbital parity of X).\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for Final State:** The rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)` must hold for the final NN state.\n    *   We are given `T_{f,NN} = 0`.\n    *   `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three constraints.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **This violates the condition.**\n*   The final NN state `3P0` has `S+L = 2` (even), which requires it to have isospin `T=1` according to the rule. The problem requires the final state to have `T=0`. Thus, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f = 3`.\n*   This state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Each nucleon has spin 1/2. Their total spin can only be `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet state) or `S = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0` (singlet state). `S=3` cannot be formed.\n*   Because the proposed final state cannot exist, the transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` = odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have found two \"not permitted\" transitions: B and C.\n*   **C** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is impossible for two nucleons (`S_f` cannot be 3). This is a violation of the fundamental properties of the NN system.\n*   **B** is forbidden because the final NN state (`3P0`) has `S_f+L_f=2` (even), which according to the provided Pauli rule, must have `T=1`. This contradicts the given condition that `T_{f,NN}=0`. This violation is a direct application of the rules the question instructed to use.\n\nIn physics problems of this type, one is typically expected to apply the given process rules (conservation laws, specific principles like the Pauli rule) to the options. The violation in option B is a failure to satisfy the Pauli statistics rule for the required isospin, which is one of the specific rules to be checked. The issue in option C is with the definition of the state itself, which is arguably a more fundamental error but might be a typo in the question. Given the explicit instruction to use the Pauli statistics rule, the violation found in option B is the most direct and intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n-   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system.\n-   `1S0` means:\n    -   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    -   `L = S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    -   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n-   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n-   According to the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that the sum `L + S + T` must be an odd integer, where T is the total isospin.\n-   For the initial state: `L_i + S_i + T_i` must be odd. `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which implies the initial isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe decay process is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\nThe final state consists of the two nucleons `NN(final)` and the emitted particle `X`.\n\nWe need to check three conditions for each proposed reaction:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem provides the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. It also specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n    -   Substituting `T=0` into the formula gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    -   This is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which means `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n    -   This is the same as the standard condition `S_f + L_f + T_f` must be odd, since `T_f=0`.\n\n2.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved. `J_i = J_f_total`.\n    -   `J_i = 0`.\n    -   The final total angular momentum `J_f_total` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the angular momentum of particle X.\n    -   The problem denotes the orbital angular momentum of X with a lowercase letter (s, p, d, f...). We'll assume particle X is spinless (`s_X=0`), so its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n    -   Conservation `J_i = 0` requires the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X` to be zero, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n3.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity must be conserved. `P_i = P_f`.\n    -   `P_i = +1`.\n    -   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n    -   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n    -   The intrinsic parity of X is given as `P(X) = -1`.\n    -   The parity associated with the relative orbital motion of X is `(-1)^(l_X)`.\n    -   So, `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    -   Conservation `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)` requires `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`. This means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an odd integer.\n\n**Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition:**\n-   **Condition 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n-   **Condition 2 (J-conservation):** `J_f = l_X`.\n-   **Condition 3 (P-conservation):** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions. A transition is not permitted if it fails even one condition.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n-   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n-   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n-   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  Pauli: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the condition that the sum must be odd.\n    2.  J-conservation: `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n    3.  P-conservation: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n-   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n-   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n-   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n-   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  Pauli: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  J-conservation: `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n    3.  P-conservation: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). Satisfied.\n-   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n-   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n-   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  Pauli: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  J-conservation: `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n    3.  P-conservation: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). Satisfied.\n-   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n-   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` => `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n-   **Note on physical possibility:** A two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is fundamentally not permitted because the final state cannot exist.\n-   However, if we strictly follow the rules provided in the question:\n    1.  Pauli: `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  J-conservation: `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n    3.  P-conservation: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). Satisfied.\n-   This transition satisfies all the explicitly mentioned conservation laws and the provided Pauli rule. The reason it is forbidden is due to a more fundamental principle of angular momentum addition not explicitly listed as a test criterion. In contrast, option A fails one of the explicitly provided criteria. Therefore, A is the intended answer.\n\nBased on the analysis, the transition in option A is the only one that violates the selection rules given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and the Reaction\n- **Initial State:** The system starts as a bound two-nucleon (NN) state `1S0`. We can decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n    - `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the nucleon pair is `S(NN)_initial = 0`.\n    - `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L(NN)_initial = 0`.\n    - `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum of the initial system is `J_initial = 0`.\n- **Initial Parity:** The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n- **The Reaction:** The initial NN system emits a particle X, leading to a final state composed of the NN pair and particle X: `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n- **Particle X:**\n    - It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    - It has an orbital angular momentum `l_X`, where the lowercase letters correspond to `s=0`, `p=1`, `d=2`, `f=3`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Governing Rules and Conservation Laws\nFor a reaction to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant conservation laws and quantum mechanical rules. We will formulate three specific conditions to check based on the problem statement.\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_initial = J_final_total`.\n*   The initial state has `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The final state's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum `J(NN)_final` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`. So, `J_final_total = J(NN)_final + l_X` (vector sum).\n*   The conservation law is `0 = J(NN)_final + l_X`. This vector equation can only be satisfied if the magnitudes of the two angular momenta are equal: `J(NN)_final = l_X`.\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n*   `P_initial = P_final_total`.\n*   We know `P_initial = +1`.\n*   The final state's parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_final_total = P(NN)_final * P(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n    *   `P(NN)_final = (-1)^(L(NN)_final)`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_orbital(X)` is the parity associated with the relative motion of X, which is `(-1)^l_X`.\n*   The conservation equation becomes `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN)_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN)_final + l_X + 1)`.\n*   For this to be true, the exponent `L(NN)_final + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This means `L(NN)_final + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\nThe problem provides a specific condition that the final NN state must satisfy due to the Pauli exclusion principle for `T(NN)=0`.\n*   Given Rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   Given Condition: The final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n*   Substituting the condition into the rule: `0 = S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   For this equality to hold, `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1` must be an even number (since any even number modulo 2 is 0).\n*   This implies that `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Proposed Transition\n\nWe will now test each option against the three derived conditions. A transition is forbidden if it fails even one of them.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J(NN)_final = 3`, `l_X = 3`. They are equal. **(Pass)**\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L(NN)_final + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **(Pass)**\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **(Pass)**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J(NN)_final = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **(Pass)**\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L(NN)_final + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **(Pass)**\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **(Pass)**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7 -> S=3`. `L=D -> L=2`. `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J(NN)_final = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **(Pass)**\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L(NN)_final + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **(Pass)**\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **(Pass)**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted by the rules given in the question. (Note: In physical reality, a two-nucleon system cannot have a total spin S=3, making this state impossible, but it does not violate the specific rules the question asks to check).\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J(NN)_final = 0`, `l_X = 0`. They are equal. **(Pass)**\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L(NN)_final + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **(Pass)**\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(FAIL)**\n*   Conclusion: **Not Permitted.** The sum `S+L` for the final `3P0` state is even, which violates the provided Pauli statistics condition for a `T=0` state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis**\n\nThe initial state of the two-nucleon (NN) system is `1S0`. Using the `(2S+1)L(J)` notation:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the initial total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` implies the initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The number `0` implies the initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The initial parity is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Conservation Laws and Selection Rules**\n\nWe must check each proposed final state against several rules:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Physicality of the Final NN State**\n    A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 fermions) can only have a total spin `S` of 0 (singlet state) or 1 (triplet state). Any final state with a spin other than 0 or 1 is physically impossible. This corresponds to the `2S_f+1` value being 1 or 3.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\n    The total parity of the system must be conserved. The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the parity of the final NN state `P_f = (-1)^L_f` and the parity of the emitted particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1 and is in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X`, so its total parity is `P_X_total = (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    The conservation equation is `P_i = P_f * P_X_total`.\n    `+1 = ((-1)^L_f) * ((-1) * (-1)^l_X)`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd number**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for T(NN) = 0**\n    The problem states that for the final state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that the final NN state has `T(NN) = 0`. Substituting this in:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which in turn means that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd number**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Angular Momentum Conservation**\n    The total angular momentum must be conserved: `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) + vec(J_X)`.\n    Since `J_i = 0`, we must have `vec(J_f) = -vec(J_X)`, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = J_X`. `J_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X, which depends on its unknown spin `S_X`. This rule is less restrictive than the others and is usually satisfied if the other rules are.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Options**\n\nWe now apply these rules to each option. A transition is forbidden if it violates any rule.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final State `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`. Particle `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (State Physicality): `S_f=1` is valid. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli for T=0): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: Permitted.**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final State `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. Particle `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (State Physicality): `S_f=3` is not a possible spin for a two-nucleon system. (VIOLATION)\n*   **Conclusion: Not permitted.**\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final State `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`. Particle `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   Rule 1 (State Physicality): `S_f=1` is valid. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli for T=0): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the requirement that `S_f + L_f` be odd. (VIOLATION)\n*   **Conclusion: Not permitted.**\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final State `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`. Particle `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (State Physicality): `S_f=1` is valid. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli for T=0): `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: Permitted.**\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBoth options B and C describe forbidden transitions.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons.\n*   Option C is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics selection rule that was explicitly given for a final state with `T(NN)=0`.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions where multiple options appear to be correct, it's often the case that one violates a rule specific to the process described in the question, while another violates a more general principle. The question explicitly gives the `T, S, L` relation derived from Pauli statistics as a condition to be checked. Option C fails this specific check. Option B fails a more fundamental check on the existence of the state itself. Often, such questions are designed to test the application of the specific rules mentioned. The violation in option C is a direct contradiction of the given formula under the given condition (`T(NN)=0`), making it the most direct answer to the problem as posed.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the fundamental conservation laws of physics: conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the rules governing the decay `1S0 -> NN_final + X`:\n\n1.  **Initial State (1S0 NN system):**\n    *   The term symbol `1S0` means the initial two-nucleon (NN) system has total spin `S=0`, orbital angular momentum `L=0`, and total angular momentum `J=0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   The generalized Pauli exclusion principle requires the total wavefunction of two identical fermions (the nucleons) to be antisymmetric. This implies that the quantity `L+S+T` must be an odd number, where T is the total isospin. For the `1S0` state, `L=0` and `S=0`, so `0 + 0 + T` must be odd, which means the initial state has isospin `T=1`.\n\n2.  **Particle X:**\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity of -1.\n    *   We assume particle X is a spin-0 particle (like a pseudoscalar meson, e.g., a pion), which is common in such nuclear processes.\n\n3.  **Final State (NN_final + X):**\n    *   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n4.  **Conservation Laws and Selection Rules:**\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle (for the final NN state):** The prompt provides the condition `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. With `T(NN) = 0`, this simplifies to `S(NN) + L(NN) + 1` being an even number, which means `S(NN) + L(NN)` must be **odd**.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n        *   `P(initial) = P(NN_initial) = +1`\n        *   `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l(X)`, where `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)` and `l(X)` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X.\n        *   `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`\n        *   This requires `-1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l(X))`, meaning `L(NN_final) + l(X)` must be **odd**.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n        *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n        *   `J(final)` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum, `J(NN_final)`, and the angular momentum of particle X. Assuming `S(X)=0`, this is `J(final) = J(NN_final) + l(X)`.\n        *   For the sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN_final) = l(X)`.\n\nNow, we will test each option against these three rules:\n1.  `L(f) + S(f)` must be odd.\n2.  `L(f) + l(X)` must be odd.\n3.  `J(f) = l(X)`.\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l(X)=3`.\n1.  `L+S = 2+1 = 3` (odd) -> **OK**\n2.  `L+l(X) = 2+3 = 5` (odd) -> **OK**\n3.  `J=3`, `l(X)=3` -> **OK**\n*This transition is permitted.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S+1=7` implies `S=3`. A two-nucleon system, composed of two spin-1/2 particles, can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, the `7D1` state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. While this immediately makes the transition not permitted, it is likely a typo in the question. If we assume it should be a valid state like `3D1`, the transition would be permitted. Let's analyze the other options, as the question likely intends to test the application of the selection rules.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l(X)=0`.\n1.  `L+S = 1+1 = 2` (even) -> **FAIL**.

This leads to the rule that `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where T is the total isospin. For the initial state, `0 + 0 + T` must be odd, which means `T(NN_initial) = 1`.\n\n2.  **Conservation Laws and Final State Conditions:**\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The initial total angular momentum is `J=0`. Assuming the emitted particle X is a pseudoscalar meson (like a pion with spin 0), the total angular momentum of the final NN state `J(NN_final)` must be equal to the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `L(X)`.\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** The overall parity must be conserved. The initial parity is `+1`. The final parity is `P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^L(X)`. Given that the intrinsic parity of X is `P(X) = -1`, the conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`. This simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X))`, meaning `L(NN_final) + L(X)` must be an odd number.\n    *   **Pauli Principle for the Final State:** The problem states that `T(NN_final) = 0` and that the final state must obey `T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`. With T=0, this means `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`, which simplifies to `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` being an odd number.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p:** The final NN state is `3S1` (`S=1, L=0, J=1`) and X has `L(X)=1`.\n        *   **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+0=1` (odd). **OK**.\n        *   **Angular Momentum:** `J=L(X)` -> `1=1`. **OK**.\n        *   **Parity:** `L+L(X)` odd -> `0+1=1`. **OK**.\n        *   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n    *   **B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f:** The final NN state is `3D3` (`S=1, L=2, J=3`) and X has `L(X)=3`.\n        *   **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+2=3` (odd). **OK**.\n        *   **Angular Momentum:** `J=L(X)` -> `3=3`. **OK**.\n        *   **Parity:** `L+L(X)` odd -> `2+3=5`. **OK**.\n        *   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n    *   **C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p:** The final NN state is specified as `7D1`.\n        *   This term symbol implies `2S+1 = 7`, which would mean the total spin of the two-nucleon system is `S=3`.\n        *   However, nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. When combining two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can only be `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet state) or `S = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0` (singlet state).\n        *   It is fundamentally impossible for a two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3`. Therefore, the final state `7D1` cannot exist for a two-nucleon system. This makes the transition **not permitted**.\n\n    *   **D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s:** The final NN state is `3P0` (`S=1, L=1, J=0`) and X has `L(X)=0`.\n        *   **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+1=2` (even). This violates the condition that `S+L` must be odd for a `T=0` state. Therefore, a `3P0` state with `T=0` is forbidden by the generalized Pauli principle. This transition is also **not permitted**.\n\nBoth options C and D represent forbidden transitions because the proposed final NN state is not physically possible. However, the reason for option C being impossible is more fundamental. The term symbol `7D1` describes a state that is inconsistent with the basic composition of a two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles). The violation in option D requires applying the more nuanced generalized Pauli principle that links orbital, spin, and isospin symmetries. Therefore, the `7D1` state is more flagrantly incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\nThe decay process is:\nInitial Nucleon-Nucleon state (NN_i) → Final Nucleon-Nucleon state (NN_f) + Particle X\n\nWe must check each option against the following physical laws and principles described in the problem:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**: The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P)**: The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle for Nucleons**: For a two-nucleon system, the total state must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that the sum of the orbital angular momentum (L), total spin (S), and isospin (T) quantum numbers must be odd: `L + S + T = odd`. The problem provides an equivalent formula: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n\nLet's first establish the properties of the initial and final states based on the problem description.\n\n### Initial State: `1S0`\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` for `1S0` gives:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1`  ⇒  `S(NN)_i = 0`\n    *   `L` is 'S'   ⇒  `L(NN)_i = 0`\n    *   `J` is 0     ⇒  `J(NN)_i = 0`\n*   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^L(NN)_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### Final State: `NN_f + X`\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is emitted in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3). We assume X is a scalar particle (spin `s_X = 0`).\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n\nNow let's derive the specific selection rules for this decay.\n\n**1. Angular Momentum Conservation (`J_i = J_f`)**:\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the NN state's angular momentum `J(NN)_f` and the particle X's total angular momentum `j_X`. Since we assume `s_X=0`, `j_X = l_X`.\n*   So, `J_f = J(NN)_f + l_X` (vector sum). For `J_f` to be 0, we must have `J(NN)_f = l_X`.\n\n**2. Parity Conservation (`P_i = P_f`)**:\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN)_f * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   `P(NN)_f = (-1)^L(NN)_f`.\n*   `+1 = (-1)^L(NN)_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L(NN)_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   For this to be true, the exponent `L(NN)_f + l_X + 1` must be even, which means `L(NN)_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n**3. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State (`T_f + S_f + L_f = odd`)**:\n*   The problem states `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n*   Therefore, the condition becomes `S(NN)_f + L(NN)_f` must be **odd**.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option against these three rules.\n\n---\n### A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S+1=7` ⇒ `S_f=3`. `L=D` ⇒ `L_f=2`. `J_f=1`.\n*   A state with `S=3` cannot be formed from two spin-1/2 nucleons, whose total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. This transition is not permitted.\n\n### B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_f=3`, `l_X=3`. `J_f = l_X`. (Satisfied)\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (Satisfied)\n3.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (Satisfied)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n### C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_f=0`, `l_X=0`. `J_f = l_X`. (Satisfied)\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Satisfied)\n3.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the requirement that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` state.\n*   This transition is not permitted.\n\n### D) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. `J_f = l_X`. (Satisfied)\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (Satisfied)\n3.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Satisfied)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n---\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **A)** is not permitted because a two-nucleon system cannot have a total spin of S=3.\n*   **C)** is not permitted because the final NN state `3P0` with `T=0` violates the Pauli exclusion principle (`S+L` must be odd, but here `1+1=2` is even).\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, if two options appear to be invalid, one must consider the intent of the question. The problem explicitly provides the formula for the Pauli principle and specifies the final isospin state `T=0`. This suggests that the primary skill being tested is the application of all selection rules, particularly the non-trivial Pauli constraint. Option (C) is forbidden precisely by this rule, after satisfying the conservation laws of angular momentum and parity. The issue with option (A) is a more basic error in the construction of a valid quantum state for two nucleons, which could potentially be a typo (`7` instead of `3`). Assuming the question is designed to test the detailed selection rules provided, the violation in (C) is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
