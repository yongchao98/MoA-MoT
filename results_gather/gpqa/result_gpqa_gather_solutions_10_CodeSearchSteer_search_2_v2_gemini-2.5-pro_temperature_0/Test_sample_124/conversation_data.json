We need to find the energy and the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) of the third excited state.\n\n**1. Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be solved by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates. The potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.

Degeneracy**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to get $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. Let's list the possible combinations:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — 3 states.\n2.

This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., it depends only on the distance $r$ from the origin.\n\n2.  **Set up the Hamiltonian:**\n    In Cartesian coordinates, the radial distance squared is $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. The potential can be written as:\n    $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$.\n    The total Hamiltonian $H$ is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(x, y, z)$\n    $H = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2\\right)$\n    This shows that the 3D Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent 1D harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians: $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    Since the Hamiltonian is separable, the total energy eigenvalue $E$ is the sum of the energy eigenvalues from each of the three 1D harmonic oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n    Therefore, the total energy for the 3D system is:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    We can define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n4.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of $N$.\n    *   **Ground State (0th excited state):** $N=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $N=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    We can list all possible combinations:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) --- (3 states)\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n        *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) --- (6 states)\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        *   (1, 1, 1) --- (1 state)\n    The total number of combinations is the sum of these counts: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Therefore, the degeneracy of the third excited state is 10. This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing 1D and 3D Oscillators:** The ground state energy for a 1D oscillator is $(\\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, while for a 3D isotropic oscillator it is $(\\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Identifying Excited States:** The ground state corresponds to $N=0$. The \"third excited state\" corresponds to $N=3$, not $n=3$.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator for a given $N$ can be calculated quickly with the formula $g(N) = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$. For $N=3$, this gives $g(3) = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$. This confirms the manual counting.\n*   **Eliminating Incorrect Options:** Options C and D present an energy formula proportional to $1/r^2$, which is characteristic of the energy for a particle in an infinite spherical well, not a harmonic oscillator. They can be dismissed immediately.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (its degeneracy) is 10.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalues:** The potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$ describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.

We need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\nThe possible combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are:\n*   One number is 3, others are 0:\n    (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — 3 states\n*   One number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n    (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — 6 states\n*   All numbers are 1:\n    (1, 1, 1) — 1 state\n\nThe total number of states is the sum of these possibilities:\nDegeneracy $g_3 = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy of the N-th level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $N=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThus, the third excited state has an energy of $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and a degeneracy of 10.

Identify the Physical System:**\nThe problem describes a quantum mechanical particle of mass $m$ moving in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by:\n$V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$\nwhere $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. This potential is \"isotropic\" because it depends only on the distance from the origin, $r$, and not on the direction.\n\n**2. Choose a Suitable Coordinate System:**\nThis problem can be solved using either Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ or spherical polar coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$. Both methods will lead to the same result for the energy levels and their degeneracies. We will use the Cartesian coordinate approach as it is often more straightforward for this specific potential.\n\n**3. Analyze the Hamiltonian in Cartesian Coordinates:**\nThe potential can be written as the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n$V(x, y, z) = V_x(x) + V_y(y) + V_z(z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$\nBecause the potential is separable, the total energy eigenvalue $E$ is the sum of the energy eigenvalues of the three independent 1D harmonic oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n\n**4.

The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n    The energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator in quantum state $n_i$ is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i$ can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    For the 3D system, the total energy is:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    Combining these gives:\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    We can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are thus given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n2.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number $n$.\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the state with the lowest energy, corresponding to $n=0$. Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$. Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$. Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$. Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    The value of the energy for the third excited state is therefore $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Find the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (combinations of $n_x, n_y, n_z$) that have the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of ways to choose three non-negative integers that sum to 3 ($n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$).\n    *   **Enumeration Method:**\n        1.  (3, 0, 0) and its permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n        2.  (2, 1, 0) and its permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n        3.  (1, 1, 1): This has only one arrangement. This gives 1 state.\n        The total degeneracy is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    *   **Formula Method:** The degeneracy $g_n$ for the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n        For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n    Both methods yield a degeneracy of 10. This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **System Type:** It is crucial to identify the potential as a harmonic oscillator, not a particle in a spherical box. The energy eigenvalues for a particle in a box are proportional to $1/L^2$ (or $1/r^2$ for a spherical well), which is incorrect here. This eliminates options A and B.\n*   **State Indexing:** The ground state corresponds to $n=0$, not $n=1$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to the quantum number $n=3$.\n*   **Energy Formula Constant:** The energy formula for the 3D case has a zero-point energy of $\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, not $\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ which is for the 1D case.\n*   **Degeneracy Value:** A degeneracy of 3 corresponds to the first excited state ($n=1$), not the third. It is important to calculate the degeneracy for the correct value of $n=3$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3\nB) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10\nC) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$\nD) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n\nThe calculated values exactly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., it depends only on the distance $r$ from the origin.\n\n2.  **Set up the Hamiltonian:**\n    In Cartesian coordinates, the radial distance squared is $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. The potential can be written as:\n    $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$.\n    The total Hamiltonian $H$ is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(x, y, z)$\n    $H = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2\\right)$\n    This shows that the 3D Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent 1D harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians: $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    Since the Hamiltonian is separable, the total energy eigenvalue $E$ is the sum of the energy eigenvalues from each of the three 1D harmonic oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n    Therefore, the total energy for the 3D system is:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    We can define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n4.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of $N$.\n    *   **Ground State (0th excited state):** $N=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $N=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    We can list all possible combinations:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) --- (3 states)\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n        *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) --- (6 states)\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        *   (1, 1, 1) --- (1 state)\n    The total number of combinations is the sum of these counts: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Therefore, the degeneracy of the third excited state is 10. This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing 1D and 3D Oscillators:** The ground state energy for a 1D oscillator is $(\\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, while for a 3D isotropic oscillator it is $(\\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Identifying Excited States:** The ground state corresponds to $N=0$. The \"third excited state\" corresponds to $N=3$, not $n=3$.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator for a given $N$ can be calculated quickly with the formula $g(N) = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$. For $N=3$, this gives $g(3) = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$. This confirms the manual counting.\n*   **Eliminating Incorrect Options:** Options C and D present an energy formula proportional to $1/r^2$, which is characteristic of the energy for a particle in an infinite spherical well, not a harmonic oscillator. They can be dismissed immediately.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (its degeneracy) is 10.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalues:** The potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$ describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe energy levels are determined as follows:\n*   **Ground state:** n = 0, $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First excited state:** n = 1, $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state:** n = 2, $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state:** n = 3, $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy) is given by the formula:\n\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have n = 3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
