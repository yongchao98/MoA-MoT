Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (C=O or C=C) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric stretches, respectively.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region, indicating a C=O group. This value is typical for a conjugated ester or an aldehyde. Given the DoU calculation, this C=O group likely accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm is quite downfield, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen: an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), most likely as part of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for the exchangeable protons of an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH). Combined with the IR data, this signal confirms the primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group).\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group, -COOEt).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify with the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the NMR would show a quartet for the CH₂ next to the carbonyl at ~2.2-2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern. It is also an amide, and the C=O stretch is usually at a lower frequency.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR and only one N-H proton in the NMR.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified by breaking down the information from each spectrum and comparing it with the proposed structures.\n\n### **Analysis of Provided Data**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated to be 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is typical for an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the interpretation of the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, point to a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure, also known as Benzocaine, has a para-substituted benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂):** Matches.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester. This is consistent with the observed N-H and C=O stretches.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Contains an ethoxy group, a primary amine, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups. This perfectly matches all the observed signals and their splitting patterns.\n\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. While the formula matches, the NMR would show a propionyl group (a triplet and quartet at much higher field, ~1.1 and ~2.5 ppm respectively) instead of an ethoxy group. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure has a primary amide (-CONH₂) and meta-substitution. The IR carbonyl stretch for an amide is typically at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR aromatic region would show a more complex pattern for meta-substitution, not two doublets. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-). It would show only one N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, not two. The NMR would show a signal for only one amide proton, not two, and would also feature a very downfield formyl proton (H-C=O) signal. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral data—molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR—are fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nDBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\nA DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the DBE and the presence of two oxygen atoms, this is very likely an ester group. The frequency is a bit low for a simple alkyl ester, suggesting conjugation with the aromatic ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which aligns with the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule contains:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an ester, but the ethyl group is on the acid side (propionate), not the alcohol side. The NMR would show a -O-C6H4-NH2 pattern, and the propionate group would have different shifts.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H peak in the IR and NMR.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a para-substituted ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the correct chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given Data\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    ir_data = [\"3420 cm-1 (N-H stretch)\", \"3325 cm-1 (N-H stretch)\", \"1720 cm-1 (C=O stretch)\"]\n    nmr_data = {\n        \"1.20 ppm\": \"t, 3H\",\n        \"4.0 ppm\": \"bs, 2H\",\n        \"4.5 ppm\": \"q, 2H\",\n        \"7.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\",\n        \"8.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\"\n    }\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"B\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\",\n        \"C\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"D\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step Analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.

A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation typically corresponds to a double bond, such as a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands in the N-H stretching region is a classic signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out secondary amides (one band) and tertiary amides/amines (no bands in this region).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n    *   This frequency is typical for an **ester group conjugated with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR)**. Simple alkyl esters are usually at a slightly higher frequency (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), but conjugation lowers the frequency.\n    *   It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   It is too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760-1770 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule (n=2) means this methyl group is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Fragment:** -CH₂-CH₃\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule (n=3) means this methylene group is adjacent to the methyl (-CH₃) group identified above.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH₂ group. This high value is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-C(=O)-O-**CH₂**-).\n    *   **Fragment:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons like those on N-H or O-H groups. This signal is consistent with the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Indicates four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (lower ppm). The ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield (higher ppm). Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the structure consists of:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\nAssembling these pieces gives **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine, not amide) and NMR (para substitution pattern).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The IR C=O stretch would also be at a higher frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl group, para-substituted ring, and amine protons in the NMR.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine). It would also show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal in the NMR, which is absent.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O group).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester. It is too high for a simple amide (~1660 cm⁻¹) and in the correct range for an α,β-unsaturated or aryl ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the two substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group (EDG).\n*   The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n*   Placing these on the ring in a para-arrangement: The protons ortho to the donating -NH₂ group will be shielded and appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group will be deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and have an N-H proton integrating to 1H in the NMR. The C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- protons would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with appropriate electronic effects reflected in the NMR chemical shifts. The molecular formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ is also correct.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide, and its C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1660 cm⁻¹). Also, as a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) ring, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the formula and other data, this is likely an ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is the first part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl).\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data: the molecular formula, the degree of unsaturation, and the IR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data provided corresponds to the following compound:\n\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is `(2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2`.\n    *   (2 * 9 + 2 + 1 - 11 - 0) / 2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 11) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5.\n*   A degree of unsaturation of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH2-). This pattern, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is a classic signal for the two protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar relaxation from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, the fragments are:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only structure that fits all the data is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and its NMR spectrum would be different.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl, showing a quartet around 2.3-2.6 ppm, which contradicts the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data: the molecular formula, the IR bands for a primary amine and a conjugated ester, and the ¹H NMR signals for an ethyl ester, a primary aromatic amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide and is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula can be used to calculate the degree of unsaturation, which indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, this is very likely an ester, which usually appears between 1750-1715 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group. This pattern is characteristic of the methyl part of an ethyl group (-CH₂**CH₃**).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons is a quartet (q), meaning it is adjacent to a -CH₃ group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom within an ester (-COO**CH₂**CH₃). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-**NH₂**). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals, both doublets (d) and each integrating to 2 protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts for the aromatic protons mean the two substituents on the ring have different electronic effects. The electron-donating amino group (-NH₂) shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   The molecule contains a **primary amine** (-NH₂).\n*   It contains an **ethyl ester** group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **1,4 (para) arrangement**.\n\nThis information leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and has a secondary amine (N-H), which would show only one IR band.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group is part of the propionate, not the ester's alcohol portion. The NMR would be different.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted (1,3) amide, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern and the IR data.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data. The ¹H NMR data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate shows a triplet at ~1.35 ppm, a quartet at ~4.31 ppm, a broad singlet for the amine protons, and two doublets for the aromatic protons at ~6.62 and ~7.84 ppm, which is consistent with the provided data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The DBE is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds.\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    DBE = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond (1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region is characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester**, specifically an aromatic ester. It is generally too high for an amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents are electronically different. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified from the IR spectrum. Its broadness is due to quadrupole broadening and chemical exchange. The -NH₂ group is an electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is characteristic of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the methyl (-CH₃) protons, which are split by the two adjacent methylene protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks).\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene (-CH₂) protons, which are split by the three adjacent methyl protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks).\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the methylene quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester group (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group, consistent with the downfield aromatic doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPlacing the electron-donating -NH₂ group and the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the spectral data.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, primary amine, ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. Also, 1,3-substitution would produce a more complex aromatic NMR pattern.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this ester, the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for this methylene group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and one N-H proton in the NMR. It would also have a formyl proton (-CHO) signal above 8 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide N-H stretch is typically at a slightly lower frequency.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide (which is usually < 1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3), such as a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This pattern (a 3H triplet) is classic for the methyl part of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a group with three protons (3+1=4), such as a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**, which is part of an ester.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals for 2H are often due to exchangeable protons, like those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Given the IR data, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield (deshielded) compared to those at 7.0 ppm. This indicates that the ring is substituted with both an electron-donating group (EDG) and an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n        *   The -NH₂ group is a strong EDG, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to ~7.0 ppm).\n        *   The ester group (-COOR) is an EWG, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This compound is also known as Benzocaine.\n\n**5. Verifying the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all spectral data perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The NMR would show a -CO-CH₂- quartet around 2.5 ppm, not a -O-CH₂- quartet at 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR would show one N-H band and an amide C=O band (~1670 cm⁻¹). Incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide and is meta-substituted. The IR C=O band would be incorrect, and the aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex than two doublets. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic spectroscopy problem. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step to deduce the structure of the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nFor C9H11NO2:\n*   C = 9 (carbons)\n*   H = 11 (hydrogens)\n*   N = 1 (nitrogen)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\n**DoU = 5**\n\nA DoU of 4 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring. The additional degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests the presence of one double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is also supported by the IR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show one band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. An amide carbonyl typically appears at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons, indicating a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split by 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This means the -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n    *   This suggests a **-CH₂-CH₃** fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons, indicating a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split by 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This means the -CH₂ group is next to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂ group, which indicates it is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (**-O-CH₂-**).\n    *   Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm, we can confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for protons on heteroatoms that can undergo chemical exchange, such as -OH or -NH protons.\n    *   Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH₂ group**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** This symmetrical pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are further downfield because they are ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing ester group. The protons at 7.0 ppm are more upfield because they are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Final Conclusion**\n\nPutting all the pieces together:\n1.  We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of the acid portion (CH₃CH₂COO-). The NMR for the -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (N-H stretching) is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band corresponds to the asymmetric stretch and the other to the symmetric stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region.

Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (2+1=3), which is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This is the -CH₃ part of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (3+1=4), which is a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significantly downfield shift for a -CH₂- group. This high value is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom that is part of an ester (-C(=O)-O-**CH₂**-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)** attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester fragment.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of amine protons (-NH₂), which often appear broad due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the primary amine found in the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Indicates four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield), meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (further upfield), meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4.

It has the correct formula (C9H11NO2), a primary amine, a conjugated ester, an ethoxy group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with the expected chemical shifts.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester. The C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). The aromatic region would show a more complex pattern for meta-substitution, not two doublets.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. The NMR would show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8 ppm and an N-H proton, not an -NH₂ signal.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The ester group is -O-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at a much lower chemical shift (~2.2-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and IR Spectrum\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal, a triplet integrating to three hydrogens, suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two hydrogens is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂) next to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, such as an oxygen in an ester (-COOCH₂-). Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) attached to an ester oxygen.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two hydrogens is a classic signal for the protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two hydrogens, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-donating amino group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### 3. Structure Determination\n\nBased on the combined data:\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The NMR data confirms a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. The spectroscopic data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate found in literature is consistent with the data provided.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of Other Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amine (would show one N-H band in IR) and an amide, which is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has a propionate group, not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show a methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl around 2.2-2.5 ppm, which is not observed.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, and the aromatic substitution is meta, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR than two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the data uniquely identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated as follows: `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    For C9H11NO2, this is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n    A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the molecular formula and other data, this is consistent with an ester.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding and quadrupolar relaxation. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield doublet (~7.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂), while the downfield doublet (~8.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n    The data points to a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group. Assembling these pieces gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n    Let's check this against the given options:\n    *   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and has a different NMR pattern.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure, also known as Benzocaine, perfectly matches all the data:\n        *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n        *   **IR:** Has a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester carbonyl (C=O).\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Has an ethyl ester group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. Published spectra for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate show signals at approximately 1.35 ppm (t, 3H), 4.16 ppm (s, br, 2H, -NH₂), 4.31 ppm (q, 2H), 6.62 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.84 ppm (d, 2H), which are in excellent agreement with the provided data.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group attached to the phenolic oxygen. The NMR signal for the -CH₂- next to the carbonyl would be much further upfield (around 2.3-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, and the carbonyl IR stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). The aromatic substitution is meta, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe spectroscopic data is unequivocally consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic sign of a primary amine (-NH2). These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, like the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield signal at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Structure Determination\n\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   The formula is C9H11NO2 and the DoU is 5.\n*   The IR spectrum shows a primary amine (-NH2) and a carbonyl group (C=O), likely an ester.\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of an ethyl group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure is a benzene ring substituted with an amino group and an ethyl ester group at positions 1 and 4. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group would be part of the propionate, and its methylene protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl, appearing at a much higher field (around 2.3 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, and its IR C=O stretch would likely be at a lower frequency. It would also show a signal for the formyl proton (H-C=O) in the NMR, which is absent.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) benzene, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This value is characteristic of an ester, which is often found between 1715-1750 cm⁻¹. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests it might be conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. An amide C=O stretch is usually found at a lower frequency (1630-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity means it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) in an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet (q) multiplicity means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (a -CH₃ group). This is the corresponding methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group. The downfield chemical shift of 4.5 ppm indicates that this -CH₂- group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom in an ester (-COO-CH₂-) or ether (Ar-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. This signal, combined with the IR data, is definitively the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid or water.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets indicates that one substituent is a strong electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), and the other is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n    *   An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)\n    *   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n    *   An ester carbonyl group (C=O)\n*   The -NH₂ group is an EDG, and an ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is an EWG. Placing these two groups in a para (1,4) position on the benzene ring satisfies all the NMR and IR data.\n*   The proposed structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify the Proposed Structure with the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃.\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. Correct.\n    *   **IR:** Contains -NH₂ and a conjugated ester C=O. Correct.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Contains an ethyl group, a para-disubstituted ring with an EDG and EWG, and an -NH₂ group. All chemical shifts and multiplicities match the data. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is CH₃CH₂COO-C₆H₄-NH₂. The CH₂ group would be a quartet around 2.6 ppm (next to C=O), not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets. Also, it is a primary amide, which has a C=O stretch at a lower frequency (~1660 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. It would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and a 1H signal for the N-H proton in the NMR. It would also have a formyl proton (CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2, we must analyze the given spectroscopic data step-by-step.\n\n### Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are highly characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). Primary amines show two bands due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching, whereas secondary amines show only one.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring, which shifts the absorption to a slightly lower wavenumber compared to a saturated ester.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can infer the presence of a primary amine (-NH2) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n### Analysis of the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents three protons, and its triplet (t) splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group. This is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group that is part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for two protons appears as a quartet (q), meaning it is adjacent to a -CH3 group. The significant downfield chemical shift (around 3.5-4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- group is bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. Combined with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethyl ester group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a classic signal for the hydrogens of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to factors like quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. This supports the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets (d) in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The upfield shift to 7.0 ppm is caused by an electron-donating group (the -NH2 group), while the downfield shift to 8.0 ppm is caused by an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOCH2CH3 group).\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nCombining all the pieces of evidence:\n1.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring to which these two groups are attached.\n\nThe structure that fits all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is consistent with this structure. The spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate from literature sources confirms these assignments.\n\nLet's review the other options:\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This would show a more complex pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR (not two doublets) due to meta-substitution. Also, the amide C=O stretch in the IR would typically be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H peak in the IR spectrum. Its ¹H NMR would show a single N-H proton signal and a formyl proton signal.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has a propionate group, not an ethyl ester attached to the ring. The NMR signal for the -CH2- group of the propionate would be a quartet around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not the 4.5 ppm observed, as it would be adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, not the ester oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the data conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    First, I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to get a clue about the structure.\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (which accounts for 1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic sign of a primary amine (-NH2). These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This specific frequency is typical for an ester, which is generally found between 1750-1715 cm-1. It is too high for a simple amide C=O.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The quartet's downfield chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is an oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH2CH3), likely part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The signal is broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shift difference suggests the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   From the analysis, we have the following fragments: a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Putting these pieces together gives us ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n    *   Let's check this against the options:\n        *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta, not para) and it's a primary amide, not an ester.\n        *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n        *   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n        *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but it contains a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group. The NMR would be different (the quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm).\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data provided:\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    ir_data = \"medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1; strong band at 1720 cm-1\"\n    nmr_data = \"1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"B\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"C\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\",\n        \"D\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\"\n    }\n\n    # Step-by-step reasoning based on the data\n    analysis = [\n        \"1.

This is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct compound is:\nC) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) or Double Bond Equivalent.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DBE of 5 indicates a high degree of unsaturation. This is very characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE). The additional unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) suggested by the IR data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH2). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. A conjugated ketone would also be in this region, but an ester is more likely given the other data. It is generally too high for a simple amide C=O (usually < 1700 cm-1).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic proton region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The splitting pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The large separation in chemical shifts (7.0 ppm vs 8.0 ppm) means one substituent is a strong electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the adjacent protons and shifts them upfield (to 7.0 ppm). The other is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields its adjacent protons and shifts them downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   This signal represents 3 protons, indicating a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The triplet (t) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This signal represents 2 protons, indicating a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   The quartet (q) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH3 group).\n    *   The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) for the -CH2- group is characteristic of it being attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group, which confirms the IR data.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure**\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  The amine group (-NH2) is an EDG. The ester group (-COOR) is an EWG.\n4.  Attaching these groups to the para positions of the benzene ring gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n5.  This structure is fully consistent with all spectral data. The -NH2 group makes the ortho protons appear upfield at 7.0 ppm, and the -COOEt group makes its ortho protons appear downfield at 8.0 ppm. The ethyl group and amine protons are also perfectly accounted for.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an ester of a phenol. The NMR would show a quartet for a -CH2- group next to a carbonyl, which would be much further upfield (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR and a 1H signal for the amide proton in the NMR. It lacks the 2H signal for a primary amine.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) compound, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. The frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pattern is the unmistakable signal of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃), split by the two adjacent methylene protons.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-), split by the three adjacent methyl protons. The significantly downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an **ethyl ester group (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This signal confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified in the IR spectrum. The protons are exchangeable, causing the signal to broaden.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a clear sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group are shielded and appear upfield (7.0 ppm).\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group are deshielded and appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nPutting all the pieces together:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. Has a secondary amide, not a primary amine.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. Is 1,3-substituted (meta) and a primary amide.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The ethyl group would be part of a propionate (-CO-CH₂CH₃), and its methylene quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly fits all the provided IR and NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectral data, the correct compound is identified by systematically evaluating each option.\n\n### **Analysis of Provided Data**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two distinct bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm-1** is typical for the C=O stretch of a carbonyl group, specifically an aromatic ester.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-). Together, the signals at 1.20 and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)** attached to the carbonyl carbon of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is indicative of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar relaxation from the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield due to the deshielding effect of the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield due to the electron-donating effect of the amino group.\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure, also known as Benzocaine, has a primary amine (-NH2), an ethyl ester group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. This structure perfectly matches all the IR and 1H NMR data, including the chemical formula C9H11NO2.\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This compound is a primary amide, not an ester. The C=O stretch for an amide would be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1), which contradicts the IR band at 1720 cm-1. Also, as a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) benzene, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only a single N-H stretch in the IR spectrum and a 1H signal for the N-H proton in the NMR, contradicting the data indicating a primary amine (-NH2) with two N-H stretches and two protons.\n\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This compound is a phenyl ester with a propionate group (-CO-CH2CH3). The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- group adjacent to the carbonyl at around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. The data clearly shows an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), not a propionate group.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral evidence points unequivocally to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula & Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `(2C + 2 + N - H) / 2 = (2*9 + 2 + 1 - 11) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5`. This value strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and an additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** indicates a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. This frequency is typical for an ester, which is consistent with the presence of two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula. Published data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate show IR absorption bands at 3424 cm-1, 3345 cm-1, and a carbonyl stretch at 1685 cm-1. The provided data is in close agreement.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet, integrating to three protons, is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2) next to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, forming an **ethyl ester (-OCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is indicative of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. The protons are broad due to exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe data pieces together to form a single structure:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR would show a propionate group, not an ethyl ester attached to the oxygen.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This would show a single N-H stretch in the IR for the secondary amide and a formyl proton signal in the NMR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. All spectroscopic data perfectly match this structure. Published 1H NMR data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms the observed chemical shifts: δ 1.36 (t, 3H), 4.04 (br s, 2H), 4.31 (q, 2H), 6.63 (d, 2H), and 7.85 (d, 2H). These values are very close to the data provided in the problem.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide and would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR due to 1,3-substitution.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Here is a detailed breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion.\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A calculation reveals 5 degrees of unsaturation. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically in the range expected for an ester. The value is too high for an amide and fits well for an aromatic ester.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl (-CH3) group that is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2) group, which splits it into a triplet. This is the \"ethyl\" part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H):** This signal is from a methylene (-CH2) group adjacent to a methyl (-CH3) group, resulting in a quartet. Its significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates it is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of the ester group (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to chemical exchange and nitrogen's quadrupolar effects.\n*   **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two doublets, each integrating to two protons, arise from the symmetry of the ring. The protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group are shifted upfield (around 7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group are shifted significantly downfield (around 8.0 ppm).\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- next to the carbonyl group at a much lower chemical shift (~2.3-2.6 ppm).\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show a single N-H band in the IR spectrum and a 1H signal for the amide proton in the NMR, not the two bands and 2H signal for a primary amine.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. All spectroscopic data perfectly match this structure, also known as Benzocaine. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring, consistent with all IR and NMR signals.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. The C=O stretch for an amide is typically at a lower frequency (~1650-1680 cm⁻¹). Also, a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) ring would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThis is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n*   C = 9 (carbon atoms)\n*   H = 11 (hydrogen atoms)\n*   N = 1 (nitrogen atom)\n*   O = 2 (oxygen atoms, which don't affect the calculation)\n*   X = 0 (halogen atoms)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\nA DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 3 for double bonds and 1 for the ring) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other is for the symmetric N-H stretch. This information immediately rules out option D, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is typical for an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. Combined with the DoU calculation, this strongly suggests a structure with a benzene ring and a C=O group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in chemical shift (7.0 vs. 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group, and the ester group (-COOR) is a strong electron-withdrawing group.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is very downfield, which indicates that the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). If it were an ethoxy group attached directly to the ring (-O-CH₂CH₃), the shift would be closer to 4.0 ppm. If it were part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃), the shift would be around 2.5-3.0 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) identified from the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange. Its position is consistent with an amino group attached to an aromatic ring.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options:**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule contains:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's combine these pieces. The two substituents on the benzene ring must be the -NH₂ group and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group. This gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has an NH₂ and a para-substituted ring, but the ester linkage is different (Ar-O-CO-Et). The NMR for the ethyl group would be different (quartet at ~2.5 ppm).\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure (H₂N-Ar-CO-O-Et) perfectly matches all the data. The para-substituted ring with an electron-donating group (NH₂) and an electron-withdrawing group (COOEt) explains the two doublets. The ethyl ester fragment explains the triplet and the highly deshielded quartet. The primary amine explains the two IR bands and the broad NMR singlet.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data (which shows a primary amine).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectral data unequivocally points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 10/2 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2 group). One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other is for the symmetric N-H stretch.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an aryl ester (a C=O group attached to a benzene ring), which are often found around 1715-1730 cm-1. It is too high for a typical amide C=O (usually < 1700 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an ester (-O-CH2CH3) or an ether. Given the IR data, an ethyl ester is the most likely conclusion.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, which often results in a broad signal. The chemical shift is appropriate for an aniline-type amine (an amine attached to a benzene ring).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting the adjacent protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting the adjacent protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  The amine group is electron-donating, and the ester group is electron-withdrawing. This perfectly explains the aromatic proton shifts: the protons next to the donating -NH2 group are at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm), and the protons next to the withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group are at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm).\n    4.  The structure is therefore 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, or **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3). The NMR quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This has an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1. Also, the substitution is meta (1,3), which would not produce two simple doublets in the NMR.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This contains a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular Formula, DoU, IR, and 1H NMR).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** This calculation helps determine the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 π-bonds) plus one additional π-bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the classic signature for the N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would typically show only a single band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption band in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (typically 1730-1715 cm⁻¹). This frequency is too high to be an amide, which usually appears at a lower frequency (<1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's interpret each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH₃). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group (since n+1=3, n=2). This is the start of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The quartet (q) splitting confirms it is adjacent to a methyl group (since n+1=4, n=3). The very downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to the oxygen of an ester (-COO-**CH₂**-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for two protons in this region is characteristic of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and the quadrupolar nature of the nitrogen atom. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region, confirming the benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are shielded (upfield) because they are adjacent to the electron-donating amine group. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded (downfield) because they are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the combined evidence:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow let's check the given options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, inconsistent with both the IR and NMR data.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this structure, the ethyl group would be part of the propionate group (-OCOCH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for that CH₂ group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe user has provided spectral data (IR, 1H NMR) and a molecular formula (C9H11NO2) and asks to identify the correct structure from four options.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    *   The code execution confirms that all four options (A, B, C, D) are isomers with this formula.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group. All options contain a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, so this is consistent.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A primary amide (-CONH2) also shows two bands, but a secondary amide (-NH-) would show only one. This fact makes option A, a secondary amide, highly unlikely.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is for a carbonyl (C=O) group. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. A conjugated amide (like in option C) typically absorbs at a lower frequency (around 1680 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is a definitive signature for an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-O-CH2-CH3)**. The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the -CH3 group, split by the adjacent two protons of the -CH2- group. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the -CH2- group, split by the adjacent three protons of the -CH3 group. The very downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is crucial and confirms the -CH2- is bonded to a highly electronegative oxygen atom.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH2)**, which confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The large separation in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Combined Data:**\n\n    *   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR and the 2H -NH2 signal in the NMR. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n        *   Has a primary amine (-NH2): Matches IR and the 4.0 ppm NMR signal.\n        *   Is an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3): Matches the C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the ethyl group signals (triplet at 1.20 ppm, quartet at 4.5 ppm) in the NMR.\n        *   Is 1,4-disubstituted: Matches the two-doublet pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR. The electron-donating -NH2 and electron-withdrawing -COOEt groups explain the large chemical shift difference.\n        *   **This structure is a perfect match for all the data.**\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets. Also, the C=O is an amide, which is a poorer fit for the 1720 cm⁻¹ IR band. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group in this structure is part of a propionate group (-O-CO-CH2CH3). The -CH2- group is adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear as a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm in the NMR, not at 4.5 ppm. **Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only structure that is fully consistent with all the provided spectral data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Here is a breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion:\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, such as a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, specifically in the range for an ester.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic pattern for a para- (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The significant difference in chemical shift between the two doublets suggests one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the protons, moving them upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the protons, moving them downfield to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group (-NH₂) is donating, and the ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is withdrawing, which perfectly fits this observation.\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):**\n    *   The triplet at **1.20 ppm (3H)** corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   The quartet at **4.5 ppm (2H)** corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group. The downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is indicative of the methylene group being attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, confirming the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) as part of an ester.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** The broad singlet at **4.0 ppm integrating to 2H** is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom.\n\n### Conclusion by Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure contains a para-substituted benzene ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group. All features perfectly match the IR and ¹H NMR data. Spectroscopic data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as Benzocaine) confirms these spectral features.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and one N-H proton in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR, not two clean doublets.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this isomer, the quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl, shifting its signal to a much more upfield position (around 2.2-2.6 ppm), which contradicts the observed shift at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, all the provided evidence points unequivocally to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a clear indication of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is typical for an ester.\n\nCombining these observations, the compound is likely a primary amine containing an ester group.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The molecular formula C9H11NO2 has a degree of unsaturation of 5. (Calculated as: 9 - 11/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 5). A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for one, which fits the data.\n\n*   **Signal-by-Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet and integrates to three protons. This pattern is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet and integrates to two protons. This is typical for a methylene group (-CH₂) next to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift of ~4.5 ppm indicates that this methylene group is attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH₂-). Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are both doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons. This pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is due to protons adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n### Structure Determination and Evaluation of Options\n\nAssembling the identified fragments—a primary amine, an ethoxy group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring—leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data analyzed. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. The predicted chemical shifts and IR frequencies match the provided data.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amine (an amide), which would show only a single N-H stretch in the IR, and its C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency. This contradicts the IR data.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has a propionyloxy group (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃), not an ethoxy group. The methylene protons of the propionyl group would appear as a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide with a 1,3- (meta) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The NMR would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the data unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo identify the compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2, we must analyze the provided spectroscopic data and compare it with the proposed structures.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):** The first step is to calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is ((2 * 9 + 2) - 11 + 1) / 2 = 5. The presence of a benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for the fifth. This suggests the presence of a substituted benzene ring containing a carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two medium to strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration, likely from an ester group, which typically appears in the 1750-1700 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a classic sign of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is a very common signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons, coupled with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester linkage (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The difference in chemical shifts suggests one substituent is electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the propionate, not the alcohol portion. Its -CH₂- signal in the NMR would be around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure has a meta-substituted ring, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets. Also, the carbonyl stretch for an amide is typically at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is consistent with all the data.\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2.\n    *   **IR:** It has a primary amine (-NH₂) for the 3420/3325 cm⁻¹ bands and an ester carbonyl for the 1720 cm⁻¹ band.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It contains an ethyl ester group, which accounts for the triplet at ~1.3 ppm and the quartet at ~4.3 ppm. It has a primary amine (-NH₂) that would show as a broad singlet around 4.0-4.2 ppm. The para-substituted ring with an electron-donating amine and an electron-withdrawing ester group explains the two doublets in the aromatic region. The reference spectra for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirm these assignments.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR spectrum would show only one N-H stretch, not two. The NMR would show a signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) at around 8.0-8.5 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combination of a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring perfectly matches the provided spectral data. Therefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   DoU = C - H/2 - N/2 + 1\n*   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O), which accounts for the fifth degree.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH₂ group), corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester or an aldehyde/ketone. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, an ester is highly likely.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets implies that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding the ortho protons, causing an upfield shift to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons, causing a downfield shift to ~8.0 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum. Its position is consistent with an amine attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals (a triplet and a quartet) is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) protons are split into a **triplet** by the adjacent 2 protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The methylene group (-CH₂) protons are split into a **quartet** by the adjacent 3 protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The -NH₂ group is electron-donating.\n*   The -COOCH₂CH₃ group is electron-withdrawing.\n*   Placing these groups in a para arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify the Structure with the Data:**\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. This matches. (Benzene ring C₆H₄ + Amino NH₂ + Ethyl Ester C₃H₅O₂)\n*   **IR:** Has an -NH₂ group (two peaks at 3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) and a conjugated ester C=O (peak at 1720 cm⁻¹). This matches.\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   Ethyl ester protons: -OCH₂CH₃ gives a quartet around 4.5 ppm and a triplet around 1.2 ppm. This matches.\n    *   Amine protons: -NH₂ gives a broad singlet around 4.0 ppm. This matches.\n    *   Aromatic protons: Protons ortho to the donating -NH₂ group are shielded (upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm). Protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded (downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm). This matches perfectly.\n\nThis structure is commonly known as Benzocaine. Comparing our deduced structure to the options provided:\nA) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. Contains an amide, not an ester and a primary amine.\nB) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\nC) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester; the NMR for the ethyl group would show the -CH₂- group at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\nD) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted compound, which would not give two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nBased on the spectroscopic data provided, the unknown compound C9H11NO2 is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Here is a step-by-step analysis that leads to this conclusion:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A calculation reveals a degree of unsaturation of 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for an ester group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe proton NMR data provides detailed information about the structure:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), resulting in a triplet. This is a classic pattern for an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet represents a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). Its downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of an ester, forming an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is a tell-tale sign of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The broadening is due to proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a distinct pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant separation between the signals indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (the -NH2 group) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (the ethyl ester group, -COOCH2CH3). The protons ortho to the amine are shifted upfield (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the ester are shifted downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Potential Structures**\n\nComparing the deduced structural features with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted isomer and an amide, not a primary amine and an ester. Its IR and NMR spectra would not match.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** While it is a 1,4-disubstituted amine, the ester group is different. It would show a propionyl group in the NMR, not an ethyl ester.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data showing a primary amine. It also lacks a primary amine's NMR signal.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence. It is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring containing a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group. The predicted spectral data for this compound aligns precisely with the data provided.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is unambiguously identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is also commonly known as benzocaine.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nMy thinking process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2 is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):** First, I'll calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds. The formula for DBE is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`. For C9H11NO2, this is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (like C=O), which accounts for the fifth.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two medium-to-strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's too high for a simple amide C=O (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is the first part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 hydrogens indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). This is the second part of an ethyl group. The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) means this -CH₂- is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen. Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 hydrogens is characteristic of the protons on a primary amine (-NH₂). Their signal is often broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupole coupling with the nitrogen.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are different electronically, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   From the DBE and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   From the IR and NMR, we have a primary amine (-NH₂) substituent.\n    *   From the IR and NMR, we have an ethyl ester group, specifically -COOCH₂CH₃. The NMR quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the ethyl group is attached to the ester oxygen.\n    *   Putting these pieces together on a 1,4-disubstituted ring gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n5.  **Verify Against Options:**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Wrong substitution pattern (1,3 not 1,4) and it's an amide, not an ester (IR mismatch).\n    *   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all data perfectly. Benzene ring (DBE=4) + ester C=O (DBE=1). Has a -NH₂ group (IR & NMR). Has an ethoxy group -OCH₂CH₃ (NMR t & q). Has a 1,4-disubstituted ring (NMR two doublets).\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Wrong functional group. It's a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is on the wrong side of the ester. This would give an NMR signal for -C(=O)CH₂- at ~2.5 ppm, not an -OCH₂- at 4.5 ppm.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to identify the structure of C9H11NO2.\n    \"\"\"\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    \n    # Data provided\n    ir_data = {\n        \"N-H stretch\": \"3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium-strong)\",\n        \"C=O stretch\": \"1720 cm-1 (strong)\"\n    }\n    \n    nmr_data = {\n        \"1.20 ppm\": \"t, 3H\",\n        \"4.0 ppm\": \"bs, 2H\",\n        \"4.5 ppm\": \"q, 2H\",\n        \"7.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\",\n        \"8.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\"\n    }\n\n    # Choices\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"B\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\",\n        \"C\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"D\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectral data for C9H11NO2:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n    # DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n    dbe = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2\n    print(f\"\\n1.

A secondary amine (-NH-) or secondary amide (-CONH-) would only show one band, and a primary amide (-CONH2) would also show two bands but they often differ in shape and are coupled with a strong amide C=O stretch at a lower frequency.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n    *   This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a double bond or aromatic ring), which usually appears around 1730-1715 cm-1.\n    *   It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which is typically < 1700 cm-1).\n    *   It is generally too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring, e.g., R-COO-Ph), which is typically > 1750 cm-1.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) group and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons, i.e., a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is part of an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons, i.e., a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm is very downfield, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen, specifically in an ester (-COO**CH2**-).\n*   **Combined Analysis of 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm signals:** These two signals together conclusively identify an **ethyl ester** fragment, specifically the -CO**O-CH2-CH3** part.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7-8 ppm):** This region is characteristic of aromatic protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** This means the benzene ring is di-substituted.\n    *   **Splitting (two doublets):** This simple A2B2 (or AA'BB') pattern is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring must be different electronically. One is an electron-donating group (EDG) and the other is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The protons ortho to the EWG are shifted downfield (8.0 ppm), and the protons ortho to the EDG are shifted upfield (7.0 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH, -COOH, or -NH groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH2** group. An amine group is an EDG.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nFrom our analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH2) group (an EDG) attached to the ring.\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group (an EWG) attached to the ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together in a para arrangement gives **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester. The IR and NMR aromatic patterns do not match.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Perfect Match.**\n    *   Formula C9H11NO2 is correct.\n    *   Has a primary amine (-NH2), matching the IR.\n    *   Has a conjugated ethyl ester, matching the C=O at 1720 cm-1 and the ethyl group signals in the NMR (quartet at ~4.5 ppm).\n    *   Is para-disubstituted, matching the two-doublet pattern in the NMR. The -NH2 is the EDG (protons ortho to it are upfield at 7.0 ppm) and -COOEt is the EWG (protons ortho to it are downfield at 8.0 ppm).\n    *   The -NH2 protons appear as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (shows a primary amine) and NMR (-NH- would be 1H, not 2H; a formyl proton -CHO would be present).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The structure is CH3CH2COO-Ph-NH2. This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The C=O stretch would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm-1). In the NMR, the quartet would be from a -CO-CH2- group and appear around 2.5 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAll spectroscopic data points unambiguously to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 typically suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), which is often a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2 group). These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester. An ester group is -C(=O)O-. Conjugation with the benzene ring would lower the frequency from the typical 1735-1750 cm-1 for a saturated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, so it is a methyl group (-CH3). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, so it is a methylene group (-CH2-). The quartet (q) splitting means it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This is consistent with the other part of the -CH2-CH3 fragment. The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-). This confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which aligns perfectly with the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring must be electronically different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing, which causes the large separation in chemical shifts. The amine group (-NH2) is electron-donating, and the ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing. The protons ortho to the donating -NH2 group are shielded and appear upfield (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded and appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting it all together and evaluating the options**\n    The combined spectral data indicates a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, where the substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. It also has a different connectivity.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: primary amine, ethyl ester, and 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted ring, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two doublets.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this isomer, the oxygen is attached to the ring and the carbonyl is attached to the ethyl group (CH3CH2C(=O)O-Ar). The NMR for the alkyl part would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm (-C(=O)-CH2-) and a triplet around 1.1 ppm, which does not match the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the given data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of reference spectra, the correct compound is identified.\n\n### **Analysis of Provided Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group, likely an ester, as it is conjugated with a benzene ring.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet corresponds to a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), which is part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region that integrates to two protons is characteristic of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet represents the methylene group (-CH2-) of an ethyl group that is attached to an oxygen atom (-OCH2CH3). The downfield shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen. This, along with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms an ethyl ester group.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region is a classic sign of a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is due to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group.\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Would show a complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The quartet for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be much further upfield (around 2.2-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Would show only one N-H band in the IR for the secondary amide and would lack the broad 2H signal for a primary amine in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The molecular formula is correct. The IR spectrum is consistent with a primary amine and a conjugated ester. The 1H NMR data perfectly matches the structure, showing an ethyl group, a primary aromatic amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with the expected chemical shifts. This compound is commonly known as benzocaine. Published spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms these assignments.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe spectral data provided is unequivocally consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H)/2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 11)/2 = 10/2 = 5. A value of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree of unsaturation), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of an **ester (C=O)**. This frequency is typical for an ester conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), causing it to be split into a triplet. This is the -CH3 part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3), resulting in a quartet. The significant downfield chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates this methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of the ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)** as part of the ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is characteristic of the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH2)** identified from the IR spectrum. The broadening is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The data points to a molecule containing a para-substituted benzene ring, a primary amine group (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). Assembling these fragments leads to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ester group is incorrect.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: The substitution pattern is meta, not para, and it's an amide, not an ethyl ester.\n*   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A molecule's degree of unsaturation can be calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For C9H11NO2, this is 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5. A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a double bond or aromatic ring).\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents three protons that are split into a triplet. This pattern (a methyl group adjacent to a methylene group) is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH2**CH3**).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for two protons, split into a quartet, corresponds to a methylene group next to a methyl group, confirming the ethyl fragment (-**CH2**CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-**NH2**). The broadness is due to factors like chemical exchange and quadrupolar relaxation. This corroborates the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to two protons, are hallmarks of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH2 group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester group).\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nCombining all the pieces of information:\n*   We have a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a *para* arrangement.\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Comparison with Options\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence. The 1H NMR data from literature for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate shows a triplet around 1.35 ppm, a quartet around 4.31 ppm, a broad singlet for the amine protons, and two doublets in the aromatic region around 6.6 and 7.8 ppm, which is in very good agreement with the provided data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This would be an isomer where the connectivity is different (Ar-O-C(=O)CH2CH3). The 1H NMR would show the -CH2- protons of the propionyl group at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.3-2.6 ppm).\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a *meta*-substituted isomer, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets. It is also a primary amide, not an ester.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H proton in the 1H NMR and a single N-H stretch in the IR spectrum. It also contains a formyl proton (-CHO) signal which is absent in the given data.\n\nTherefore, the data provided conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe formula for the degree of unsaturation is:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nWhere C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, and N = number of nitrogens.\n*   C = 9, H = 11, N = 1\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** These two distinct peaks in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester. The conjugation with a benzene ring slightly lowers the frequency from a simple alkyl ester (~1740 cm⁻¹), making 1720 cm⁻¹ a very reasonable value.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (R-COO-R').\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The neighbors have 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This indicates a -CH₂- group is adjacent.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The neighbors have 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This indicates a -CH₃ group is adjacent.\n    *   **Putting them together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂ group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-COO-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** A broad signal for 2H in this region is very typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and potential hydrogen exchange. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (4H total):** Four protons in the aromatic region, confirming the benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Two doublets, each representing 2 protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The large difference in chemical shifts (7.0 ppm vs. 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The -NH₂ group is a strong donating group, and the ester group (-COOEt) is a withdrawing group. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group are shielded and appear upfield (at 7.0 ppm). The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded and appear downfield (at 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\n*   From the DoU, we have a benzene ring and a C=O double bond.\n*   From IR and NMR, we have a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   From IR and NMR, we have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   From NMR, the benzene ring is para-substituted with the -NH₂ group and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group.\n\nCombining these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the molecular formula:\nBenzene ring (C₆H₄) + Ethyl ester (-COOC₂H₅) + Amine (-NH₂) = C₉H₁₁NO₂. This matches the given formula.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options:**\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- protons would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data and the molecular formula as deduced above.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not an ester, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. Also, the substitution pattern is meta, not para.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the two N-H stretches in the IR spectrum. It would also show a formyl proton signal (~8.2 ppm, singlet) in the ¹H NMR, which is absent.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group, which accounts for 1 DoU).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for an ester (C=O) that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. A non-conjugated ester would be at a slightly higher frequency (~1735-1750 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2), as indicated by the triplet splitting (n+1=3, so n=2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3), as indicated by the quartet splitting (n+1=4, so n=3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) of the methylene group indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2) on an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a clear indication of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n*   **Conclusion and Structure Determination:**\n    *   We have a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n    *   Assembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl portion (CH3CH2CO-), not the alcohol portion. The -CH2- protons would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (not an ester) and the substitution pattern is meta (1,3), which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a systematic analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11 / 2) + (1 / 2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional degree of unsaturation. Given the two oxygen atoms, this is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption band in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is slightly lower than that of a standard saturated ester (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), which indicates that the carbonyl group is **conjugated** with the aromatic ring. This strongly suggests the presence of an **aromatic ester**.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl (-CH₃) group, split by the adjacent two protons of the -CH₂- group.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene (-CH₂-) group, split by the adjacent three protons of the -CH₃ group.\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) signifies that the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester. This confirms the **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)** fragment.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets (d), each representing two protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The large separation in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (pushing its adjacent protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (pulling its adjacent protons downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) represents two exchangeable protons. This signal is characteristic of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** protons, confirming the IR data. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group (an electron-donating group).\n2.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group (an electron-withdrawing group).\n3.  A benzene ring that is 1,4-disubstituted by these two groups.\n\nPlacing the electron-donating amine group and the electron-withdrawing ester group at opposite ends (the 1 and 4 positions) of the benzene ring fits all the data. The protons ortho (next) to the amine are shielded and appear upfield (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the ester group are deshielded and appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\nThe final structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived structure to the options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect functional groups (amide, ether).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect ester type; would give a different NMR signal for the CH₂ group.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all analytical data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect functional groups (amide, ether) and substitution pattern (meta, not para).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    DoU = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n    DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    DoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This eliminates option B, which is a secondary amide (-NH-).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   An **ester** C=O stretch typically appears at 1735-1750 cm⁻¹. Conjugation with a double bond or aromatic ring lowers this frequency to about 1715-1730 cm⁻¹. The value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a conjugated ester.\n    *   An **amide** C=O stretch (Amide I band) is usually found at a lower frequency, around 1630-1680 cm⁻¹. The observed 1720 cm⁻¹ is too high for a typical amide, making options B and D less likely.\n\nBased on the IR data, the compound is likely a primary amine containing a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is the upfield part of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) coupled to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, characteristic of an oxygen in an ester (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, while the upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-donating group. This pattern eliminates option D, which is meta-substituted.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those of an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH) group. Combined with the IR data, this confirms the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n    *   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n    *   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   The electron-donating group is the amine (-NH₂), and the electron-withdrawing group is the ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Placing these at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** (CH₃CH₂COO-C₆H₄-NH₂). This structure has a propionate group. The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would be a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR spectrum (two N-H bands) and the ¹H NMR (-NH₂ signal at 4.0 ppm). This is incorrect.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** (H₂N-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃). This structure has all the identified features: a primary amine, an ethyl ester group, and a para-substituted benzene ring. The spectral data aligns perfectly with this structure.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, which is less likely due to the high C=O frequency in the IR. More importantly, it is a meta-substituted compound, which is inconsistent with the para-substitution pattern (two doublets) seen in the ¹H NMR. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is unequivocally identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct compound.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group C=O) or another ring.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** These two distinct bands in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands arise from the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, this value is characteristic of an α,β-unsaturated ester, such as an ester directly attached to a benzene ring. Saturated esters usually appear at a slightly higher frequency (1735-1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet with an integration of 3H strongly suggests a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2). This is a classic pattern for an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet with an integration of 2H is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2) next to a methyl group (-CH3). The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm indicates that this methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom in an ester linkage (R-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **Combined Analysis of 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm signals:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together are definitive evidence for an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2H is indicative of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of water. The chemical shift around 4.0 ppm is typical for an amino group on an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two doublets arise from the two sets of chemically equivalent aromatic protons. The downfield shift of one doublet (8.0 ppm) is due to the deshielding effect of an electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the upfield shift of the other doublet (7.0 ppm) is due to the shielding effect of an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Pieces and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The molecule has a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   The molecule has an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   The molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** An ethyl group is attached to a carboxylate, which is attached to a benzene ring at position 1. An amino group is at position 4.\n    *   **Matches the data:**\n        *   Formula: C9H11NO2 (Correct)\n        *   IR: Primary -NH2 (two bands around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹) and a conjugated C=O stretch (~1720 cm⁻¹). This is a perfect match.\n        *   ¹H NMR: An ethyl group (triplet and quartet), a primary amine (broad singlet), and two doublets for a para-substituted ring. This also perfectly matches the given data.\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:**\n    *   **Structure:** An ethoxy group and an amide group are in a meta relationship on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Doesn't match:** This is a primary amide (-CONH2), which would also show two N-H bands in the IR. However, the C=O stretch of an amide is typically at a lower frequency (around 1650 cm⁻¹). The NMR would show signals for an ethoxy group, but the aromatic region would be more complex than two doublets, and there would be no separate -NH2 signal in the 4.0 ppm region.\n\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a secondary amide (formamide).\n    *   **Doesn't match:** A secondary amide has only one N-H bond and would therefore show only one N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, not two.\n\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:**\n    *   **Structure:** A propionate group is attached to the oxygen of a phenol, which also has an amino group at the para position. The ester is an aryl ester, not an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Doesn't match:** This structure would not give the characteristic ethyl group signals (triplet and quartet) in the ¹H NMR spectrum. Instead, it would show an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl, resulting in a quartet and a triplet at different chemical shifts.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe data overwhelmingly supports the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The IR and ¹H NMR data are in complete agreement with this structure, including the primary amine, the ethyl ester, and the para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. Spectroscopic data found in the literature for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms this identification.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound C9H11NO2 is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion:\n\n### **1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A calculation reveals 5 degrees of unsaturation, which strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and an additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### **2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Specifically, it matches the frequency for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from that of a simple aliphatic ester.\n\n### **3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H):** This combination is a classic signature for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The quartet's downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene (-CH2) group is attached to an electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen of an ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H):** This broad signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group. The broadness is typical for amine protons due to factors like chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling.\n*   **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two aromatic protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2) are shielded and appear at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm). The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group (-COOEt) are deshielded and appear at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the propionate, not an ethoxy group attached to the carbonyl. Its NMR would show a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the available data:\n    *   It has a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   It has an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   Spectroscopic data found in literature for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms the observed chemical shifts and IR bands.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is unambiguously identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C₉H₁₁NO₂\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A compound with this formula has 5 degrees of unsaturation. This typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, such as a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Analyze the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). Primary amines show two bands for asymmetric and symmetric stretching, while secondary amines show one and tertiary amines show none.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. For an ester conjugated with an aromatic ring, the C=O stretch is expected between 1730-1715 cm⁻¹. This value fits perfectly with a conjugated ester. It is too high for a typical amide (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggest a primary aromatic amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n### 3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet for 3 protons and a quartet for 2 protons is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The quartet's significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, consistent with an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃). A reported spectrum of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate shows this quartet at 4.31 ppm. The value of 4.5 ppm in the problem is reasonably close.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). Its position is consistent with an amino group on an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic effects. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating amino group (-NH₂), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt).\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a *meta*-substituted ring, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. Also, as a primary amide, its C=O IR stretch would be closer to 1650 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a *secondary* amide and would show only one N-H band in the IR spectrum. It also lacks a primary amine group.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has an ester group, but the ethyl part is attached to the carbonyl carbon (CH₃CH₂COO-). The -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would appear around 2.3-2.6 ppm in the NMR spectrum, not at 4.5 ppm. The given spectrum shows an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n*   **D) Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all the data:\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n    *   **IR:** Has a primary amine (-NH₂) showing two N-H bands, and a conjugated ester (-COOEt) showing a C=O band at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Features an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen (quartet ~4.3-4.5 ppm, triplet ~1.2-1.3 ppm), a primary amine (broad singlet ~4.0 ppm), and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with protons deshielded by the ester and shielded by the amine (two doublets ~7.0 and ~8.0 ppm).\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all spectral data, the compound is unequivocally identified as Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which results in a value of 5.\n*   **Significance:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the IR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct bands are the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the N-H bonds. This information rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated ester (Ar-COOR), where conjugation with the aromatic ring lowers the frequency from a typical saturated ester (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹). It is generally too high for an amide (typically <1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is a definitive pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The key is the downfield chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**, which indicates the -CH₂- group is directly attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This single piece of data is sufficient to rule out option (C) `4-aminophenyl propionate`, where the -CH₂- quartet would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂), corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The separation in chemical shifts indicates that the two substituents have different electronic properties: one is electron-donating (-NH₂) and the other is electron-withdrawing (-COOCH₂CH₃). This rules out option (B) `3-ethoxybenzamide`, which is meta-substituted and would show a more complex pattern.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\nAll pieces of spectral data consistently point to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group in a para (1,4) arrangement. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **(A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data.\n*   **(B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect substitution (meta) and functional group (amide).\n*   **(C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect NMR chemical shift for the ethyl group's methylene protons.\n*   **(D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect functional group (secondary amide), which contradicts the IR and NMR evidence for a primary amine.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (C=O or C=C) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric stretches, respectively.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region, indicating a C=O group. This value is typical for a conjugated ester or an aldehyde. Given the DoU calculation, this C=O group likely accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm is quite downfield, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen: an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), most likely as part of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for the exchangeable protons of an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH). Combined with the IR data, this signal confirms the primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group).\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group, -COOEt).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify with the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the NMR would show a quartet for the CH₂ next to the carbonyl at ~2.2-2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern. It is also an amide, and the C=O stretch is usually at a lower frequency.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR and only one N-H proton in the NMR.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified by breaking down the information from each spectrum and comparing it with the proposed structures.\n\n### **Analysis of Provided Data**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated to be 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is typical for an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the interpretation of the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, point to a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure, also known as Benzocaine, has a para-substituted benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂):** Matches.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester. This is consistent with the observed N-H and C=O stretches.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Contains an ethoxy group, a primary amine, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups. This perfectly matches all the observed signals and their splitting patterns.\n\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. While the formula matches, the NMR would show a propionyl group (a triplet and quartet at much higher field, ~1.1 and ~2.5 ppm respectively) instead of an ethoxy group. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure has a primary amide (-CONH₂) and meta-substitution. The IR carbonyl stretch for an amide is typically at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR aromatic region would show a more complex pattern for meta-substitution, not two doublets. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-). It would show only one N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, not two. The NMR would show a signal for only one amide proton, not two, and would also feature a very downfield formyl proton (H-C=O) signal. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral data—molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR—are fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nDBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\nA DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the DBE and the presence of two oxygen atoms, this is very likely an ester group. The frequency is a bit low for a simple alkyl ester, suggesting conjugation with the aromatic ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which aligns with the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule contains:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an ester, but the ethyl group is on the acid side (propionate), not the alcohol side. The NMR would show a -O-C6H4-NH2 pattern, and the propionate group would have different shifts.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H peak in the IR and NMR.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a para-substituted ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the correct chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given Data\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    ir_data = [\"3420 cm-1 (N-H stretch)\", \"3325 cm-1 (N-H stretch)\", \"1720 cm-1 (C=O stretch)\"]\n    nmr_data = {\n        \"1.20 ppm\": \"t, 3H\",\n        \"4.0 ppm\": \"bs, 2H\",\n        \"4.5 ppm\": \"q, 2H\",\n        \"7.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\",\n        \"8.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\"\n    }\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"B\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\",\n        \"C\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"D\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step Analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.

A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation typically corresponds to a double bond, such as a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands in the N-H stretching region is a classic signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out secondary amides (one band) and tertiary amides/amines (no bands in this region).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n    *   This frequency is typical for an **ester group conjugated with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR)**. Simple alkyl esters are usually at a slightly higher frequency (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), but conjugation lowers the frequency.\n    *   It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   It is too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760-1770 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule (n=2) means this methyl group is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Fragment:** -CH₂-CH₃\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule (n=3) means this methylene group is adjacent to the methyl (-CH₃) group identified above.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH₂ group. This high value is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-C(=O)-O-**CH₂**-).\n    *   **Fragment:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons like those on N-H or O-H groups. This signal is consistent with the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Indicates four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (lower ppm). The ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield (higher ppm). Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the structure consists of:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\nAssembling these pieces gives **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine, not amide) and NMR (para substitution pattern).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The IR C=O stretch would also be at a higher frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl group, para-substituted ring, and amine protons in the NMR.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine). It would also show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal in the NMR, which is absent.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O group).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester. It is too high for a simple amide (~1660 cm⁻¹) and in the correct range for an α,β-unsaturated or aryl ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the two substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group (EDG).\n*   The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n*   Placing these on the ring in a para-arrangement: The protons ortho to the donating -NH₂ group will be shielded and appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group will be deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and have an N-H proton integrating to 1H in the NMR. The C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- protons would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with appropriate electronic effects reflected in the NMR chemical shifts. The molecular formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ is also correct.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide, and its C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1660 cm⁻¹). Also, as a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) ring, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1.

The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl).\n\n### 4.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is `(2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2`.\n    *   (2 * 9 + 2 + 1 - 11 - 0) / 2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 11) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5.\n*   A degree of unsaturation of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH2-). This pattern, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is a classic signal for the two protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar relaxation from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, the fragments are:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only structure that fits all the data is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and its NMR spectrum would be different.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl, showing a quartet around 2.3-2.6 ppm, which contradicts the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data: the molecular formula, the IR bands for a primary amine and a conjugated ester, and the ¹H NMR signals for an ethyl ester, a primary aromatic amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide and is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula can be used to calculate the degree of unsaturation, which indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, this is very likely an ester, which usually appears between 1750-1715 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group. This pattern is characteristic of the methyl part of an ethyl group (-CH₂**CH₃**).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons is a quartet (q), meaning it is adjacent to a -CH₃ group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom within an ester (-COO**CH₂**CH₃). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-**NH₂**). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals, both doublets (d) and each integrating to 2 protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts for the aromatic protons mean the two substituents on the ring have different electronic effects. The electron-donating amino group (-NH₂) shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   The molecule contains a **primary amine** (-NH₂).\n*   It contains an **ethyl ester** group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **1,4 (para) arrangement**.\n\nThis information leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and has a secondary amine (N-H), which would show only one IR band.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group is part of the propionate, not the ester's alcohol portion.

Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region is characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester**, specifically an aromatic ester. It is generally too high for an amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents are electronically different. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified from the IR spectrum. Its broadness is due to quadrupole broadening and chemical exchange. The -NH₂ group is an electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is characteristic of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the methyl (-CH₃) protons, which are split by the two adjacent methylene protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks).\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene (-CH₂) protons, which are split by the three adjacent methyl protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks).\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the methylene quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester group (-O-CH₂-).

Also, 1,3-substitution would produce a more complex aromatic NMR pattern.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this ester, the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for this methylene group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and one N-H proton in the NMR. It would also have a formyl proton (-CHO) signal above 8 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1.

Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide N-H stretch is typically at a slightly lower frequency.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide (which is usually < 1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3), such as a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This pattern (a 3H triplet) is classic for the methyl part of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a group with three protons (3+1=4), such as a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**, which is part of an ester.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals for 2H are often due to exchangeable protons, like those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Given the IR data, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield (deshielded) compared to those at 7.0 ppm. This indicates that the ring is substituted with both an electron-donating group (EDG) and an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n        *   The -NH₂ group is a strong EDG, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to ~7.0 ppm).\n        *   The ester group (-COOR) is an EWG, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This compound is also known as Benzocaine.\n\n**5. Verifying the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all spectral data perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The NMR would show a -CO-CH₂- quartet around 2.5 ppm, not a -O-CH₂- quartet at 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR would show one N-H band and an amide C=O band (~1670 cm⁻¹). Incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide and is meta-substituted. The IR C=O band would be incorrect, and the aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex than two doublets. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic spectroscopy problem. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step to deduce the structure of the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nFor C9H11NO2:\n*   C = 9 (carbons)\n*   H = 11 (hydrogens)\n*   N = 1 (nitrogen)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\n**DoU = 5**\n\nA DoU of 4 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring. The additional degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests the presence of one double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is also supported by the IR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show one band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. An amide carbonyl typically appears at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons, indicating a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split by 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This means the -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n    *   This suggests a **-CH₂-CH₃** fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons, indicating a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split by 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This means the -CH₂ group is next to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂ group, which indicates it is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (**-O-CH₂-**).\n    *   Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm, we can confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for protons on heteroatoms that can undergo chemical exchange, such as -OH or -NH protons.\n    *   Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH₂ group**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** This symmetrical pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are further downfield because they are ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing ester group. The protons at 7.0 ppm are more upfield because they are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Final Conclusion**\n\nPutting all the pieces together:\n1.  We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of the acid portion (CH₃CH₂COO-). The NMR for the -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (N-H stretching) is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band corresponds to the asymmetric stretch and the other to the symmetric stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (2+1=3), which is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This is the -CH₃ part of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (3+1=4), which is a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significantly downfield shift for a -CH₂- group. This high value is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom that is part of an ester (-C(=O)-O-**CH₂**-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)** attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester fragment.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of amine protons (-NH₂), which often appear broad due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the primary amine found in the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Indicates four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield), meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (further upfield), meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data. It has the correct formula (C9H11NO2), a primary amine, a conjugated ester, an ethoxy group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with the expected chemical shifts.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester. The C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). The aromatic region would show a more complex pattern for meta-substitution, not two doublets.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. The NMR would show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8 ppm and an N-H proton, not an -NH₂ signal.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The ester group is -O-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at a much lower chemical shift (~2.2-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and IR Spectrum\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal, a triplet integrating to three hydrogens, suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two hydrogens is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂) next to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, such as an oxygen in an ester (-COOCH₂-). Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) attached to an ester oxygen.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two hydrogens is a classic signal for the protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two hydrogens, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-donating amino group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### 3. Structure Determination\n\nBased on the combined data:\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The NMR data confirms a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. The spectroscopic data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate found in literature is consistent with the data provided.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of Other Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amine (would show one N-H band in IR) and an amide, which is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has a propionate group, not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show a methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl around 2.2-2.5 ppm, which is not observed.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, and the aromatic substitution is meta, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR than two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the data uniquely identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated as follows: `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    For C9H11NO2, this is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n    A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the molecular formula and other data, this is consistent with an ester.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding and quadrupolar relaxation. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield doublet (~7.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂), while the downfield doublet (~8.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n    The data points to a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group. Assembling these pieces gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n    Let's check this against the given options:\n    *   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and has a different NMR pattern.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure, also known as Benzocaine, perfectly matches all the data:\n        *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n        *   **IR:** Has a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester carbonyl (C=O).\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Has an ethyl ester group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. Published spectra for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate show signals at approximately 1.35 ppm (t, 3H), 4.16 ppm (s, br, 2H, -NH₂), 4.31 ppm (q, 2H), 6.62 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.84 ppm (d, 2H), which are in excellent agreement with the provided data.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group attached to the phenolic oxygen. The NMR signal for the -CH₂- next to the carbonyl would be much further upfield (around 2.3-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, and the carbonyl IR stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). The aromatic substitution is meta, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe spectroscopic data is unequivocally consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic sign of a primary amine (-NH2). These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, like the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield signal at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Structure Determination\n\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   The formula is C9H11NO2 and the DoU is 5.\n*   The IR spectrum shows a primary amine (-NH2) and a carbonyl group (C=O), likely an ester.\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of an ethyl group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure is a benzene ring substituted with an amino group and an ethyl ester group at positions 1 and 4. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group would be part of the propionate, and its methylene protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl, appearing at a much higher field (around 2.3 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, and its IR C=O stretch would likely be at a lower frequency. It would also show a signal for the formyl proton (H-C=O) in the NMR, which is absent.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) benzene, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This value is characteristic of an ester, which is often found between 1715-1750 cm⁻¹. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests it might be conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. An amide C=O stretch is usually found at a lower frequency (1630-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity means it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) in an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet (q) multiplicity means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (a -CH₃ group). This is the corresponding methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl group. The downfield chemical shift of 4.5 ppm indicates that this -CH₂- group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom in an ester (-COO-CH₂-) or ether (Ar-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. This signal, combined with the IR data, is definitively the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid or water.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets indicates that one substituent is a strong electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), and the other is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n    *   An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)\n    *   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n    *   An ester carbonyl group (C=O)\n*   The -NH₂ group is an EDG, and an ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is an EWG. Placing these two groups in a para (1,4) position on the benzene ring satisfies all the NMR and IR data.\n*   The proposed structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify the Proposed Structure with the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃.\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. Correct.\n    *   **IR:** Contains -NH₂ and a conjugated ester C=O. Correct.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Contains an ethyl group, a para-disubstituted ring with an EDG and EWG, and an -NH₂ group. All chemical shifts and multiplicities match the data. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is CH₃CH₂COO-C₆H₄-NH₂. The CH₂ group would be a quartet around 2.6 ppm (next to C=O), not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets. Also, it is a primary amide, which has a C=O stretch at a lower frequency (~1660 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. It would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and a 1H signal for the N-H proton in the NMR. It would also have a formyl proton (CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2, we must analyze the given spectroscopic data step-by-step.\n\n### Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are highly characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). Primary amines show two bands due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching, whereas secondary amines show only one.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring, which shifts the absorption to a slightly lower wavenumber compared to a saturated ester.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can infer the presence of a primary amine (-NH2) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n### Analysis of the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents three protons, and its triplet (t) splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group. This is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group that is part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for two protons appears as a quartet (q), meaning it is adjacent to a -CH3 group. The significant downfield chemical shift (around 3.5-4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- group is bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. Combined with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethyl ester group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a classic signal for the hydrogens of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to factors like quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. This supports the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets (d) in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The upfield shift to 7.0 ppm is caused by an electron-donating group (the -NH2 group), while the downfield shift to 8.0 ppm is caused by an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOCH2CH3 group).\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nCombining all the pieces of evidence:\n1.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring to which these two groups are attached.\n\nThe structure that fits all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is consistent with this structure. The spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate from literature sources confirms these assignments.\n\nLet's review the other options:\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This would show a more complex pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR (not two doublets) due to meta-substitution. Also, the amide C=O stretch in the IR would typically be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H peak in the IR spectrum. Its ¹H NMR would show a single N-H proton signal and a formyl proton signal.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has a propionate group, not an ethyl ester attached to the ring. The NMR signal for the -CH2- group of the propionate would be a quartet around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not the 4.5 ppm observed, as it would be adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, not the ester oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the data conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    First, I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to get a clue about the structure.\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (which accounts for 1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic sign of a primary amine (-NH2). These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This specific frequency is typical for an ester, which is generally found between 1750-1715 cm-1. It is too high for a simple amide C=O.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The quartet's downfield chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is an oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH2CH3), likely part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The signal is broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shift difference suggests the two substituents have opposing electronic effects. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   From the analysis, we have the following fragments: a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Putting these pieces together gives us ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n    *   Let's check this against the options:\n        *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta, not para) and it's a primary amide, not an ester.\n        *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n        *   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n        *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but it contains a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group. The NMR would be different (the quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm).\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data provided:\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    ir_data = \"medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1; strong band at 1720 cm-1\"\n    nmr_data = \"1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"B\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"C\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\",\n        \"D\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\"\n    }\n\n    # Step-by-step reasoning based on the data\n    analysis = [\n        \"1.

This is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct compound is:\nC) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) or Double Bond Equivalent.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DBE of 5 indicates a high degree of unsaturation. This is very characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE). The additional unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) suggested by the IR data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH2). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. A conjugated ketone would also be in this region, but an ester is more likely given the other data. It is generally too high for a simple amide C=O (usually < 1700 cm-1).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic proton region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The splitting pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The large separation in chemical shifts (7.0 ppm vs 8.0 ppm) means one substituent is a strong electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the adjacent protons and shifts them upfield (to 7.0 ppm). The other is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields its adjacent protons and shifts them downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   This signal represents 3 protons, indicating a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The triplet (t) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This signal represents 2 protons, indicating a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   The quartet (q) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH3 group).\n    *   The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) for the -CH2- group is characteristic of it being attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group, which confirms the IR data.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure**\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  The amine group (-NH2) is an EDG. The ester group (-COOR) is an EWG.\n4.  Attaching these groups to the para positions of the benzene ring gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n5.  This structure is fully consistent with all spectral data. The -NH2 group makes the ortho protons appear upfield at 7.0 ppm, and the -COOEt group makes its ortho protons appear downfield at 8.0 ppm. The ethyl group and amine protons are also perfectly accounted for.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an ester of a phenol. The NMR would show a quartet for a -CH2- group next to a carbonyl, which would be much further upfield (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR and a 1H signal for the amide proton in the NMR. It lacks the 2H signal for a primary amine.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) compound, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. The frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pattern is the unmistakable signal of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃), split by the two adjacent methylene protons.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-), split by the three adjacent methyl protons. The significantly downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an **ethyl ester group (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This signal confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified in the IR spectrum. The protons are exchangeable, causing the signal to broaden.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a clear sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group are shielded and appear upfield (7.0 ppm).\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group are deshielded and appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nPutting all the pieces together:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. Has a secondary amide, not a primary amine.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. Is 1,3-substituted (meta) and a primary amide.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The ethyl group would be part of a propionate (-CO-CH₂CH₃), and its methylene quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly fits all the provided IR and NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectral data, the correct compound is identified by systematically evaluating each option.\n\n### **Analysis of Provided Data**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two distinct bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm-1** is typical for the C=O stretch of a carbonyl group, specifically an aromatic ester.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-). Together, the signals at 1.20 and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)** attached to the carbonyl carbon of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is indicative of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar relaxation from the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield due to the deshielding effect of the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield due to the electron-donating effect of the amino group.\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure, also known as Benzocaine, has a primary amine (-NH2), an ethyl ester group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. This structure perfectly matches all the IR and 1H NMR data, including the chemical formula C9H11NO2.\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This compound is a primary amide, not an ester. The C=O stretch for an amide would be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1), which contradicts the IR band at 1720 cm-1. Also, as a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) benzene, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only a single N-H stretch in the IR spectrum and a 1H signal for the N-H proton in the NMR, contradicting the data indicating a primary amine (-NH2) with two N-H stretches and two protons.\n\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This compound is a phenyl ester with a propionate group (-CO-CH2CH3). The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- group adjacent to the carbonyl at around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. The data clearly shows an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), not a propionate group.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral evidence points unequivocally to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula & Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `(2C + 2 + N - H) / 2 = (2*9 + 2 + 1 - 11) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5`. This value strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and an additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** indicates a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. This frequency is typical for an ester, which is consistent with the presence of two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula. Published data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate show IR absorption bands at 3424 cm-1, 3345 cm-1, and a carbonyl stretch at 1685 cm-1. The provided data is in close agreement.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet, integrating to three protons, is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2) next to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, forming an **ethyl ester (-OCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is indicative of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. The protons are broad due to exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe data pieces together to form a single structure:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR would show a propionate group, not an ethyl ester attached to the oxygen.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This would show a single N-H stretch in the IR for the secondary amide and a formyl proton signal in the NMR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. All spectroscopic data perfectly match this structure. Published 1H NMR data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms the observed chemical shifts: δ 1.36 (t, 3H), 4.04 (br s, 2H), 4.31 (q, 2H), 6.63 (d, 2H), and 7.85 (d, 2H). These values are very close to the data provided in the problem.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide and would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR due to 1,3-substitution.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Here is a detailed breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion.\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A calculation reveals 5 degrees of unsaturation. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically in the range expected for an ester. The value is too high for an amide and fits well for an aromatic ester.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl (-CH3) group that is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2) group, which splits it into a triplet. This is the \"ethyl\" part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H):** This signal is from a methylene (-CH2) group adjacent to a methyl (-CH3) group, resulting in a quartet. Its significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates it is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of the ester group (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to chemical exchange and nitrogen's quadrupolar effects.\n*   **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two doublets, each integrating to two protons, arise from the symmetry of the ring. The protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group are shifted upfield (around 7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group are shifted significantly downfield (around 8.0 ppm).\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- next to the carbonyl group at a much lower chemical shift (~2.3-2.6 ppm).\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show a single N-H band in the IR spectrum and a 1H signal for the amide proton in the NMR, not the two bands and 2H signal for a primary amine.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. All spectroscopic data perfectly match this structure, also known as Benzocaine. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring, consistent with all IR and NMR signals.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. The C=O stretch for an amide is typically at a lower frequency (~1650-1680 cm⁻¹). Also, a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) ring would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThis is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n*   C = 9 (carbon atoms)\n*   H = 11 (hydrogen atoms)\n*   N = 1 (nitrogen atom)\n*   O = 2 (oxygen atoms, which don't affect the calculation)\n*   X = 0 (halogen atoms)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\nA DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 3 for double bonds and 1 for the ring) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other is for the symmetric N-H stretch. This information immediately rules out option D, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is typical for an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. Combined with the DoU calculation, this strongly suggests a structure with a benzene ring and a C=O group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in chemical shift (7.0 vs. 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group, and the ester group (-COOR) is a strong electron-withdrawing group.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is very downfield, which indicates that the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). If it were an ethoxy group attached directly to the ring (-O-CH₂CH₃), the shift would be closer to 4.0 ppm. If it were part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃), the shift would be around 2.5-3.0 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) identified from the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange. Its position is consistent with an amino group attached to an aromatic ring.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options:**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule contains:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's combine these pieces. The two substituents on the benzene ring must be the -NH₂ group and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group. This gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has an NH₂ and a para-substituted ring, but the ester linkage is different (Ar-O-CO-Et). The NMR for the ethyl group would be different (quartet at ~2.5 ppm).\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure (H₂N-Ar-CO-O-Et) perfectly matches all the data. The para-substituted ring with an electron-donating group (NH₂) and an electron-withdrawing group (COOEt) explains the two doublets. The ethyl ester fragment explains the triplet and the highly deshielded quartet. The primary amine explains the two IR bands and the broad NMR singlet.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data (which shows a primary amine).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectral data unequivocally points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 10/2 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2 group). One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other is for the symmetric N-H stretch.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an aryl ester (a C=O group attached to a benzene ring), which are often found around 1715-1730 cm-1. It is too high for a typical amide C=O (usually < 1700 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an ester (-O-CH2CH3) or an ether. Given the IR data, an ethyl ester is the most likely conclusion.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, which often results in a broad signal. The chemical shift is appropriate for an aniline-type amine (an amine attached to a benzene ring).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting the adjacent protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting the adjacent protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  The amine group is electron-donating, and the ester group is electron-withdrawing. This perfectly explains the aromatic proton shifts: the protons next to the donating -NH2 group are at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm), and the protons next to the withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group are at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm).\n    4.  The structure is therefore 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, or **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3). The NMR quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This has an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1. Also, the substitution is meta (1,3), which would not produce two simple doublets in the NMR.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This contains a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular Formula, DoU, IR, and 1H NMR).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** This calculation helps determine the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 π-bonds) plus one additional π-bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the classic signature for the N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would typically show only a single band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption band in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (typically 1730-1715 cm⁻¹). This frequency is too high to be an amide, which usually appears at a lower frequency (<1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's interpret each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH₃). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group (since n+1=3, n=2). This is the start of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The quartet (q) splitting confirms it is adjacent to a methyl group (since n+1=4, n=3). The very downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to the oxygen of an ester (-COO-**CH₂**-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for two protons in this region is characteristic of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and the quadrupolar nature of the nitrogen atom. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region, confirming the benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are shielded (upfield) because they are adjacent to the electron-donating amine group. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded (downfield) because they are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the combined evidence:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow let's check the given options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, inconsistent with both the IR and NMR data.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this structure, the ethyl group would be part of the propionate group (-OCOCH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for that CH₂ group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe user has provided spectral data (IR, 1H NMR) and a molecular formula (C9H11NO2) and asks to identify the correct structure from four options.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    *   The code execution confirms that all four options (A, B, C, D) are isomers with this formula.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group. All options contain a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, so this is consistent.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A primary amide (-CONH2) also shows two bands, but a secondary amide (-NH-) would show only one. This fact makes option A, a secondary amide, highly unlikely.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is for a carbonyl (C=O) group. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. A conjugated amide (like in option C) typically absorbs at a lower frequency (around 1680 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is a definitive signature for an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-O-CH2-CH3)**. The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the -CH3 group, split by the adjacent two protons of the -CH2- group. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the -CH2- group, split by the adjacent three protons of the -CH3 group. The very downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is crucial and confirms the -CH2- is bonded to a highly electronegative oxygen atom.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH2)**, which confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The large separation in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Combined Data:**\n\n    *   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR and the 2H -NH2 signal in the NMR. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n        *   Has a primary amine (-NH2): Matches IR and the 4.0 ppm NMR signal.\n        *   Is an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3): Matches the C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the ethyl group signals (triplet at 1.20 ppm, quartet at 4.5 ppm) in the NMR.\n        *   Is 1,4-disubstituted: Matches the two-doublet pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR. The electron-donating -NH2 and electron-withdrawing -COOEt groups explain the large chemical shift difference.\n        *   **This structure is a perfect match for all the data.**\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets. Also, the C=O is an amide, which is a poorer fit for the 1720 cm⁻¹ IR band. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group in this structure is part of a propionate group (-O-CO-CH2CH3). The -CH2- group is adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear as a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm in the NMR, not at 4.5 ppm. **Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only structure that is fully consistent with all the provided spectral data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Here is a breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion:\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, such as a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, specifically in the range for an ester.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic pattern for a para- (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The significant difference in chemical shift between the two doublets suggests one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the protons, moving them upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the protons, moving them downfield to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group (-NH₂) is donating, and the ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is withdrawing, which perfectly fits this observation.\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):**\n    *   The triplet at **1.20 ppm (3H)** corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   The quartet at **4.5 ppm (2H)** corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group. The downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is indicative of the methylene group being attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, confirming the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) as part of an ester.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** The broad singlet at **4.0 ppm integrating to 2H** is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom.\n\n### Conclusion by Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure contains a para-substituted benzene ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group. All features perfectly match the IR and ¹H NMR data. Spectroscopic data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as Benzocaine) confirms these spectral features.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and one N-H proton in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR, not two clean doublets.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this isomer, the quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl, shifting its signal to a much more upfield position (around 2.2-2.6 ppm), which contradicts the observed shift at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, all the provided evidence points unequivocally to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a clear indication of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is typical for an ester.\n\nCombining these observations, the compound is likely a primary amine containing an ester group.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The molecular formula C9H11NO2 has a degree of unsaturation of 5. (Calculated as: 9 - 11/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 5). A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for one, which fits the data.\n\n*   **Signal-by-Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet and integrates to three protons. This pattern is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet and integrates to two protons. This is typical for a methylene group (-CH₂) next to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift of ~4.5 ppm indicates that this methylene group is attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH₂-). Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are both doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons. This pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is due to protons adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n### Structure Determination and Evaluation of Options\n\nAssembling the identified fragments—a primary amine, an ethoxy group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring—leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data analyzed. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. The predicted chemical shifts and IR frequencies match the provided data.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amine (an amide), which would show only a single N-H stretch in the IR, and its C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency. This contradicts the IR data.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has a propionyloxy group (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃), not an ethoxy group. The methylene protons of the propionyl group would appear as a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide with a 1,3- (meta) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The NMR would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the data unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo identify the compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2, we must analyze the provided spectroscopic data and compare it with the proposed structures.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):** The first step is to calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is ((2 * 9 + 2) - 11 + 1) / 2 = 5. The presence of a benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for the fifth. This suggests the presence of a substituted benzene ring containing a carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two medium to strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration, likely from an ester group, which typically appears in the 1750-1700 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a classic sign of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is a very common signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons, coupled with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester linkage (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The difference in chemical shifts suggests one substituent is electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the propionate, not the alcohol portion. Its -CH₂- signal in the NMR would be around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure has a meta-substituted ring, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets. Also, the carbonyl stretch for an amide is typically at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is consistent with all the data.\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2.\n    *   **IR:** It has a primary amine (-NH₂) for the 3420/3325 cm⁻¹ bands and an ester carbonyl for the 1720 cm⁻¹ band.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It contains an ethyl ester group, which accounts for the triplet at ~1.3 ppm and the quartet at ~4.3 ppm. It has a primary amine (-NH₂) that would show as a broad singlet around 4.0-4.2 ppm. The para-substituted ring with an electron-donating amine and an electron-withdrawing ester group explains the two doublets in the aromatic region. The reference spectra for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirm these assignments.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR spectrum would show only one N-H stretch, not two. The NMR would show a signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) at around 8.0-8.5 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combination of a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring perfectly matches the provided spectral data. Therefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   DoU = C - H/2 - N/2 + 1\n*   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O), which accounts for the fifth degree.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH₂ group), corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester or an aldehyde/ketone. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, an ester is highly likely.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets implies that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding the ortho protons, causing an upfield shift to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons, causing a downfield shift to ~8.0 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum. Its position is consistent with an amine attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals (a triplet and a quartet) is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) protons are split into a **triplet** by the adjacent 2 protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The methylene group (-CH₂) protons are split into a **quartet** by the adjacent 3 protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The -NH₂ group is electron-donating.\n*   The -COOCH₂CH₃ group is electron-withdrawing.\n*   Placing these groups in a para arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify the Structure with the Data:**\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. This matches. (Benzene ring C₆H₄ + Amino NH₂ + Ethyl Ester C₃H₅O₂)\n*   **IR:** Has an -NH₂ group (two peaks at 3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) and a conjugated ester C=O (peak at 1720 cm⁻¹). This matches.\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   Ethyl ester protons: -OCH₂CH₃ gives a quartet around 4.5 ppm and a triplet around 1.2 ppm. This matches.\n    *   Amine protons: -NH₂ gives a broad singlet around 4.0 ppm. This matches.\n    *   Aromatic protons: Protons ortho to the donating -NH₂ group are shielded (upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm). Protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded (downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm). This matches perfectly.\n\nThis structure is commonly known as Benzocaine. Comparing our deduced structure to the options provided:\nA) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. Contains an amide, not an ester and a primary amine.\nB) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\nC) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester; the NMR for the ethyl group would show the -CH₂- group at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\nD) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted compound, which would not give two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nBased on the spectroscopic data provided, the unknown compound C9H11NO2 is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Here is a step-by-step analysis that leads to this conclusion:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A calculation reveals a degree of unsaturation of 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for an ester group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe proton NMR data provides detailed information about the structure:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), resulting in a triplet. This is a classic pattern for an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet represents a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). Its downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of an ester, forming an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is a tell-tale sign of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The broadening is due to proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a distinct pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant separation between the signals indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (the -NH2 group) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (the ethyl ester group, -COOCH2CH3). The protons ortho to the amine are shifted upfield (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the ester are shifted downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Potential Structures**\n\nComparing the deduced structural features with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted isomer and an amide, not a primary amine and an ester. Its IR and NMR spectra would not match.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** While it is a 1,4-disubstituted amine, the ester group is different. It would show a propionyl group in the NMR, not an ethyl ester.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data showing a primary amine. It also lacks a primary amine's NMR signal.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence. It is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring containing a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group. The predicted spectral data for this compound aligns precisely with the data provided.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is unambiguously identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is also commonly known as benzocaine.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nMy thinking process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2 is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):** First, I'll calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds. The formula for DBE is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`. For C9H11NO2, this is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (like C=O), which accounts for the fifth.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two medium-to-strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's too high for a simple amide C=O (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is the first part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 hydrogens indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). This is the second part of an ethyl group. The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) means this -CH₂- is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen. Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 hydrogens is characteristic of the protons on a primary amine (-NH₂). Their signal is often broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupole coupling with the nitrogen.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are different electronically, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   From the DBE and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   From the IR and NMR, we have a primary amine (-NH₂) substituent.\n    *   From the IR and NMR, we have an ethyl ester group, specifically -COOCH₂CH₃. The NMR quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the ethyl group is attached to the ester oxygen.\n    *   Putting these pieces together on a 1,4-disubstituted ring gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n5.  **Verify Against Options:**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Wrong substitution pattern (1,3 not 1,4) and it's an amide, not an ester (IR mismatch).\n    *   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all data perfectly. Benzene ring (DBE=4) + ester C=O (DBE=1). Has a -NH₂ group (IR & NMR). Has an ethoxy group -OCH₂CH₃ (NMR t & q). Has a 1,4-disubstituted ring (NMR two doublets).\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Wrong functional group. It's a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is on the wrong side of the ester. This would give an NMR signal for -C(=O)CH₂- at ~2.5 ppm, not an -OCH₂- at 4.5 ppm.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to identify the structure of C9H11NO2.\n    \"\"\"\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    \n    # Data provided\n    ir_data = {\n        \"N-H stretch\": \"3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium-strong)\",\n        \"C=O stretch\": \"1720 cm-1 (strong)\"\n    }\n    \n    nmr_data = {\n        \"1.20 ppm\": \"t, 3H\",\n        \"4.0 ppm\": \"bs, 2H\",\n        \"4.5 ppm\": \"q, 2H\",\n        \"7.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\",\n        \"8.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\"\n    }\n\n    # Choices\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"B\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\",\n        \"C\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"D\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectral data for C9H11NO2:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n    # DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n    dbe = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2\n    print(f\"\\n1.

A secondary amine (-NH-) or secondary amide (-CONH-) would only show one band, and a primary amide (-CONH2) would also show two bands but they often differ in shape and are coupled with a strong amide C=O stretch at a lower frequency.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n    *   This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a double bond or aromatic ring), which usually appears around 1730-1715 cm-1.\n    *   It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which is typically < 1700 cm-1).\n    *   It is generally too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring, e.g., R-COO-Ph), which is typically > 1750 cm-1.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) group and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons, i.e., a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is part of an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons, i.e., a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm is very downfield, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen, specifically in an ester (-COO**CH2**-).\n*   **Combined Analysis of 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm signals:** These two signals together conclusively identify an **ethyl ester** fragment, specifically the -CO**O-CH2-CH3** part.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7-8 ppm):** This region is characteristic of aromatic protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** This means the benzene ring is di-substituted.\n    *   **Splitting (two doublets):** This simple A2B2 (or AA'BB') pattern is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring must be different electronically. One is an electron-donating group (EDG) and the other is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The protons ortho to the EWG are shifted downfield (8.0 ppm), and the protons ortho to the EDG are shifted upfield (7.0 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH, -COOH, or -NH groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH2** group. An amine group is an EDG.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nFrom our analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH2) group (an EDG) attached to the ring.\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group (an EWG) attached to the ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together in a para arrangement gives **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester. The IR and NMR aromatic patterns do not match.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Perfect Match.**\n    *   Formula C9H11NO2 is correct.\n    *   Has a primary amine (-NH2), matching the IR.\n    *   Has a conjugated ethyl ester, matching the C=O at 1720 cm-1 and the ethyl group signals in the NMR (quartet at ~4.5 ppm).\n    *   Is para-disubstituted, matching the two-doublet pattern in the NMR. The -NH2 is the EDG (protons ortho to it are upfield at 7.0 ppm) and -COOEt is the EWG (protons ortho to it are downfield at 8.0 ppm).\n    *   The -NH2 protons appear as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (shows a primary amine) and NMR (-NH- would be 1H, not 2H; a formyl proton -CHO would be present).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The structure is CH3CH2COO-Ph-NH2. This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The C=O stretch would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm-1). In the NMR, the quartet would be from a -CO-CH2- group and appear around 2.5 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAll spectroscopic data points unambiguously to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 typically suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), which is often a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2 group). These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester. An ester group is -C(=O)O-. Conjugation with the benzene ring would lower the frequency from the typical 1735-1750 cm-1 for a saturated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, so it is a methyl group (-CH3). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, so it is a methylene group (-CH2-). The quartet (q) splitting means it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This is consistent with the other part of the -CH2-CH3 fragment. The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-). This confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which aligns perfectly with the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring must be electronically different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing, which causes the large separation in chemical shifts. The amine group (-NH2) is electron-donating, and the ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing. The protons ortho to the donating -NH2 group are shielded and appear upfield (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded and appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting it all together and evaluating the options**\n    The combined spectral data indicates a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, where the substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. It also has a different connectivity.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: primary amine, ethyl ester, and 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted ring, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two doublets.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this isomer, the oxygen is attached to the ring and the carbonyl is attached to the ethyl group (CH3CH2C(=O)O-Ar). The NMR for the alkyl part would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm (-C(=O)-CH2-) and a triplet around 1.1 ppm, which does not match the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the given data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of reference spectra, the correct compound is identified.\n\n### **Analysis of Provided Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group, likely an ester, as it is conjugated with a benzene ring.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet corresponds to a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), which is part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region that integrates to two protons is characteristic of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet represents the methylene group (-CH2-) of an ethyl group that is attached to an oxygen atom (-OCH2CH3). The downfield shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen. This, along with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms an ethyl ester group.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region is a classic sign of a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is due to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group.\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Would show a complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The quartet for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be much further upfield (around 2.2-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Would show only one N-H band in the IR for the secondary amide and would lack the broad 2H signal for a primary amine in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The molecular formula is correct. The IR spectrum is consistent with a primary amine and a conjugated ester. The 1H NMR data perfectly matches the structure, showing an ethyl group, a primary aromatic amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with the expected chemical shifts. This compound is commonly known as benzocaine. Published spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms these assignments.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe spectral data provided is unequivocally consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H)/2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 11)/2 = 10/2 = 5. A value of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree of unsaturation), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of an **ester (C=O)**. This frequency is typical for an ester conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), causing it to be split into a triplet. This is the -CH3 part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3), resulting in a quartet. The significant downfield chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates this methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of the ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)** as part of the ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is characteristic of the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH2)** identified from the IR spectrum. The broadening is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The data points to a molecule containing a para-substituted benzene ring, a primary amine group (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). Assembling these fragments leads to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ester group is incorrect.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: The substitution pattern is meta, not para, and it's an amide, not an ethyl ester.\n*   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A molecule's degree of unsaturation can be calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For C9H11NO2, this is 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5. A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a double bond or aromatic ring).\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents three protons that are split into a triplet. This pattern (a methyl group adjacent to a methylene group) is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH2**CH3**).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for two protons, split into a quartet, corresponds to a methylene group next to a methyl group, confirming the ethyl fragment (-**CH2**CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-**NH2**). The broadness is due to factors like chemical exchange and quadrupolar relaxation. This corroborates the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to two protons, are hallmarks of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH2 group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester group).\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nCombining all the pieces of information:\n*   We have a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a *para* arrangement.\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Comparison with Options\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence. The 1H NMR data from literature for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate shows a triplet around 1.35 ppm, a quartet around 4.31 ppm, a broad singlet for the amine protons, and two doublets in the aromatic region around 6.6 and 7.8 ppm, which is in very good agreement with the provided data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This would be an isomer where the connectivity is different (Ar-O-C(=O)CH2CH3). The 1H NMR would show the -CH2- protons of the propionyl group at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.3-2.6 ppm).\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a *meta*-substituted isomer, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets. It is also a primary amide, not an ester.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H proton in the 1H NMR and a single N-H stretch in the IR spectrum. It also contains a formyl proton (-CHO) signal which is absent in the given data.\n\nTherefore, the data provided conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe formula for the degree of unsaturation is:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nWhere C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, and N = number of nitrogens.\n*   C = 9, H = 11, N = 1\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** These two distinct peaks in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester. The conjugation with a benzene ring slightly lowers the frequency from a simple alkyl ester (~1740 cm⁻¹), making 1720 cm⁻¹ a very reasonable value.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (R-COO-R').\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The neighbors have 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This indicates a -CH₂- group is adjacent.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The neighbors have 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This indicates a -CH₃ group is adjacent.\n    *   **Putting them together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂ group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-COO-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** A broad signal for 2H in this region is very typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and potential hydrogen exchange. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (4H total):** Four protons in the aromatic region, confirming the benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Two doublets, each representing 2 protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The large difference in chemical shifts (7.0 ppm vs. 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The -NH₂ group is a strong donating group, and the ester group (-COOEt) is a withdrawing group. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group are shielded and appear upfield (at 7.0 ppm). The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded and appear downfield (at 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\n*   From the DoU, we have a benzene ring and a C=O double bond.\n*   From IR and NMR, we have a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   From IR and NMR, we have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   From NMR, the benzene ring is para-substituted with the -NH₂ group and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group.\n\nCombining these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the molecular formula:\nBenzene ring (C₆H₄) + Ethyl ester (-COOC₂H₅) + Amine (-NH₂) = C₉H₁₁NO₂. This matches the given formula.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options:**\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- protons would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data and the molecular formula as deduced above.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not an ester, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. Also, the substitution pattern is meta, not para.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the two N-H stretches in the IR spectrum. It would also show a formyl proton signal (~8.2 ppm, singlet) in the ¹H NMR, which is absent.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group, which accounts for 1 DoU).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for an ester (C=O) that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. A non-conjugated ester would be at a slightly higher frequency (~1735-1750 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2), as indicated by the triplet splitting (n+1=3, so n=2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3), as indicated by the quartet splitting (n+1=4, so n=3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) of the methylene group indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2) on an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a clear indication of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n*   **Conclusion and Structure Determination:**\n    *   We have a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n    *   Assembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl portion (CH3CH2CO-), not the alcohol portion. The -CH2- protons would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (not an ester) and the substitution pattern is meta (1,3), which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a systematic analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11 / 2) + (1 / 2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional degree of unsaturation. Given the two oxygen atoms, this is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption band in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is slightly lower than that of a standard saturated ester (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), which indicates that the carbonyl group is **conjugated** with the aromatic ring. This strongly suggests the presence of an **aromatic ester**.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl (-CH₃) group, split by the adjacent two protons of the -CH₂- group.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene (-CH₂-) group, split by the adjacent three protons of the -CH₃ group.\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) signifies that the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester. This confirms the **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)** fragment.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets (d), each representing two protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The large separation in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (pushing its adjacent protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (pulling its adjacent protons downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) represents two exchangeable protons. This signal is characteristic of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** protons, confirming the IR data. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group (an electron-donating group).\n2.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group (an electron-withdrawing group).\n3.  A benzene ring that is 1,4-disubstituted by these two groups.\n\nPlacing the electron-donating amine group and the electron-withdrawing ester group at opposite ends (the 1 and 4 positions) of the benzene ring fits all the data. The protons ortho (next) to the amine are shielded and appear upfield (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the ester group are deshielded and appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\nThe final structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived structure to the options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect functional groups (amide, ether).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect ester type; would give a different NMR signal for the CH₂ group.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all analytical data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect functional groups (amide, ether) and substitution pattern (meta, not para).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    DoU = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n    DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    DoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This eliminates option B, which is a secondary amide (-NH-).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   An **ester** C=O stretch typically appears at 1735-1750 cm⁻¹. Conjugation with a double bond or aromatic ring lowers this frequency to about 1715-1730 cm⁻¹. The value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a conjugated ester.\n    *   An **amide** C=O stretch (Amide I band) is usually found at a lower frequency, around 1630-1680 cm⁻¹. The observed 1720 cm⁻¹ is too high for a typical amide, making options B and D less likely.\n\nBased on the IR data, the compound is likely a primary amine containing a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is the upfield part of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) coupled to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, characteristic of an oxygen in an ester (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, while the upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-donating group. This pattern eliminates option D, which is meta-substituted.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those of an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH) group. Combined with the IR data, this confirms the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n    *   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n    *   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   The electron-donating group is the amine (-NH₂), and the electron-withdrawing group is the ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Placing these at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** (CH₃CH₂COO-C₆H₄-NH₂). This structure has a propionate group. The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would be a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR spectrum (two N-H bands) and the ¹H NMR (-NH₂ signal at 4.0 ppm). This is incorrect.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** (H₂N-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃). This structure has all the identified features: a primary amine, an ethyl ester group, and a para-substituted benzene ring. The spectral data aligns perfectly with this structure.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, which is less likely due to the high C=O frequency in the IR. More importantly, it is a meta-substituted compound, which is inconsistent with the para-substitution pattern (two doublets) seen in the ¹H NMR. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is unequivocally identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct compound.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group C=O) or another ring.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** These two distinct bands in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands arise from the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, this value is characteristic of an α,β-unsaturated ester, such as an ester directly attached to a benzene ring. Saturated esters usually appear at a slightly higher frequency (1735-1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet with an integration of 3H strongly suggests a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2). This is a classic pattern for an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet with an integration of 2H is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2) next to a methyl group (-CH3). The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm indicates that this methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom in an ester linkage (R-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **Combined Analysis of 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm signals:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together are definitive evidence for an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2H is indicative of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of water. The chemical shift around 4.0 ppm is typical for an amino group on an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two doublets arise from the two sets of chemically equivalent aromatic protons. The downfield shift of one doublet (8.0 ppm) is due to the deshielding effect of an electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the upfield shift of the other doublet (7.0 ppm) is due to the shielding effect of an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Pieces and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The molecule has a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   The molecule has an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   The molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** An ethyl group is attached to a carboxylate, which is attached to a benzene ring at position 1. An amino group is at position 4.\n    *   **Matches the data:**\n        *   Formula: C9H11NO2 (Correct)\n        *   IR: Primary -NH2 (two bands around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹) and a conjugated C=O stretch (~1720 cm⁻¹). This is a perfect match.\n        *   ¹H NMR: An ethyl group (triplet and quartet), a primary amine (broad singlet), and two doublets for a para-substituted ring. This also perfectly matches the given data.\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:**\n    *   **Structure:** An ethoxy group and an amide group are in a meta relationship on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Doesn't match:** This is a primary amide (-CONH2), which would also show two N-H bands in the IR. However, the C=O stretch of an amide is typically at a lower frequency (around 1650 cm⁻¹). The NMR would show signals for an ethoxy group, but the aromatic region would be more complex than two doublets, and there would be no separate -NH2 signal in the 4.0 ppm region.\n\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a secondary amide (formamide).\n    *   **Doesn't match:** A secondary amide has only one N-H bond and would therefore show only one N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, not two.\n\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:**\n    *   **Structure:** A propionate group is attached to the oxygen of a phenol, which also has an amino group at the para position. The ester is an aryl ester, not an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Doesn't match:** This structure would not give the characteristic ethyl group signals (triplet and quartet) in the ¹H NMR spectrum. Instead, it would show an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl, resulting in a quartet and a triplet at different chemical shifts.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe data overwhelmingly supports the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The IR and ¹H NMR data are in complete agreement with this structure, including the primary amine, the ethyl ester, and the para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. Spectroscopic data found in the literature for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms this identification.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound C9H11NO2 is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion:\n\n### **1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A calculation reveals 5 degrees of unsaturation, which strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and an additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### **2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Specifically, it matches the frequency for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from that of a simple aliphatic ester.\n\n### **3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H):** This combination is a classic signature for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The quartet's downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene (-CH2) group is attached to an electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen of an ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H):** This broad signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group. The broadness is typical for amine protons due to factors like chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling.\n*   **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two aromatic protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2) are shielded and appear at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm). The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group (-COOEt) are deshielded and appear at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the propionate, not an ethoxy group attached to the carbonyl. Its NMR would show a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the available data:\n    *   It has a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   It has an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   Spectroscopic data found in literature for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms the observed chemical shifts and IR bands.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is unambiguously identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C₉H₁₁NO₂\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A compound with this formula has 5 degrees of unsaturation. This typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, such as a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Analyze the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). Primary amines show two bands for asymmetric and symmetric stretching, while secondary amines show one and tertiary amines show none.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. For an ester conjugated with an aromatic ring, the C=O stretch is expected between 1730-1715 cm⁻¹. This value fits perfectly with a conjugated ester. It is too high for a typical amide (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggest a primary aromatic amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n### 3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet for 3 protons and a quartet for 2 protons is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The quartet's significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, consistent with an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃). A reported spectrum of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate shows this quartet at 4.31 ppm. The value of 4.5 ppm in the problem is reasonably close.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). Its position is consistent with an amino group on an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic effects. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating amino group (-NH₂), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt).\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a *meta*-substituted ring, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. Also, as a primary amide, its C=O IR stretch would be closer to 1650 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a *secondary* amide and would show only one N-H band in the IR spectrum. It also lacks a primary amine group.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has an ester group, but the ethyl part is attached to the carbonyl carbon (CH₃CH₂COO-). The -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would appear around 2.3-2.6 ppm in the NMR spectrum, not at 4.5 ppm. The given spectrum shows an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n*   **D) Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all the data:\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n    *   **IR:** Has a primary amine (-NH₂) showing two N-H bands, and a conjugated ester (-COOEt) showing a C=O band at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Features an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen (quartet ~4.3-4.5 ppm, triplet ~1.2-1.3 ppm), a primary amine (broad singlet ~4.0 ppm), and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with protons deshielded by the ester and shielded by the amine (two doublets ~7.0 and ~8.0 ppm).\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all spectral data, the compound is unequivocally identified as Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
