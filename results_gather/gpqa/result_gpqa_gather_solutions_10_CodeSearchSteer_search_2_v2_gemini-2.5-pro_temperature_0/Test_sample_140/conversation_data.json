Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n\nThe reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base. The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton (H⁺) from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C6, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   This forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n       (Conceptual diagram)\n    Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene -> Intermediate 1: 3-deuterobenzyne\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower but still possible.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C2, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   This forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n      (Conceptual diagram)\n    Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene -> Intermediate 2: Benzyne\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), will now attack the triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2.\n    *   The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond:\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway A leads to two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    *   The amide ion attacks one of the carbons of the triple bond (e.g., C1), forming a carbanion at the other (C2).\n    *   Protonation of the carbanion by NH₃ gives the final product.\n    *   Since there is no deuterium in this intermediate and the proton source is NH₃, the product is simply **aniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway B leads to one product: aniline.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we get three unique organic products:\n1.  Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (o-deuteroaniline)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (m-deuteroaniline)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Reactant and Potential Abstraction Sites:** The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The bromine is at the C1 position, and a deuterium atom is at the C2 position. The positions ortho to the bromine are C2 (which has a deuterium, D) and C6 (which has a hydrogen, H).\n\n2.  **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond. Consequently, the amide base will abstract the proton from the C6 position more readily than the deuteron from the C2 position. This phenomenon is known as a primary kinetic isotope effect. However, both abstractions are possible.\n\n3.  **Pathway 1: Abstraction of Hydrogen (Major Pathway):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C6.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   The nucleophilic amide ion (NH2-) can then attack either carbon of the benzyne triple bond:\n        *   **Attack at C1:** This leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline** (m-deuterioaniline) after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline** (o-deuterioaniline) after protonation.\n\n4.  **Pathway 2: Abstraction of Deuterium (Minor Pathway):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower due to the kinetic isotope effect but still occurs.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C2, which eliminates the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   In this process, the deuterium is removed. The intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   The nucleophilic amide ion attacks this benzyne, which, after protonation, yields a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nSince both pathways are possible, three distinct organic products can be formed from the reaction.\n\nThe possible products are:\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n*   Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction is between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Benzyne Formation):** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine atom.\n    *   The starting material has two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C6 (with a hydrogen, H) and C2 (with a deuterium, D).\n    *   **Pathway A:** The base abstracts the proton from C6. This is generally faster because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. This elimination forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2.\n    *   **Pathway B:** The base abstracts the deuteron from C2. This elimination forms a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):** The nucleophile, amide ion (NH2-), attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Products from Pathway A's Intermediate (Benzyne C1-C6, D at C2):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The NH2 group adds to C1. Subsequent protonation by ammonia adds an H to C6. The final product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6: The NH2 group adds to C6. Subsequent protonation adds an H to C1. The final product, when numbered with the NH2 group at position 1, is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   This pathway yields **two** distinct products.\n    *   **Products from Pathway B's Intermediate (Benzyne C1-C2, no D):**\n        *   Attack at C1 or C2: The NH2 group adds to either carbon of the triple bond. In both cases, after protonation, the final product is simply **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   This pathway yields **one** distinct product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition products, we find a total of three unique organic products: 2-deuterioaniline, 3-deuterioaniline, and aniline.\n\n```python\n# This problem involves an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the possible benzyne intermediates.\n# The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. The positions ortho to the bromine are C2 (bearing a D) and C6 (bearing an H).\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (C-H bonds are weaker and break more easily than C-D bonds).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at position C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  Although slower, the amide ion can also remove the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is simply **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**Step 3: The Addition Step - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields **2-deuteroaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2).\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields **3-deuteroaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the NH2 group position 1, the D is at position 3).\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Path B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by NH2⁻ at C1 or C2 leads to the same result after protonation.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 (or C2):** The NH2⁻ attacks one carbon of the triple bond, and the other carbon becomes a carbanion, which is then protonated by NH3. The resulting product has no deuterium and is simply **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: List All Possible Products**\nBased on the analysis of the two reaction pathways, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nThese three molecules are isotopomers and are chemically distinct. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) means that Path A (H-abstraction) is faster than Path B (D-abstraction). This affects the relative amounts of the products, but the question asks for the *number* of possible products, so we must consider all possible, even minor, pathways.\n*   The nucleophilic addition to the unsymmetrical 3-deuterobenzyne occurs at both possible sites (C1 and C6), leading to two different products.\n*   The final protonation step uses a proton (H) from the solvent (NH3), not a deuteron.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction produces three different organic molecules: aniline, 2-deuteroaniline, and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type**\n    The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in a suitable solvent (liquid ammonia). These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at position C1. The ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The base can abstract a proton from either of these positions, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:** The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. Simultaneously, the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. This intermediate is called 3-deuterobenzyne.\n        (Note: Abstraction of H is kinetically faster than abstraction of D due to the kinetic isotope effect, so this is the major pathway, but the question asks for all *possible* products).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:** The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. This benzyne intermediate has no deuterium atoms; it is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne.\n\n*   **Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. The relative positions of -NH2 and -D are meta (1,3). This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n        3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Whether the NH2⁻ attacks C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which contains no deuterium.\n\n*   **Step 4: Count the Distinct Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline\n    3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible organic products can be determined by analyzing the steps of the mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, a C-H bond is broken more easily and quickly than a C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains, resulting in **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking either carbon of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne intermediate leads to the formation of a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the possible products from both pathways, we find three distinct organic molecules:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible organic products can be determined by analyzing the formation of the intermediate and the subsequent nucleophilic attack.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Path A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can abstract a hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect). This elimination of HBr results in the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**, an intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remaining at C2.\n    *   **Path B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also abstract the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This pathway is slower but still possible. The elimination of DBr results in the formation of a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):** The nucleophile (NH2-) can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Path B):** The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate. Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, the attack results in a single product: **aniline**.\n\nTherefore, three distinct organic products are possible from this reaction: aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C-6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium remains at C-2.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuterium from C-2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a different benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2.\n\nIt is worth noting that due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily than the C-D bond, so Pathway A is faster. However, both pathways are possible and lead to two different, isomeric benzyne intermediates.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide anion (NH₂⁻), then attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. The attack can occur at either carbon of the strained triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia.\n\n**Analysis of Products from Benzyne A (triple bond C1-C6):**\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-1. The resulting anion at C-6 is protonated by ammonia. The final product is aniline with the deuterium at C-2, which is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-6. The resulting anion at C-1 is protonated. The final product is again **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\nTherefore, Benzyne A leads to only one product: 2-deuterioaniline.\n\n**Analysis of Products from Benzyne B (triple bond C1-C2):**\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-1. The anion forms at C-2 (the carbon with the deuterium). Protonation by ammonia yields aniline with the amino group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-2:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-2. The anion forms at C-1. Protonation by ammonia yields aniline with the amino group at C-2 and the deuterium still at C-2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the attack on Benzyne B.\n*   Attack at C-1 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-1 and D at C-2. This is 2-deuterioaniline.\n*   Attack at C-2 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-2 and an anion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-2 and D at C-3 (relative to the new amino group). This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nLet's trace the positions carefully for the second case (attack at C-2 of Benzyne B):\n1.  Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene.\n2.  Benzyne B formation: Remove D from C-2 and Br from C-1. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. The other ring positions (C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6) have hydrogens.\n3.  Nucleophilic attack: NH₂⁻ attacks C-2. An anion forms at C-1.\n4.  Protonation: The anion at C-1 is protonated by NH₃.\n5.  Final Product: The -NH₂ group is on C-2. The original C-3 is now meta to the amino group. The original C-1 is now ortho to the amino group. Since no deuterium was on C-3, this product is **3-aminobenzene-d1**, which is **m-deuterioaniline** or **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nTherefore, the possible products are:\n*   From Benzyne A: 2-deuterioaniline\n*   From Benzyne B: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline\n\nCombining these, there are two unique possible organic products: **2-deuterioaniline** and **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nThe correct count of possible organic products is 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

One intermediate (benzyne) yields one product (aniline). The other, unsymmetrical intermediate (2-deuterobenzyne) yields two different constitutional isomers (2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline).\n\n    Therefore, the total number of possible organic products is three:\n    1.

Let's analyze the reaction step-by-step to determine all possible products.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe reagent, sodium amide (NaNH₂), is a very strong base. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) will abstract a proton from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of the proton (H⁺) from C6 is faster and represents the major pathway. However, the abstraction of the deuteron (D⁺) from C2 is also possible and occurs as a minor pathway. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion then expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in place. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either of these carbons, leading to two different products:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, attack at either C1 or C2 leads to the same single product after protonation.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The addition of the -NH₂ group followed by protonation results in **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in a suitable solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3). This is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Position 6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position 2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. However, both reactions are possible and will occur. This leads to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6. The resulting carbanion then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C-2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. The resulting carbanion then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n          -> This link is a placeholder, the description is what matters. Let's describe it:\n        1-bromobenzene-2-d reacts with NH2-. The base abstracts D from C2, forming a carbanion at C2. Then Br- leaves from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. The resulting benzyne has no deuterium.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final aniline products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        The nucleophile (NH2⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n        1.  **Attack at C-1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring to prioritize the -NH2 group at position 1, the deuterium is now at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        So, Pathway A produces two distinct products: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (from non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        The nucleophile (NH2⁻) attacks the non-deuterated benzyne (triple bond between C-1 and C-2).\n        1.  **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, attack at either C-1 or C-2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which has no deuterium.\n        So, Pathway B produces one product: aniline.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    By considering both possible elimination pathways, we find a total of three unique organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    2.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.

This process is slower but still occurs. This elimination results in a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2.

There are two acidic hydrogens ortho to the bromine: a deuterium (D) at the C2 position and a hydrogen (H) at the C6 position.

NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** Leads to the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    2.  **Attack at C2:** Also leads to the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    Both attacks on this symmetrical intermediate lead to the same single product.\n\n     \n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction by removing a proton or deuteron from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\nThere are two possible pathways for this initial elimination step, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **H-abstraction:** The amide ion removes a hydrogen atom (H) from the C6 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming an intermediate called **3-deuterobenzyne**. In this intermediate, the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n2.  **D-abstraction:** The amide ion removes the deuterium atom (D) from the C2 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a different intermediate, **benzyne**. In this case, the triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the deuterium atom has been removed.\n\nEach of these two benzyne intermediates can then be attacked by a nucleophile (the amide ion, NH2-) in the addition step.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path 1):**\n    *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   This pathway produces two distinct products.\n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from Path 2):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, yields **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n    *   This pathway produces one distinct product.\n\nCombining the outcomes from both possible pathways, there are three unique organic products formed in this reaction:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an elimination-addition reaction mechanism, specifically through a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to determine the number of products:\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, and the reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. NaNH2 is a very strong base, which indicates a benzyne mechanism.\n2.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination):** The amide anion (NH2-) will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   **Pathway A:** The base can abstract the hydrogen (H) from carbon-6. This results in an anion that expels the bromide ion, forming a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains, so this intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B:** The base can abstract the deuteron (D) from carbon-2. This is less likely due to the stronger C-D bond (a kinetic isotope effect), but it is still a possible pathway. This results in an anion that expels the bromide ion, forming a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this step, so the intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack on Intermediates (Addition):** The amide anion (NH2-) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond.\n    *   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (from Pathway A):** The NH2- can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deutero-aniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deutero-aniline**.\n        These are two distinct products.\n    *   **Products from benzyne (from Pathway B):** The NH2- can attack either C1 or C2. Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, both attack sites lead to the same product after protonation: **aniline**. This is a single, third product.\n4.  **Count the Products:** By considering all possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products: 2-deutero-aniline, 3-deutero-aniline, and aniline.\n\nThe following Python code explains this logic and prints the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_benzyne_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the logic to determine the number of possible organic products\n    when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The reaction proceeds via an elimination-addition (benzyne) mechanism.\n    # The starting material has two different ortho \"protons\": an H at C6 and a D at C2.\n    # This leads to two different elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    # Pathway A: Removal of H from C6 leads to 3-deutero-benzyne.\n    # The nucleophile NH2- can attack the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond (C1 and C6).\n    # Attack at C1 -> product is 2-deutero-aniline.\n    # Attack at C6 -> product is 3-deutero-aniline.\n    products_from_pathway_A = {\"2-deutero-aniline\", \"3-deutero-aniline\"}\n    \n    # Pathway B: Removal of D from C2 leads to non-deuterated benzyne.\n    # The nucleophile NH2- can attack the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond (C1 and C2).\n    # Since the intermediate is symmetric and has no deuterium, both attacks yield the same product.\n    # Attack at C1 or C2 -> product is aniline.\n    products_from_pathway_B = {\"aniline\"}\n    \n    # The total set of unique products is the union of the products from both pathways.\n    total_unique_products = products_from_pathway_A.union(products_from_pathway_B)\n    \n    number_of_products = len(total_unique_products)\n    \n    print(\"The reaction can proceed through two different benzyne intermediates, leading to a set of unique products.\")\n    print(\"The possible products are:\")\n    for product in sorted(list(total_unique_products)):\n        print(f\"- {product}\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nThe total number of possible organic products is:\")\n    print(number_of_products)\n\nsolve_benzyne_reaction()\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The reaction can proceed through two different benzyne intermediates, leading to a set of unique products.\nThe possible products are:\n- 2-deutero-aniline\n- 3-deutero-aniline\n- aniline\n\nThe total number of possible organic products is:\n3\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and NaNH2 in liquid ammonia.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring that has a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like sodium amide proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) from NaNH2 acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect, it is easier and faster for the base to remove the proton (H) from C6 than the deuteron (d) from C2. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both elimination pathways, even if one is slower than the other.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion's lone pair expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of d from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion's lone pair expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻), will now attack one of the carbons of the strained triple bond in the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The two ends of the triple bond are not chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. By IUPAC naming conventions (numbering the ring to give the substituent the lowest number), if the -NH2 group is at position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway B (standard benzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Whether the NH2⁻ attacks C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation will lead to the same single product: **aniline** (aminobenzene).\n\n**4. Final Tally of Possible Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can list all the unique organic products that can be formed:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **three** possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed (liquid) ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base, with the active species being the amide ion (NH2-).\n    *   The reaction of a halobenzene with sodium amide is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), it is easier and faster for the base to abstract the proton (H) from C6 than the deuteron (D) from C2. However, both abstractions are possible.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **2-deuterio-1,6-didehydrobenzene**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **1,2-didehydrobenzene (benzyne)**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is another amide ion (NH2-), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final aniline product.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A's Intermediate (Benzyne with D at C2, triple bond C1-C6):**\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group adds to C1. This creates a carbanion at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The resulting product has the NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group adds to C6. This creates a carbanion at C1, which is then protonated. The resulting product has the NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. The positional relationship between the NH2 group and D is meta (1,3). So, this product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Pathway A leads to two distinct deuterated products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B's Intermediate (Standard Benzyne, triple bond C1-C2):**\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C2. Protonation yields aniline.\n        2.  **Attack at C2:** The NH2 group adds to C2, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation also yields aniline.\n        *   Pathway B leads to only one product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Count the Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   The question asks for the number of *possible* organic products. Since both elimination pathways (A and B) are mechanistically possible (even though Pathway A is faster), we must count all the products that can be formed.\n    *   The unique products are:\n        1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.

The number of possible products is determined by the different intermediates that can form and the ways the nucleophile can add to them.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction pathways:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH2⁻), abstracts an acidic hydrogen (or deuterium) from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine-bearing carbon. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of a proton (H):** The base can remove a proton from the C6 position. This is generally faster than removing deuterium due to the kinetic isotope effect. This elimination of HBr leads to a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium remains at C2. This intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D):** The base can also remove the deuteron from the C2 position. This is a slower process but is still possible. This elimination of DBr results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this is a **standard, non-deuterated benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, NH2⁻, then attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3) to give the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 2-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) adds to C1, and a subsequent protonation at C6 yields **1-amino-2-deuterobenzene** (also known as 2-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group adds to C6, and a subsequent protonation at C1 yields **1-amino-3-deuterobenzene** (also known as 3-deuteroaniline).\n    *   Thus, the deuterated benzyne intermediate leads to two distinct deuterated aniline products.\n\n*   **Product from standard benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The amino group can add to either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne. In either case, subsequent protonation yields the same single product: **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, three different organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  1-amino-2-deuterobenzene\n2.  1-amino-3-deuterobenzene\n3.

The number of possible products is determined by the different pathways the reaction can take.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nSodium amide is a very strong base and initiates the reaction by removing a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   The deuterium (D) atom at carbon-2.\n*   The hydrogen (H) atom at carbon-6.\n\nBecause a carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than a carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond, the removal of the hydrogen at C-6 is kinetically favored. However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, both deprotonation pathways must be considered.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C-6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C-1 and C-6. This intermediate still contains the deuterium atom at C-2.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C-2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C-1 and C-2. This intermediate does not contain deuterium.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzynes**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent to yield the final aniline products.\n\n*   **Products from Pathway A (Deuterated Benzyne):**\n    *   If the amide attacks C-1, the final product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   If the amide attacks C-6, the final product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Pathway B (Non-deuterated Benzyne):**\n    *   Attack at either C-1 or C-2, followed by protonation with ammonia, results in the formation of **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nConsidering all possible pathways, three distinct organic products can be formed:\n1.

Elimination Step: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide (NH₂⁻), abstracts an acidic proton from the position adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such adjacent positions:\n*   **Pathway A:** Abstraction of a hydrogen atom (H) from the C6 position.\n*   **Pathway B:** Abstraction of a deuterium atom (D) from the C2 position.\n\nAlthough the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond, meaning Pathway A is kinetically favored, both pathways are possible and lead to different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **From Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Removal of H from C6 and subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 results in a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at the C2 position. This creates **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **From Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of D from C2 and subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 results in a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium has been removed, forming a **non-deuterated benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**2. Addition Step: Formation of Final Products**\n\nThe nucleophilic amide ion (or ammonia solvent) then attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne:** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The amide can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond:\n    1.  Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Attack on non-deuterated benzyne:** This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by the amide ion leads to a single product: **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, combining the outcomes of both possible initial elimination steps, there are three distinct possible organic products.\n\nThe three possible organic products are:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-Deuteroaniline\n*   3-Deuteroaniline\n\nThus, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule substituted with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) dissolved in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, NH₂⁻, is the active species).\n    *   This combination of an aryl halide and a very strong base is characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction** that proceeds through a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   Position C-2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n        *   Position C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Since both hydrogen and deuterium can be abstracted by the strong base, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C-6**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6.\n        2.  The resulting negative charge on C-6 triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  A triple bond is formed between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains in the molecule.\n        4.  This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuteron from C-2**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. (Note: The C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond, so this pathway is slower due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The resulting negative charge on C-2 triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  A triple bond is formed between C-1 and C-2.

The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n        *   The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group adds to C-1. The carbanion forms at C-6. Protonation of C-6 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂ group adds to C-6. The carbanion forms at C-1. Protonation of C-1 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2.

Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe amide ion can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6:** The removal of H⁺ from C6 and the subsequent elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2:** The removal of D⁺ from C2 and the elimination of Br⁻ from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium is removed from the ring. This intermediate is **benzyne** (with no deuterium).\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond, so Path A is favored. However, both reactions occur, leading to the formation of both benzyne intermediates.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Addition to Benzyne (from Path B):**\n    *   The benzyne formed has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and is symmetrical with respect to the incoming nucleophile.\n    *   Attack of NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, leads to the same product: **Aniline**.\n\n2.  **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2. It is not symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If the NH₂⁻ group attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the amino group and the deuterium are ortho to each other).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If the NH₂⁻ group attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the amino group and the deuterium are meta to each other).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the products from both pathways, we get a total of three possible organic products:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction by abstracting a proton.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two hydrogen isotopes on the carbons adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom: a deuterium (D) at the C2 position and a hydrogen (H) at the C6 position. The amide base can abstract either of these, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H+ from C6:** The amide ion removes the proton from the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D+ from C2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from the C2 position. Subsequently, the bromide ion is eliminated from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the aromatic ring, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nIn the second stage of the reaction, the nucleophilic amide ion (NH2-) attacks the newly formed triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) attaches to C1, and subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6. Protonation at C1 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne (from Pathway B):** The nucleophile attacks the symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne intermediate.\n    3.  Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, results in the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\nTherefore, the reaction yields a mixture of three distinct organic products.\n\nThe three possible organic products are:\n1.  2-Deuteroaniline\n2.  3-Deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nThus, there are a total of **3** possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. Isotopic labeling, using isotopes like deuterium (²H), is a common technique to study such reaction mechanisms.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the possible reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of a proton (H) from C6:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom at the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻), forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in place. This intermediate is 3-deuteriobenzyne.\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D) from C2:** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This also results in the elimination of the bromide ion and the formation of a benzyne intermediate, this time with the triple bond between C1 and C2. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne. Although the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), making this pathway slower, it is still a possible route for the reaction.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack and Product Formation:** The benzyne intermediates are highly reactive and will be attacked by the nucleophilic amide ion.\n\n    *   **From 3-deuteriobenzyne (Path A):** The amide ion can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of 2-deuterioaniline after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of 3-deuterioaniline after protonation.\n        Therefore, Path A yields **two** distinct organic products.\n\n    *   **From benzyne (Path B):** The amide ion attacks the symmetrical benzyne intermediate.\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, results in the formation of aniline (non-deuterated).\n        Therefore, Path B yields **one** organic product.\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find a total of three possible organic products:\n\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n*   Aniline\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. The Reactant and Reagents**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2. The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base. The amide ion (NH2⁻) will act as the base in the elimination step and as the nucleophile in the addition step.\n\n**2. The Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Elimination to form a benzyne intermediate.**\n    The strong base (NH2⁻) abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. This is known as the kinetic isotope effect (KIE). Therefore, the abstraction of the proton from C6 will be faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2. However, both pathways are possible and will lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6):**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2):**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Stage 2: Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3).\n\n*   **Addition to 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. These two carbons are not equivalent because of the nearby deuterium at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either carbon.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** This forms a carbanion at C6. Protonation of C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** This forms a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    So, Pathway A leads to two different products.\n\n*   **Addition to Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2. These two carbons are equivalent in the symmetric benzyne molecule.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 (or C2):** This forms a carbanion at C2 (or C1). Protonation yields **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    So, Pathway B leads to one product.\n\n**4. Summary of Possible Products**\n\nCombining the outcomes from both possible pathways, we have three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.

In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two different *ortho* positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to the formation of two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Although a C-D bond is stronger than a C-H bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), this reaction path still occurs. This elimination also results in the loss of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the resulting intermediate is a standard **benzyne** molecule, as the deuterium atom has been removed.\n\n### Step 2: Addition of the Nucleophile to the Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide anion (NH₂⁻), then attacks the highly reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia).\n\n1.  **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This places the amino group (-NH₂) at C1 and creates a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the -NH₂ and -D groups are ortho to each other).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** This places the amino group at C6 and creates a carbanion at C1. Protonation yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the -NH₂ and -D groups are meta to each other).\n\n2.  **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):** The amide ion attacks either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2).\n    *   Regardless of whether the attack is at C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation results in the formation of **aniline** (aminobenzene), a molecule with no deuterium.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the outcomes of both pathways, three unique organic products can be formed:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-Deuterioaniline\n*   3-Deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, and the reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds via a **benzyne** intermediate.\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Benzyne Formation)**: The strong base, amide (NH2-), will abstract a proton (H) or a deuteron (D) from one of the two positions ortho to the bromine atom. This creates two distinct pathways.\n    *   **Pathway A**: Abstraction of the hydrogen (H) from carbon-6. This is the faster reaction and leads to a **deuterated benzyne intermediate**.\n    *   **Pathway B**: Abstraction of the deuterium (D) from carbon-2. This is slower but still possible, leading to a **non-deuterated benzyne intermediate**.\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Product Formation)**: The nucleophile (NH2-) will attack each of the benzyne intermediates. We will analyze the products from each pathway.\n    *   The **deuterated benzyne** can be attacked at two different carbons of the triple bond, leading to two distinct deuterated aniline products.\n    *   The **non-deuterated benzyne** leads to a single, non-deuterated aniline product.\n4.  **Count Unique Products**: We will combine the products from all possible pathways and count the number of unique molecules to find the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this step-by-step reasoning to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 to determine\n    the number of possible organic products.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2/NH3.\")\n    print(\"This reaction proceeds via an elimination-addition (benzyne) mechanism.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Elimination to form benzyne intermediates\n    # The base NH2- can abstract a proton from C6 or a deuteron from C2.\n    print(\"Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\")\n    \n    # Pathway A: H-abstraction from C6\n    # This leads to a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    # The deuterium at C2 is retained on the ring.\n    intermediate_A = \"3-deutero-benzyne\"\n    print(f\"  - Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6) leads to: {intermediate_A}\")\n\n    # Pathway B: D-abstraction from C2\n    # This leads to a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    # The deuterium is removed from the ring.\n    intermediate_B = \"undeuterated benzyne\"\n    print(f\"  - Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2) leads to: {intermediate_B}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Addition of NH2- to the benzyne intermediates\n    print(\"Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition of NH2- to Intermediates\")\n    \n    # Products from Intermediate A (3-deutero-benzyne)\n    # The nucleophile can attack C1 or C6 of the benzyne bond.\n    # Attack at C1 -> Product has NH2 at C1, D at C2 -> 2-deutero-aniline\n    # Attack at C6 -> Product has NH2 at C6, D at C2 -> 3-deutero-aniline\n    products_from_A = {\"2-deutero-aniline\", \"3-deutero-aniline\"}\n    print(f\"  - Products from '{intermediate_A}': {products_from_A}\")\n\n    # Products from Intermediate B (undeuterated benzyne)\n    # Attack at either C1 or C2 of the benzyne gives the same product.\n    products_from_B = {\"aniline\"}\n    print(f\"  - Products from '{intermediate_B}': {products_from_B}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step 3: Count the total number of unique products\n    print(\"Step 3: Counting the Total Unique Products\")\n    all_possible_products = products_from_A.union(products_from_B)\n    number_of_products = len(all_possible_products)\n    \n    print(f\"The complete set of possible organic products is: {all_possible_products}\")\n    print(f\"The total number of possible organic products is: {number_of_products}\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing this to the given choices:\")\n    print(\"A) 1\")\n    print(\"B) 2\")\n    print(\"C) 4\")\n    print(\"D) 3\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct choice is D because there are {number_of_products} possible products.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Analyzing the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2/NH3.\nThis reaction proceeds via an elimination-addition (benzyne) mechanism.\n--------------------------------------------------\nStep 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n  - Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6) leads to: 3-deutero-benzyne\n  - Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2) leads to: undeuterated benzyne\n--------------------------------------------------\nStep 2: Nucleophilic Addition of NH2- to Intermediates\n  - Products from '3-deutero-benzyne': {'3-deutero-aniline', '2-deutero-aniline'}\n  - Products from 'undeuterated benzyne': {'aniline'}\n--------------------------------------------------\nStep 3: Counting the Total Unique Products\nThe complete set of possible organic products is: {'aniline', '3-deutero-aniline', '2-deutero-aniline'}\nThe total number of possible organic products is: 3\n\nComparing this to the given choices:\nA) 1\nB) 2\nC) 4\nD) 3\n\nThe correct choice is D because there are 3 possible products.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring substituted with a bromine (Br) atom at position 1 and a deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen) atom at position 2. The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are occupied by standard hydrogen (H) atoms.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂). This is an extremely strong base. The active species is the amide anion (NH₂⁻).\n    *   **Solvent:** Condensed (liquid) ammonia (NH₃).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base typically proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong base NH₂⁻ abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Br). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n    *   **Position C-2:** This position holds a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   **Position C-6:** This position holds a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The base can abstract either the H from C-6 or the D from C-2. This leads to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6.\n        2.  The electrons from the C6-H bond form a new bond between C-6 and C-1, creating a triple bond.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C-1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne** (if the triple bond is numbered C1-C6, the deuterium is at C3).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. (Note: This is slower than H⁺ abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The electrons from the C2-D bond form a new bond between C-2 and C-1, creating a triple bond.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C-1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the molecule. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\n    So, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃). We must analyze the addition to each intermediate separately.\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deutero-benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate has a triple bond between C-1 and C-6, and a deuterium at C-2.\n        *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-6 of the triple bond. These two atoms are not equivalent because of the deuterium at C-2.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or o-deuteroaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber this molecule so that the -NH₂ group is at C-1, the deuterium is at C-3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline** (or m-deuteroaniline).\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate has a triple bond between C-1 and C-2 and no deuterium.\n        *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-2. Since the benzyne is symmetrical (in the absence of other substituents), both attacks lead to the same product.\n        *   **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** The -NH₂ group attaches to one carbon of the former triple bond, and the other carbon is protonated. The final product has no deuterium. This is simply **aniline**.\n\n### Listing All Possible Products and Careful Points\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two Elimination Pathways:** The presence of both H and D at the ortho positions is the crucial starting point. It means two different elimination pathways must be considered.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):** The C-H bond is broken more easily and quickly than the C-D bond. This means Pathway A is faster than Pathway B, and the deuterated products (2- and 3-deuteroaniline) will be the major products. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must include the product from the slower Pathway B.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Asymmetric Benzyne Addition:** The benzyne intermediate from Pathway A is asymmetric due to the deuterium substituent. Attack by the nucleophile at the two ends of the triple bond leads to two different constitutional isomers (isotopomers).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Symmetric Benzyne Addition:** The benzyne intermediate from Pathway B is symmetric, so attack at either end yields only one product.\n\n### Final Tally of Products\n\nFrom the analysis, we have identified three distinct possible organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia, which is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction proceeding through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a position ortho to the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions: C6 (with a hydrogen atom, H) and C2 (with a deuterium atom, D).\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    *   The NH2- base can abstract the proton (H) from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    *   This abstraction forms a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The subsequent loss of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1 results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    ```\n    (Starting material)             (3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n         Br                                 (triple bond)\n        / \\                                /     \\\n       D---C1                             D---C2--C1\n      / \\ / \\                           /  \\   /\n     H---C6                             H---C3==C6\n      \\ /                                \\  /\n       ...                                ...\n    ```\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    *   Alternatively, the NH2- base can abstract the deuteron (D) from the C2 position. This pathway is possible, although slower than Path A.\n    *   This abstraction forms a carbanion at C2, and the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.\n    *   The subsequent loss of Br- from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed in this process, the resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    ```\n    (Starting material)             (Benzyne intermediate)\n         Br                                 (triple bond)\n        / \\                                /     \\\n       D---C1                             H---C2==C1\n      / \\ / \\                           /  \\   /\n     ...

This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final aniline products.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A)**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2- can attack either C1 or C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1, and a proton (from NH3) adds to C6. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or o-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6, and a proton adds to C1. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. Based on IUPAC naming (where -NH2 defines C1), this is **3-deuteroaniline** (or m-deuteroaniline).\n    *   So, Path A leads to two distinct products.\n\n*   **Addition to Benzyne (from Path B)**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical.

The number of possible organic products can be determined by considering all feasible reaction pathways.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is generally the faster reaction due to the kinetic isotope effect (a C-H bond is broken more easily than a C-D bond). The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 generates a **3-deuterobenzyne** intermediate. In this intermediate, the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at C2.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. Although slower, this pathway is still possible. The removal of the deuteron and the subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 result in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium at C2 was removed, the resulting intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻), acting as a nucleophile, then attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The NH₂⁻ nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.

Let's analyze the specific case of 1-bromobenzene-2-d.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThe bond to hydrogen (C-H) is weaker than the bond to deuterium (C-D). Because of this kinetic isotope effect, it is easier and faster for the base to remove the hydrogen at position 6 than the deuterium at position 2. This leads to two possible competing elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Major Pathway:** The amide ion abstracts the hydrogen from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 creates a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n2.  **Minor Pathway:** Less frequently, the amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion, attacks the reactive \"triple\" bond of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (Major pathway):**\n    *   The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (Minor pathway):**\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate.\n    *   The resulting product is simply **aniline**, containing no deuterium.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nConsidering both the major and minor pathways, three distinct organic products are possible:\n\n1.  2-Deuteroaniline\n2.  3-Deuteroaniline\n3.

To determine the number of possible organic products, we must consider all potential reaction pathways.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH2⁻) from NaNH2, abstracts a proton from a carbon atom ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6**, which holds a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2**, which holds a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, meaning the abstraction of the hydrogen is kinetically favored. This phenomenon is known as the kinetic isotope effect. However, both abstractions are possible and lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C-6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains at C-2. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C-2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 results in a benzyne with the triple bond between C-1 and C-2.

Aniline\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   Reactant: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   Reagents: Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   Reaction: The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) from NaNH₂ acts as a strong base and removes a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n    *   Position 2, which holds a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   Position 6, which holds a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of the proton (H) from C-6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D) from C-2. However, both reactions are *possible*. Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates will be formed.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C-6.**\n        1.  NH₂⁻ abstracts H⁺ from C-6, forming a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion intermediate loses a bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains at C-2. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C-2.**\n        1.  NH₂⁻ abstracts D⁺ from C-2.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion loses a bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom has been removed. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia, NH₃) to give the final aniline product.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        The intermediate, 3-deuteriobenzyne, has a triple bond between C-1 and C-6 and a deuterium at C-2. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-6.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** NH₂ group attaches to C-1. The resulting carbanion at C-6 is protonated by NH₃. The product is 1-amino-2-deuteriobenzene, also known as **2-deuterioaniline** (or *ortho*-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** NH₂ group attaches to C-6. The resulting carbanion at C-1 is protonated. In the final product, the NH₂ group is at position 1 (by convention), and the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline** (or *meta*-deuterioaniline).\n        Therefore, the major pathway leads to *two* distinct organic products.\n\n    *   **Product from Pathway B (via benzyne):**\n        The intermediate is a symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne. Attack by NH₂⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, yields the same product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n        Therefore, the minor pathway leads to *one* additional distinct organic product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\n    By considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three chemically distinct organic products:\n    1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Path A)\n    2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Path A)\n    3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\n    These three molecules are all possible products of the reaction. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This set of reactants and conditions points to an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the substrate and the reaction.**\n*   Substrate: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where C1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br) and the adjacent carbon, C2, is attached to a deuterium atom (D). All other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   Reagent: NaNH2 in NH3. Sodium amide is a very strong base. The amide ion (NH2-) is the active species.\n*   Reaction type: Elimination-Addition via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination).**\nThe strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n1.  **C2**, which bears a deuterium (D).\n2.  **C6**, which bears a hydrogen (H).\n\nThe base can abstract from either position, leading to two different pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6.**\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of a proton (H+) from C6 is significantly faster than the abstraction of a deuteron (D+) from C2. This is therefore the major reaction pathway.\n    1.  NH2- removes H+ from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    3.  This results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2.**\n    Although slower, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is still a possible reaction.\n    1.  NH2- removes D+ from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The original deuterium atom is removed from the molecule during this process. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition).**\nThe amide ion (NH2-), acting as a nucleophile, attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation (by the solvent, NH3) of the resulting carbanion to yield the final aniline product(s).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The NH2- nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6. These two carbons are not equivalent.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** This forms a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion gives **2-deuterioaniline** (or o-deuterioaniline).\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** This forms a carbanion at C1. Protonation of this carbanion gives **3-deuterioaniline** (or m-deuterioaniline).\n    Since both modes of attack are possible, Pathway A leads to **two** different organic products.\n\n*   **Attack on benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2. The intermediate is symmetrical.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 (or C2):** The attack of NH2- at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2). The deuterium is not present in this product because it was removed in the first step of this pathway.\n    Pathway B leads to **one** organic product.\n\n**Step 4: Count the total number of unique organic products.**\nCombining the products from both possible pathways:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nThese three molecules (aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline) are structurally distinct compounds. Therefore, there are a total of three possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe user wants to find the number of possible organic products from the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide in liquid ammonia.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂) is a classic example of an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In the starting molecule, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both elimination pathways, even though the removal of H is kinetically favored over the removal of D (due to the kinetic isotope effect).\n\n*   **Pathway A: Removal of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton from C6.\n    2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C6, ejecting the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step. The intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Removal of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2.\n    2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C2, ejecting the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe nucleophile (another amide ion, NH₂⁻) attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical due to the deuterium at C2. The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond, leading to two distinct products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. After protonation of the carbanion at C6, the product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. After protonation of the carbanion at C1, the product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond leads to the same product after protonation.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The -NH₂ group adds, and the product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products can be formed:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.

The amide ion (NH2-), a strong base, initiates the reaction by removing a proton or deuteron from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom.\n\nIn the case of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two possible sites for this initial abstraction:\n1.  **Removal of a hydrogen atom (H) from C6:** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, making this the kinetically favored pathway. This elimination of H from C6 and Br from C1 results in an intermediate called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Removal of a deuterium atom (D) from C2:** While slower due to the stronger C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), this pathway is still possible. This elimination removes the deuterium atom entirely, leading to a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nOnce these two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed, the amide ion (NH2-), acting as a nucleophile, attacks them. This leads to the formation of different products:\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne:** The amide ion can attack either of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond.\n    *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n*   **Attack on the non-deuterated benzyne:** The amide ion attacks the symmetrical benzyne intermediate, and after protonation by the ammonia solvent, the sole product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, combining the outcomes of both possible initial steps, a total of three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-deuteroaniline\n*   3-deuteroaniline\n\nThis makes for a total of three possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of an aromatic nucleophilic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D), a stable isotope of hydrogen.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible and lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **H-abstraction (major pathway):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **D-abstraction (minor pathway):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive \"triple\" bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Addition to 3-Deuterobenzyne:**\nThis intermediate is asymmetrical. The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n*   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C1. After protonation, the final product has the amino group at position 1 and the deuterium at position 2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n*   **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6. After protonation, the final product has the amino group at position 6 (which is renumbered to 1 for nomenclature) and the deuterium at position 2 relative to the original bromine, which becomes position 3 relative to the new amino group. This is **3-deuteroaniline** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n\n**Addition to Non-deuterated Benzyne:**\nThis intermediate is symmetrical. Attack of the amide ion at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to a single product.\n*   The product is simple **aniline**, with no deuterium.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the outcomes from both pathways, a total of three distinct organic products are formed in this reaction:\n1.

The number of possible products is determined by the different pathways the reaction can take.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Elimination and Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nSodium amide is a very strong base that can remove a proton (or deuteron) from a position adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n1.  **Removal of Deuterium (D) from C2:** The amide ion can remove the deuterium atom at the C2 position.\n2.  **Removal of Hydrogen (H) from C6:** The amide ion can also remove the hydrogen atom at the C6 position.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking the weaker C-H bond is faster than breaking the stronger C-D bond. However, both eliminations occur, leading to the formation of two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n*   **Benzyne A (from D removal):** This intermediate has no deuterium and possesses a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n*   **Benzyne B (from H removal):** This intermediate still contains the deuterium atom at C2, with the triple bond located between C1 and C6.\n\n**Step 2: Addition and Formation of Final Products**\n\nThe nucleophile in the reaction, the amide ion (NH2-), attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. This can happen at either carbon of the triple bond.\n\n*   **Reaction of Benzyne A:** Attack by the amide ion at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, leads to the formation of a single product:\n    *   **Product 1: Aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n*   **Reaction of Benzyne B (3-deuterobenzyne):** This deuterated intermediate can be attacked at two different positions:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amide ion adds to C1.

The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n       (Conceptual diagram)\n    Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene -> Intermediate 1: 3-deuterobenzyne\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower but still possible.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C2, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   This forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n      (Conceptual diagram)\n    Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene -> Intermediate 2: Benzyne\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), will now attack the triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2.\n    *   The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond:\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway A leads to two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    *   The amide ion attacks one of the carbons of the triple bond (e.g., C1), forming a carbanion at the other (C2).\n    *   Protonation of the carbanion by NH₃ gives the final product.\n    *   Since there is no deuterium in this intermediate and the proton source is NH₃, the product is simply **aniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway B leads to one product: aniline.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we get three unique organic products:\n1.  Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (o-deuteroaniline)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (m-deuteroaniline)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Reactant and Potential Abstraction Sites:** The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The bromine is at the C1 position, and a deuterium atom is at the C2 position. The positions ortho to the bromine are C2 (which has a deuterium, D) and C6 (which has a hydrogen, H).\n\n2.  **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond. Consequently, the amide base will abstract the proton from the C6 position more readily than the deuteron from the C2 position. This phenomenon is known as a primary kinetic isotope effect. However, both abstractions are possible.\n\n3.  **Pathway 1: Abstraction of Hydrogen (Major Pathway):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C6.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   The nucleophilic amide ion (NH2-) can then attack either carbon of the benzyne triple bond:\n        *   **Attack at C1:** This leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline** (m-deuterioaniline) after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline** (o-deuterioaniline) after protonation.\n\n4.  **Pathway 2: Abstraction of Deuterium (Minor Pathway):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower due to the kinetic isotope effect but still occurs.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C2, which eliminates the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   In this process, the deuterium is removed. The intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   The nucleophilic amide ion attacks this benzyne, which, after protonation, yields a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nSince both pathways are possible, three distinct organic products can be formed from the reaction.\n\nThe possible products are:\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n*   Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction is between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Benzyne Formation):** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine atom.\n    *   The starting material has two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C6 (with a hydrogen, H) and C2 (with a deuterium, D).\n    *   **Pathway A:** The base abstracts the proton from C6. This is generally faster because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. This elimination forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2.\n    *   **Pathway B:** The base abstracts the deuteron from C2. This elimination forms a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack):** The nucleophile, amide ion (NH2-), attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Products from Pathway A's Intermediate (Benzyne C1-C6, D at C2):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The NH2 group adds to C1. Subsequent protonation by ammonia adds an H to C6. The final product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6: The NH2 group adds to C6. Subsequent protonation adds an H to C1. The final product, when numbered with the NH2 group at position 1, is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   This pathway yields **two** distinct products.\n    *   **Products from Pathway B's Intermediate (Benzyne C1-C2, no D):**\n        *   Attack at C1 or C2: The NH2 group adds to either carbon of the triple bond. In both cases, after protonation, the final product is simply **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   This pathway yields **one** distinct product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition products, we find a total of three unique organic products: 2-deuterioaniline, 3-deuterioaniline, and aniline.\n\n```python\n# This problem involves an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the possible benzyne intermediates.\n# The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. The positions ortho to the bromine are C2 (bearing a D) and C6 (bearing an H).\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (C-H bonds are weaker and break more easily than C-D bonds).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at position C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  Although slower, the amide ion can also remove the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is simply **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**Step 3: The Addition Step - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields **2-deuteroaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2).\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields **3-deuteroaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the NH2 group position 1, the D is at position 3).\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Path B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by NH2⁻ at C1 or C2 leads to the same result after protonation.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 (or C2):** The NH2⁻ attacks one carbon of the triple bond, and the other carbon becomes a carbanion, which is then protonated by NH3. The resulting product has no deuterium and is simply **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: List All Possible Products**\nBased on the analysis of the two reaction pathways, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nThese three molecules are isotopomers and are chemically distinct. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) means that Path A (H-abstraction) is faster than Path B (D-abstraction). This affects the relative amounts of the products, but the question asks for the *number* of possible products, so we must consider all possible, even minor, pathways.\n*   The nucleophilic addition to the unsymmetrical 3-deuterobenzyne occurs at both possible sites (C1 and C6), leading to two different products.\n*   The final protonation step uses a proton (H) from the solvent (NH3), not a deuteron.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction produces three different organic molecules: aniline, 2-deuteroaniline, and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type**\n    The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in a suitable solvent (liquid ammonia). These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at position C1. The ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The base can abstract a proton from either of these positions, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:** The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. Simultaneously, the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. This intermediate is called 3-deuterobenzyne.\n        (Note: Abstraction of H is kinetically faster than abstraction of D due to the kinetic isotope effect, so this is the major pathway, but the question asks for all *possible* products).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:** The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. This benzyne intermediate has no deuterium atoms; it is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne.\n\n*   **Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. The relative positions of -NH2 and -D are meta (1,3). This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n        3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Whether the NH2⁻ attacks C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which contains no deuterium.\n\n*   **Step 4: Count the Distinct Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline\n    3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible organic products can be determined by analyzing the steps of the mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, a C-H bond is broken more easily and quickly than a C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains, resulting in **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking either carbon of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne intermediate leads to the formation of a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the possible products from both pathways, we find three distinct organic molecules:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible organic products can be determined by analyzing the formation of the intermediate and the subsequent nucleophilic attack.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Path A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can abstract a hydrogen atom from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect). This elimination of HBr results in the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**, an intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remaining at C2.\n    *   **Path B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also abstract the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This pathway is slower but still possible. The elimination of DBr results in the formation of a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):** The nucleophile (NH2-) can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Path B):** The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate. Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, the attack results in a single product: **aniline**.\n\nTherefore, three distinct organic products are possible from this reaction: aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C-6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium remains at C-2.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuterium from C-2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a different benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2.\n\nIt is worth noting that due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily than the C-D bond, so Pathway A is faster. However, both pathways are possible and lead to two different, isomeric benzyne intermediates.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide anion (NH₂⁻), then attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. The attack can occur at either carbon of the strained triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia.\n\n**Analysis of Products from Benzyne A (triple bond C1-C6):**\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-1. The resulting anion at C-6 is protonated by ammonia. The final product is aniline with the deuterium at C-2, which is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-6. The resulting anion at C-1 is protonated. The final product is again **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\nTherefore, Benzyne A leads to only one product: 2-deuterioaniline.\n\n**Analysis of Products from Benzyne B (triple bond C1-C2):**\n*   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-1. The anion forms at C-2 (the carbon with the deuterium). Protonation by ammonia yields aniline with the amino group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C-2:** The -NH₂ group adds to C-2. The anion forms at C-1. Protonation by ammonia yields aniline with the amino group at C-2 and the deuterium still at C-2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the attack on Benzyne B.\n*   Attack at C-1 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-1 and D at C-2. This is 2-deuterioaniline.\n*   Attack at C-2 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-2 and an anion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 gives aniline with NH₂ at C-2 and D at C-3 (relative to the new amino group). This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nLet's trace the positions carefully for the second case (attack at C-2 of Benzyne B):\n1.  Start: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene.\n2.  Benzyne B formation: Remove D from C-2 and Br from C-1. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. The other ring positions (C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6) have hydrogens.\n3.  Nucleophilic attack: NH₂⁻ attacks C-2. An anion forms at C-1.\n4.  Protonation: The anion at C-1 is protonated by NH₃.\n5.  Final Product: The -NH₂ group is on C-2. The original C-3 is now meta to the amino group. The original C-1 is now ortho to the amino group. Since no deuterium was on C-3, this product is **3-aminobenzene-d1**, which is **m-deuterioaniline** or **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nTherefore, the possible products are:\n*   From Benzyne A: 2-deuterioaniline\n*   From Benzyne B: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline\n\nCombining these, there are two unique possible organic products: **2-deuterioaniline** and **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nThe correct count of possible organic products is 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

One intermediate (benzyne) yields one product (aniline). The other, unsymmetrical intermediate (2-deuterobenzyne) yields two different constitutional isomers (2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline).\n\n    Therefore, the total number of possible organic products is three:\n    1.

Let's analyze the reaction step-by-step to determine all possible products.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe reagent, sodium amide (NaNH₂), is a very strong base. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) will abstract a proton from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of the proton (H⁺) from C6 is faster and represents the major pathway. However, the abstraction of the deuteron (D⁺) from C2 is also possible and occurs as a minor pathway. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion then expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in place. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either of these carbons, leading to two different products:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, attack at either C1 or C2 leads to the same single product after protonation.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The addition of the -NH₂ group followed by protonation results in **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in a suitable solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3). This is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Position 6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position 2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. However, both reactions are possible and will occur. This leads to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6. The resulting carbanion then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C-2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. The resulting carbanion then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n          -> This link is a placeholder, the description is what matters. Let's describe it:\n        1-bromobenzene-2-d reacts with NH2-. The base abstracts D from C2, forming a carbanion at C2. Then Br- leaves from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. The resulting benzyne has no deuterium.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final aniline products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        The nucleophile (NH2⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n        1.  **Attack at C-1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring to prioritize the -NH2 group at position 1, the deuterium is now at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        So, Pathway A produces two distinct products: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (from non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        The nucleophile (NH2⁻) attacks the non-deuterated benzyne (triple bond between C-1 and C-2).\n        1.  **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, attack at either C-1 or C-2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which has no deuterium.\n        So, Pathway B produces one product: aniline.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    By considering both possible elimination pathways, we find a total of three unique organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    2.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.

This elimination leads to the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This process is slower but still occurs. This elimination results in a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate from Pathway A:** The benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6 (and deuterium at C2) is attacked by an amide ion.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of aniline-2-d after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of aniline-6-d, which is the same molecule as aniline-2-d.\n        *   Therefore, Pathway A yields only one product: **aniline-2-d**.\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate from Pathway B:** The non-deuterated benzyne (triple bond between C1 and C2) is attacked by an amide ion.\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 results in the formation of a carbanion, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent to yield **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   Therefore, Pathway B yields only one product: **aniline**.\n\nSince two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed, two different organic products are possible.\n\nThe two possible organic products are:\n*   Aniline-2-d\n*   Aniline\n\nThus, there are a total of two possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.

There are two acidic hydrogens ortho to the bromine: a deuterium (D) at the C2 position and a hydrogen (H) at the C6 position.

The Elimination Step: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine-bearing carbon. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe amide base can abstract either the H or the D, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  The lone pair on the C6 carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.

The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction by removing a proton or deuteron from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\nThere are two possible pathways for this initial elimination step, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **H-abstraction:** The amide ion removes a hydrogen atom (H) from the C6 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming an intermediate called **3-deuterobenzyne**. In this intermediate, the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at the C2 position.\n2.  **D-abstraction:** The amide ion removes the deuterium atom (D) from the C2 position. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a different intermediate, **benzyne**. In this case, the triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the deuterium atom has been removed.\n\nEach of these two benzyne intermediates can then be attacked by a nucleophile (the amide ion, NH2-) in the addition step.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path 1):**\n    *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   This pathway produces two distinct products.\n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from Path 2):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, yields **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n    *   This pathway produces one distinct product.\n\nCombining the outcomes from both possible pathways, there are three unique organic products formed in this reaction:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an elimination-addition reaction mechanism, specifically through a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to determine the number of products:\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, and the reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. NaNH2 is a very strong base, which indicates a benzyne mechanism.\n2.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination):** The amide anion (NH2-) will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   **Pathway A:** The base can abstract the hydrogen (H) from carbon-6. This results in an anion that expels the bromide ion, forming a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains, so this intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B:** The base can abstract the deuteron (D) from carbon-2. This is less likely due to the stronger C-D bond (a kinetic isotope effect), but it is still a possible pathway. This results in an anion that expels the bromide ion, forming a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this step, so the intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack on Intermediates (Addition):** The amide anion (NH2-) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond.\n    *   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (from Pathway A):** The NH2- can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deutero-aniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deutero-aniline**.\n        These are two distinct products.\n    *   **Products from benzyne (from Pathway B):** The NH2- can attack either C1 or C2. Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, both attack sites lead to the same product after protonation: **aniline**. This is a single, third product.\n4.  **Count the Products:** By considering all possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products: 2-deutero-aniline, 3-deutero-aniline, and aniline.\n\nThe following Python code explains this logic and prints the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_benzyne_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the logic to determine the number of possible organic products\n    when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The reaction proceeds via an elimination-addition (benzyne) mechanism.\n    # The starting material has two different ortho \"protons\": an H at C6 and a D at C2.\n    # This leads to two different elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    # Pathway A: Removal of H from C6 leads to 3-deutero-benzyne.\n    # The nucleophile NH2- can attack the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond (C1 and C6).\n    # Attack at C1 -> product is 2-deutero-aniline.\n    # Attack at C6 -> product is 3-deutero-aniline.\n    products_from_pathway_A = {\"2-deutero-aniline\", \"3-deutero-aniline\"}\n    \n    # Pathway B: Removal of D from C2 leads to non-deuterated benzyne.\n    # The nucleophile NH2- can attack the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond (C1 and C2).\n    # Since the intermediate is symmetric and has no deuterium, both attacks yield the same product.\n    # Attack at C1 or C2 -> product is aniline.\n    products_from_pathway_B = {\"aniline\"}\n    \n    # The total set of unique products is the union of the products from both pathways.\n    total_unique_products = products_from_pathway_A.union(products_from_pathway_B)\n    \n    number_of_products = len(total_unique_products)\n    \n    print(\"The reaction can proceed through two different benzyne intermediates, leading to a set of unique products.\")\n    print(\"The possible products are:\")\n    for product in sorted(list(total_unique_products)):\n        print(f\"- {product}\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nThe total number of possible organic products is:\")\n    print(number_of_products)\n\nsolve_benzyne_reaction()\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The reaction can proceed through two different benzyne intermediates, leading to a set of unique products.\nThe possible products are:\n- 2-deutero-aniline\n- 3-deutero-aniline\n- aniline\n\nThe total number of possible organic products is:\n3\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and NaNH2 in liquid ammonia.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring that has a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like sodium amide proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) from NaNH2 acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect, it is easier and faster for the base to remove the proton (H) from C6 than the deuteron (d) from C2. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both elimination pathways, even if one is slower than the other.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion's lone pair expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of d from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion's lone pair expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻), will now attack one of the carbons of the strained triple bond in the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The two ends of the triple bond are not chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. By IUPAC naming conventions (numbering the ring to give the substituent the lowest number), if the -NH2 group is at position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway B (standard benzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium. The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Whether the NH2⁻ attacks C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation will lead to the same single product: **aniline** (aminobenzene).\n\n**4. Final Tally of Possible Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can list all the unique organic products that can be formed:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **three** possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed (liquid) ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base, with the active species being the amide ion (NH2-).\n    *   The reaction of a halobenzene with sodium amide is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), it is easier and faster for the base to abstract the proton (H) from C6 than the deuteron (D) from C2. However, both abstractions are possible.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **2-deuterio-1,6-didehydrobenzene**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **1,2-didehydrobenzene (benzyne)**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is another amide ion (NH2-), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final aniline product.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A's Intermediate (Benzyne with D at C2, triple bond C1-C6):**\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group adds to C1. This creates a carbanion at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The resulting product has the NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group adds to C6. This creates a carbanion at C1, which is then protonated. The resulting product has the NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. The positional relationship between the NH2 group and D is meta (1,3). So, this product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Pathway A leads to two distinct deuterated products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B's Intermediate (Standard Benzyne, triple bond C1-C2):**\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C2. Protonation yields aniline.\n        2.  **Attack at C2:** The NH2 group adds to C2, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation also yields aniline.\n        *   Pathway B leads to only one product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Count the Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   The question asks for the number of *possible* organic products. Since both elimination pathways (A and B) are mechanistically possible (even though Pathway A is faster), we must count all the products that can be formed.\n    *   The unique products are:\n        1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.

The number of possible products is determined by the different intermediates that can form and the ways the nucleophile can add to them.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction pathways:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH2⁻), abstracts an acidic hydrogen (or deuterium) from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine-bearing carbon. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of a proton (H):** The base can remove a proton from the C6 position. This is generally faster than removing deuterium due to the kinetic isotope effect. This elimination of HBr leads to a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium remains at C2. This intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D):** The base can also remove the deuteron from the C2 position. This is a slower process but is still possible. This elimination of DBr results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this is a **standard, non-deuterated benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, NH2⁻, then attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3) to give the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 2-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) adds to C1, and a subsequent protonation at C6 yields **1-amino-2-deuterobenzene** (also known as 2-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group adds to C6, and a subsequent protonation at C1 yields **1-amino-3-deuterobenzene** (also known as 3-deuteroaniline).\n    *   Thus, the deuterated benzyne intermediate leads to two distinct deuterated aniline products.\n\n*   **Product from standard benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The amino group can add to either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne. In either case, subsequent protonation yields the same single product: **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, three different organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  1-amino-2-deuterobenzene\n2.  1-amino-3-deuterobenzene\n3.

The number of possible products is determined by the different pathways the reaction can take.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nSodium amide is a very strong base and initiates the reaction by removing a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   The deuterium (D) atom at carbon-2.\n*   The hydrogen (H) atom at carbon-6.\n\nBecause a carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than a carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond, the removal of the hydrogen at C-6 is kinetically favored. However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, both deprotonation pathways must be considered.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C-6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C-1 and C-6. This intermediate still contains the deuterium atom at C-2.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C-2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C-1 and C-2. This intermediate does not contain deuterium.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzynes**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates.

Elimination Step: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide (NH₂⁻), abstracts an acidic proton from the position adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such adjacent positions:\n*   **Pathway A:** Abstraction of a hydrogen atom (H) from the C6 position.\n*   **Pathway B:** Abstraction of a deuterium atom (D) from the C2 position.\n\nAlthough the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond, meaning Pathway A is kinetically favored, both pathways are possible and lead to different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **From Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Removal of H from C6 and subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 results in a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at the C2 position. This creates **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **From Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of D from C2 and subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 results in a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium has been removed, forming a **non-deuterated benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**2. Addition Step: Formation of Final Products**\n\nThe nucleophilic amide ion (or ammonia solvent) then attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne:** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The amide can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond:\n    1.  Attack at C1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  Attack at C6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Attack on non-deuterated benzyne:** This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by the amide ion leads to a single product: **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, combining the outcomes of both possible initial elimination steps, there are three distinct possible organic products.\n\nThe three possible organic products are:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-Deuteroaniline\n*   3-Deuteroaniline\n\nThus, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule substituted with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) dissolved in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, NH₂⁻, is the active species).\n    *   This combination of an aryl halide and a very strong base is characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction** that proceeds through a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   Position C-2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n        *   Position C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Since both hydrogen and deuterium can be abstracted by the strong base, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C-6**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6.\n        2.  The resulting negative charge on C-6 triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  A triple bond is formed between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains in the molecule.\n        4.  This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuteron from C-2**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. (Note: The C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond, so this pathway is slower due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The resulting negative charge on C-2 triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  A triple bond is formed between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process.\n        4.

The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n        *   The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group adds to C-1. The carbanion forms at C-6. Protonation of C-6 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂ group adds to C-6. The carbanion forms at C-1. Protonation of C-1 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2.

Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe amide ion can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6:** The removal of H⁺ from C6 and the subsequent elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2:** The removal of D⁺ from C2 and the elimination of Br⁻ from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium is removed from the ring. This intermediate is **benzyne** (with no deuterium).\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond, so Path A is favored. However, both reactions occur, leading to the formation of both benzyne intermediates.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Addition to Benzyne (from Path B):**\n    *   The benzyne formed has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and is symmetrical with respect to the incoming nucleophile.\n    *   Attack of NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, leads to the same product: **Aniline**.\n\n2.  **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2. It is not symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If the NH₂⁻ group attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the amino group and the deuterium are ortho to each other).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If the NH₂⁻ group attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the amino group and the deuterium are meta to each other).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the products from both pathways, we get a total of three possible organic products:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction by abstracting a proton.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two hydrogen isotopes on the carbons adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom: a deuterium (D) at the C2 position and a hydrogen (H) at the C6 position. The amide base can abstract either of these, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H+ from C6:** The amide ion removes the proton from the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D+ from C2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from the C2 position. Subsequently, the bromide ion is eliminated from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the aromatic ring, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nIn the second stage of the reaction, the nucleophilic amide ion (NH2-) attacks the newly formed triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) attaches to C1, and subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6. Protonation at C1 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne (from Pathway B):** The nucleophile attacks the symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne intermediate.\n    3.  Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, results in the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\nTherefore, the reaction yields a mixture of three distinct organic products.\n\nThe three possible organic products are:\n1.  2-Deuteroaniline\n2.  3-Deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nThus, there are a total of **3** possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. Isotopic labeling, using isotopes like deuterium (²H), is a common technique to study such reaction mechanisms.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the possible reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of a proton (H) from C6:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom at the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻), forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in place. This intermediate is 3-deuteriobenzyne.\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D) from C2:** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom from the C2 position. This also results in the elimination of the bromide ion and the formation of a benzyne intermediate, this time with the triple bond between C1 and C2. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne. Although the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), making this pathway slower, it is still a possible route for the reaction.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack and Product Formation:** The benzyne intermediates are highly reactive and will be attacked by the nucleophilic amide ion.\n\n    *   **From 3-deuteriobenzyne (Path A):** The amide ion can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 leads to the formation of 2-deuterioaniline after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   Attack at C6 leads to the formation of 3-deuterioaniline after protonation.\n        Therefore, Path A yields **two** distinct organic products.\n\n    *   **From benzyne (Path B):** The amide ion attacks the symmetrical benzyne intermediate.\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, results in the formation of aniline (non-deuterated).\n        Therefore, Path B yields **one** organic product.\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find a total of three possible organic products:\n\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n*   Aniline\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. The Reactant and Reagents**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2. The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base. The amide ion (NH2⁻) will act as the base in the elimination step and as the nucleophile in the addition step.\n\n**2. The Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Elimination to form a benzyne intermediate.**\n    The strong base (NH2⁻) abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. This is known as the kinetic isotope effect (KIE). Therefore, the abstraction of the proton from C6 will be faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2. However, both pathways are possible and will lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6):**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2):**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Stage 2: Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3).\n\n*   **Addition to 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. These two carbons are not equivalent because of the nearby deuterium at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either carbon.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** This forms a carbanion at C6. Protonation of C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** This forms a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    So, Pathway A leads to two different products.\n\n*   **Addition to Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2. These two carbons are equivalent in the symmetric benzyne molecule.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 (or C2):** This forms a carbanion at C2 (or C1). Protonation yields **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    So, Pathway B leads to one product.\n\n**4. Summary of Possible Products**\n\nCombining the outcomes from both possible pathways, we have three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThe reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.

In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two different *ortho* positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to the formation of two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Although a C-D bond is stronger than a C-H bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), this reaction path still occurs. This elimination also results in the loss of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the resulting intermediate is a standard **benzyne** molecule, as the deuterium atom has been removed.\n\n### Step 2: Addition of the Nucleophile to the Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide anion (NH₂⁻), then attacks the highly reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia).\n\n1.  **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This places the amino group (-NH₂) at C1 and creates a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the -NH₂ and -D groups are ortho to each other).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** This places the amino group at C6 and creates a carbanion at C1. Protonation yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the -NH₂ and -D groups are meta to each other).\n\n2.  **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):** The amide ion attacks either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2).\n    *   Regardless of whether the attack is at C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation results in the formation of **aniline** (aminobenzene), a molecule with no deuterium.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the outcomes of both pathways, three unique organic products can be formed:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-Deuterioaniline\n*   3-Deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, and the reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds via a **benzyne** intermediate.\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Benzyne Formation)**: The strong base, amide (NH2-), will abstract a proton (H) or a deuteron (D) from one of the two positions ortho to the bromine atom. This creates two distinct pathways.\n    *   **Pathway A**: Abstraction of the hydrogen (H) from carbon-6. This is the faster reaction and leads to a **deuterated benzyne intermediate**.\n    *   **Pathway B**: Abstraction of the deuterium (D) from carbon-2. This is slower but still possible, leading to a **non-deuterated benzyne intermediate**.\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Product Formation)**: The nucleophile (NH2-) will attack each of the benzyne intermediates. We will analyze the products from each pathway.\n    *   The **deuterated benzyne** can be attacked at two different carbons of the triple bond, leading to two distinct deuterated aniline products.\n    *   The **non-deuterated benzyne** leads to a single, non-deuterated aniline product.\n4.  **Count Unique Products**: We will combine the products from all possible pathways and count the number of unique molecules to find the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this step-by-step reasoning to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 to determine\n    the number of possible organic products.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2/NH3.\")\n    print(\"This reaction proceeds via an elimination-addition (benzyne) mechanism.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Elimination to form benzyne intermediates\n    # The base NH2- can abstract a proton from C6 or a deuteron from C2.\n    print(\"Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\")\n    \n    # Pathway A: H-abstraction from C6\n    # This leads to a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    # The deuterium at C2 is retained on the ring.\n    intermediate_A = \"3-deutero-benzyne\"\n    print(f\"  - Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6) leads to: {intermediate_A}\")\n\n    # Pathway B: D-abstraction from C2\n    # This leads to a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    # The deuterium is removed from the ring.\n    intermediate_B = \"undeuterated benzyne\"\n    print(f\"  - Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2) leads to: {intermediate_B}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Addition of NH2- to the benzyne intermediates\n    print(\"Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition of NH2- to Intermediates\")\n    \n    # Products from Intermediate A (3-deutero-benzyne)\n    # The nucleophile can attack C1 or C6 of the benzyne bond.\n    # Attack at C1 -> Product has NH2 at C1, D at C2 -> 2-deutero-aniline\n    # Attack at C6 -> Product has NH2 at C6, D at C2 -> 3-deutero-aniline\n    products_from_A = {\"2-deutero-aniline\", \"3-deutero-aniline\"}\n    print(f\"  - Products from '{intermediate_A}': {products_from_A}\")\n\n    # Products from Intermediate B (undeuterated benzyne)\n    # Attack at either C1 or C2 of the benzyne gives the same product.\n    products_from_B = {\"aniline\"}\n    print(f\"  - Products from '{intermediate_B}': {products_from_B}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step 3: Count the total number of unique products\n    print(\"Step 3: Counting the Total Unique Products\")\n    all_possible_products = products_from_A.union(products_from_B)\n    number_of_products = len(all_possible_products)\n    \n    print(f\"The complete set of possible organic products is: {all_possible_products}\")\n    print(f\"The total number of possible organic products is: {number_of_products}\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing this to the given choices:\")\n    print(\"A) 1\")\n    print(\"B) 2\")\n    print(\"C) 4\")\n    print(\"D) 3\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct choice is D because there are {number_of_products} possible products.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Analyzing the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2/NH3.\nThis reaction proceeds via an elimination-addition (benzyne) mechanism.\n--------------------------------------------------\nStep 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n  - Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6) leads to: 3-deutero-benzyne\n  - Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2) leads to: undeuterated benzyne\n--------------------------------------------------\nStep 2: Nucleophilic Addition of NH2- to Intermediates\n  - Products from '3-deutero-benzyne': {'3-deutero-aniline', '2-deutero-aniline'}\n  - Products from 'undeuterated benzyne': {'aniline'}\n--------------------------------------------------\nStep 3: Counting the Total Unique Products\nThe complete set of possible organic products is: {'aniline', '3-deutero-aniline', '2-deutero-aniline'}\nThe total number of possible organic products is: 3\n\nComparing this to the given choices:\nA) 1\nB) 2\nC) 4\nD) 3\n\nThe correct choice is D because there are 3 possible products.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring substituted with a bromine (Br) atom at position 1 and a deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen) atom at position 2. The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are occupied by standard hydrogen (H) atoms.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂). This is an extremely strong base. The active species is the amide anion (NH₂⁻).\n    *   **Solvent:** Condensed (liquid) ammonia (NH₃).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base typically proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong base NH₂⁻ abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Br). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n    *   **Position C-2:** This position holds a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   **Position C-6:** This position holds a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The base can abstract either the H from C-6 or the D from C-2. This leads to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6.\n        2.  The electrons from the C6-H bond form a new bond between C-6 and C-1, creating a triple bond.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C-1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne** (if the triple bond is numbered C1-C6, the deuterium is at C3).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. (Note: This is slower than H⁺ abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The electrons from the C2-D bond form a new bond between C-2 and C-1, creating a triple bond.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C-1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the molecule. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\n    So, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃). We must analyze the addition to each intermediate separately.\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deutero-benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate has a triple bond between C-1 and C-6, and a deuterium at C-2.\n        *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-6 of the triple bond. These two atoms are not equivalent because of the deuterium at C-2.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or o-deuteroaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber this molecule so that the -NH₂ group is at C-1, the deuterium is at C-3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline** (or m-deuteroaniline).\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate has a triple bond between C-1 and C-2 and no deuterium.\n        *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-2. Since the benzyne is symmetrical (in the absence of other substituents), both attacks lead to the same product.\n        *   **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** The -NH₂ group attaches to one carbon of the former triple bond, and the other carbon is protonated. The final product has no deuterium. This is simply **aniline**.\n\n### Listing All Possible Products and Careful Points\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two Elimination Pathways:** The presence of both H and D at the ortho positions is the crucial starting point. It means two different elimination pathways must be considered.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):** The C-H bond is broken more easily and quickly than the C-D bond. This means Pathway A is faster than Pathway B, and the deuterated products (2- and 3-deuteroaniline) will be the major products. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must include the product from the slower Pathway B.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Asymmetric Benzyne Addition:** The benzyne intermediate from Pathway A is asymmetric due to the deuterium substituent. Attack by the nucleophile at the two ends of the triple bond leads to two different constitutional isomers (isotopomers).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Symmetric Benzyne Addition:** The benzyne intermediate from Pathway B is symmetric, so attack at either end yields only one product.\n\n### Final Tally of Products\n\nFrom the analysis, we have identified three distinct possible organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia, which is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction proceeding through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a position ortho to the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions: C6 (with a hydrogen atom, H) and C2 (with a deuterium atom, D).\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    *   The NH2- base can abstract the proton (H) from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    *   This abstraction forms a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The subsequent loss of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1 results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    ```\n    (Starting material)             (3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n         Br                                 (triple bond)\n        / \\                                /     \\\n       D---C1                             D---C2--C1\n      / \\ / \\                           /  \\   /\n     H---C6                             H---C3==C6\n      \\ /                                \\  /\n       ...                                ...\n    ```\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    *   Alternatively, the NH2- base can abstract the deuteron (D) from the C2 position. This pathway is possible, although slower than Path A.\n    *   This abstraction forms a carbanion at C2, and the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.\n    *   The subsequent loss of Br- from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed in this process, the resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    ```\n    (Starting material)             (Benzyne intermediate)\n         Br                                 (triple bond)\n        / \\                                /     \\\n       D---C1                             H---C2==C1\n      / \\ / \\                           /  \\   /\n     ...

This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final aniline products.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A)**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2- can attack either C1 or C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1, and a proton (from NH3) adds to C6. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or o-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6, and a proton adds to C1. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. Based on IUPAC naming (where -NH2 defines C1), this is **3-deuteroaniline** (or m-deuteroaniline).\n    *   So, Path A leads to two distinct products.\n\n*   **Addition to Benzyne (from Path B)**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical.

The number of possible organic products can be determined by considering all feasible reaction pathways.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is generally the faster reaction due to the kinetic isotope effect (a C-H bond is broken more easily than a C-D bond). The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 generates a **3-deuterobenzyne** intermediate. In this intermediate, the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at C2.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. Although slower, this pathway is still possible. The removal of the deuteron and the subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 result in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium at C2 was removed, the resulting intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻), acting as a nucleophile, then attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The NH₂⁻ nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.

Let's analyze the specific case of 1-bromobenzene-2-d.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThe bond to hydrogen (C-H) is weaker than the bond to deuterium (C-D). Because of this kinetic isotope effect, it is easier and faster for the base to remove the hydrogen at position 6 than the deuterium at position 2. This leads to two possible competing elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Major Pathway:** The amide ion abstracts the hydrogen from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 creates a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n2.  **Minor Pathway:** Less frequently, the amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion, attacks the reactive \"triple\" bond of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (Major pathway):**\n    *   The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (Minor pathway):**\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate.\n    *   The resulting product is simply **aniline**, containing no deuterium.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nConsidering both the major and minor pathways, three distinct organic products are possible:\n\n1.  2-Deuteroaniline\n2.  3-Deuteroaniline\n3.

To determine the number of possible organic products, we must consider all potential reaction pathways.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH2⁻) from NaNH2, abstracts a proton from a carbon atom ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6**, which holds a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2**, which holds a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, meaning the abstraction of the hydrogen is kinetically favored. This phenomenon is known as the kinetic isotope effect. However, both abstractions are possible and lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C-6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 creates a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains at C-2. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C-2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 results in a benzyne with the triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium is removed, so the intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe newly formed benzyne intermediates are highly reactive and will be attacked by a nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻) in this case.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n    *   Attack at C-1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C-6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    Therefore, Pathway A yields two distinct deuterated products.\n\n*   **Addition to Benzyne (from Pathway B):** The amide ion attacks the symmetrical benzyne intermediate. Attack at either C-1 or C-2 yields the same product after protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n    *   This pathway leads to the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    Therefore, Pathway B yields one non-deuterated product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find a total of three different organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  2-Deuteroaniline\n2.  3-Deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   Reactant: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   Reagents: Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   Reaction: The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) from NaNH₂ acts as a strong base and removes a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n    *   Position 2, which holds a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   Position 6, which holds a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of the proton (H) from C-6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D) from C-2. However, both reactions are *possible*. Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates will be formed.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C-6.**\n        1.  NH₂⁻ abstracts H⁺ from C-6, forming a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion intermediate loses a bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains at C-2. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C-2.**\n        1.  NH₂⁻ abstracts D⁺ from C-2.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion loses a bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom has been removed. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia, NH₃) to give the final aniline product.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        The intermediate, 3-deuteriobenzyne, has a triple bond between C-1 and C-6 and a deuterium at C-2. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-6.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** NH₂ group attaches to C-1. The resulting carbanion at C-6 is protonated by NH₃. The product is 1-amino-2-deuteriobenzene, also known as **2-deuterioaniline** (or *ortho*-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** NH₂ group attaches to C-6. The resulting carbanion at C-1 is protonated. In the final product, the NH₂ group is at position 1 (by convention), and the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline** (or *meta*-deuterioaniline).\n        Therefore, the major pathway leads to *two* distinct organic products.\n\n    *   **Product from Pathway B (via benzyne):**\n        The intermediate is a symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne. Attack by NH₂⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, yields the same product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n        Therefore, the minor pathway leads to *one* additional distinct organic product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\n    By considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three chemically distinct organic products:\n    1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Path A)\n    2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Path A)\n    3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\n    These three molecules are all possible products of the reaction. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This set of reactants and conditions points to an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the substrate and the reaction.**\n*   Substrate: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where C1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br) and the adjacent carbon, C2, is attached to a deuterium atom (D). All other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   Reagent: NaNH2 in NH3. Sodium amide is a very strong base. The amide ion (NH2-) is the active species.\n*   Reaction type: Elimination-Addition via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination).**\nThe strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n1.  **C2**, which bears a deuterium (D).\n2.  **C6**, which bears a hydrogen (H).\n\nThe base can abstract from either position, leading to two different pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6.**\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of a proton (H+) from C6 is significantly faster than the abstraction of a deuteron (D+) from C2. This is therefore the major reaction pathway.\n    1.  NH2- removes H+ from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    3.  This results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2.**\n    Although slower, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is still a possible reaction.\n    1.  NH2- removes D+ from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The original deuterium atom is removed from the molecule during this process. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition).**\nThe amide ion (NH2-), acting as a nucleophile, attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation (by the solvent, NH3) of the resulting carbanion to yield the final aniline product(s).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The NH2- nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6. These two carbons are not equivalent.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** This forms a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion gives **2-deuterioaniline** (or o-deuterioaniline).\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** This forms a carbanion at C1. Protonation of this carbanion gives **3-deuterioaniline** (or m-deuterioaniline).\n    Since both modes of attack are possible, Pathway A leads to **two** different organic products.\n\n*   **Attack on benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2. The intermediate is symmetrical.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 (or C2):** The attack of NH2- at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2). The deuterium is not present in this product because it was removed in the first step of this pathway.\n    Pathway B leads to **one** organic product.\n\n**Step 4: Count the total number of unique organic products.**\nCombining the products from both possible pathways:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nThese three molecules (aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline) are structurally distinct compounds. Therefore, there are a total of three possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe user wants to find the number of possible organic products from the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide in liquid ammonia.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂) is a classic example of an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In the starting molecule, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both elimination pathways, even though the removal of H is kinetically favored over the removal of D (due to the kinetic isotope effect).\n\n*   **Pathway A: Removal of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton from C6.\n    2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C6, ejecting the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step. The intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Removal of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2.\n    2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C2, ejecting the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe nucleophile (another amide ion, NH₂⁻) attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical due to the deuterium at C2. The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond, leading to two distinct products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. After protonation of the carbanion at C6, the product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. After protonation of the carbanion at C1, the product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond leads to the same product after protonation.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The -NH₂ group adds, and the product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products can be formed:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.

The amide ion (NH2-), a strong base, initiates the reaction by removing a proton or deuteron from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom.\n\nIn the case of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two possible sites for this initial abstraction:\n1.  **Removal of a hydrogen atom (H) from C6:** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, making this the kinetically favored pathway. This elimination of H from C6 and Br from C1 results in an intermediate called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Removal of a deuterium atom (D) from C2:** While slower due to the stronger C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), this pathway is still possible. This elimination removes the deuterium atom entirely, leading to a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nOnce these two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed, the amide ion (NH2-), acting as a nucleophile, attacks them. This leads to the formation of different products:\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne:** The amide ion can attack either of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond.\n    *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n*   **Attack on the non-deuterated benzyne:** The amide ion attacks the symmetrical benzyne intermediate, and after protonation by the ammonia solvent, the sole product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, combining the outcomes of both possible initial steps, a total of three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-deuteroaniline\n*   3-deuteroaniline\n\nThis makes for a total of three possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of an aromatic nucleophilic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D), a stable isotope of hydrogen.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible and lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **H-abstraction (major pathway):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **D-abstraction (minor pathway):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive \"triple\" bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Addition to 3-Deuterobenzyne:**\nThis intermediate is asymmetrical. The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n*   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C1. After protonation, the final product has the amino group at position 1 and the deuterium at position 2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n*   **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6. After protonation, the final product has the amino group at position 6 (which is renumbered to 1 for nomenclature) and the deuterium at position 2 relative to the original bromine, which becomes position 3 relative to the new amino group. This is **3-deuteroaniline** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n\n**Addition to Non-deuterated Benzyne:**\nThis intermediate is symmetrical. Attack of the amide ion at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to a single product.\n*   The product is simple **aniline**, with no deuterium.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the outcomes from both pathways, a total of three distinct organic products are formed in this reaction:\n1.

The number of possible products is determined by the different pathways the reaction can take.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Elimination and Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nSodium amide is a very strong base that can remove a proton (or deuteron) from a position adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n1.  **Removal of Deuterium (D) from C2:** The amide ion can remove the deuterium atom at the C2 position.\n2.  **Removal of Hydrogen (H) from C6:** The amide ion can also remove the hydrogen atom at the C6 position.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking the weaker C-H bond is faster than breaking the stronger C-D bond. However, both eliminations occur, leading to the formation of two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n*   **Benzyne A (from D removal):** This intermediate has no deuterium and possesses a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n*   **Benzyne B (from H removal):** This intermediate still contains the deuterium atom at C2, with the triple bond located between C1 and C6.\n\n**Step 2: Addition and Formation of Final Products**\n\nThe nucleophile in the reaction, the amide ion (NH2-), attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. This can happen at either carbon of the triple bond.\n\n*   **Reaction of Benzyne A:** Attack by the amide ion at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, leads to the formation of a single product:\n    *   **Product 1: Aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n*   **Reaction of Benzyne B (3-deuterobenzyne):** This deuterated intermediate can be attacked at two different positions:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amide ion adds to C1. Subsequent protonation yields **2-deuterioaniline** (ortho-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amide ion adds to C6. Subsequent protonation yields **3-deuterioaniline** (meta-deuterioaniline).\n\nIn total, the reaction produces three different organic molecules: aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
