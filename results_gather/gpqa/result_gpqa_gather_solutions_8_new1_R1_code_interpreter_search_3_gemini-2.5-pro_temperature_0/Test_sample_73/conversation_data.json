A key feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed.\n\nTherefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. The problem is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\nLet's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:**\n    The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant for this type of atom.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Value:**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    The probability of decay is `1 - P_survival`.\n    So, `P_decay(100) = 1 - P_survival(100) = 0.32`\n    This means the probability of surviving for 100 minutes is:\n    `P_survival(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    From the formula in step 1, we have:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in a 150-minute interval. This is `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n4.  **Relate the Probabilities:**\n    We can express `e^(-λ * 150)` in terms of the known value `e^(-λ * 100)`.\n    Notice that `150 = 100 * 1.5`. So, we can write:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Substituting the value from step 2:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now, we calculate the value of `(0.68)^1.5`:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n    This is the probability of the atom surviving for 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of it decaying within 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n    This probability is 43.93%, which is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem is about the probability of radioactive decay, a process that is fundamentally \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\nTo solve this, we first need to determine the decay constant (λ), which represents the probability that a single nucleus will decay per unit of time. The probability `P` that an atom will decay within a time `t` is given by the formula for exponential decay:\n\n*P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)*\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find λ:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nNow, we can solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nNow we can use this decay constant to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes. As mentioned, due to the memoryless property, this is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)*\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)*\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))*\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))*\n\nSince `e^ln(x) = x`:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5*\n\nNow, we calculate the value:\n\n0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we find the probability:\n\n*P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393*\n\nThis probability of approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%, is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that an atom has *not* decayed by time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = exp(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability that it *has* decayed by time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - exp(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Find the Decay Constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).

The probability of decay is constant over time, which means the process follows an exponential distribution. A crucial characteristic of the exponential distribution is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n2.  **The \"Memoryless\" Property:**\n    This property means that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of its past history. In this context, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is not affected by the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes. The atom doesn't \"age\" or get \"tired\". Its chance of decaying in any given second is always the same. Therefore, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a newly formed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Define the Decay Probability Function:**\n    Let P(t) be the probability that the atom decays within a time interval of length `t`. The survival probability, S(t), is the probability it has *not* decayed by time `t`.\n    *   P(t) = 1 - S(t)\n    The survival probability for exponential decay is given by the formula:\n    *   S(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    So, the decay probability is:\n    *   P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom:**\n    We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   P(100) = 0.32\n    This means the survival probability for 100 minutes is:\n    *   S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n    Using the survival formula:\n    *   e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As established by the memoryless property, this is equivalent to calculating P(150) for a new atom.\n    *   P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n    We can find the value of e^(-150λ) using the information from the previous step. We can express -150λ as (-100λ) * 1.5.\n    *   e^(-150λ) = e^((-100λ) * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n    Now, substitute the value we found for e^(-100λ):\n    *   e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   (0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68\n    *   √0.68 ≈ 0.8246\n    *   (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n    Now, calculate the final decay probability:\n    *   P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to the given option of 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Memoryless Property:** This is the most critical point. Forgetting this would lead to incorrect calculations involving conditional probability that are unnecessarily complex and might lead to errors if not handled carefully. The fact that 50 minutes have passed is extraneous information.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability:** Be careful to distinguish between the probability of decay (P(t)) and the probability of survival (S(t)). The exponential formula e^(-λt) directly gives the survival probability.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The calculation relies on correctly manipulating the exponents (e.g., e^(a*b) = (e^a)^b) to avoid explicitly calculating the decay constant λ, which simplifies the arithmetic and reduces rounding errors.\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem involves the concept of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n### **Reasoning**\n\n1.  **The Memoryless Property:** The most crucial concept here is that radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\" or become \"more likely\" to decay just because it has survived for a while. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no bearing on its future decay probability.\n\n2.  **Simplifying the Question:** Because of the memoryless property, the question \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes?\" is equivalent to the simpler question: \"What is the probability a new atom will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Mathematical Formulation:**\n    *   Let `P(t)` be the probability that the atom decays within time `t`. The formula for this is `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of survival beyond time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Using the Given Data:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can find the survival probability for 100 minutes: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-λ * 150)` using the value we found in the previous step:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting the known value:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Now, we can calculate the final probability:\n        `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Computation:**\n    *   Calculating `(0.68)^1.5` gives approximately `0.5607`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n    *   This probability, `0.4393`, is equal to `43.93%`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated probability is 43.93%, which is closest to the answer choice 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe defining characteristic of radioactive decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes has no bearing on its future decay probability.\n\nWe can solve this problem by first calculating the decay constant (λ) from the information provided and then using it to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\n### 1.

The probability of decay depends only on the length of the time interval.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the decay constant (λ) from the information given. The probability that an atom survives for a time *t* is given by the formula P(survival) = e^(-λt).\n\n1.  **Use the given data to find the decay constant (λ):**\n    *   The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   This means the probability of the atom *not* decaying (surviving) within 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    *   Using the survival formula: 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100).\n    *   To solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.68) = -100λ.\n    *   So, λ = -ln(0.68) / 100.\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:**\n    *   Because the process is memoryless, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant.

Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nBecause of the memoryless property, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom would decay in 150 minutes. We need to calculate P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e⁻ˡ⁽¹⁵⁰⁾.\n\nWe can find the value of e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ from the value of e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ we found earlier:\n\n*   e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ = (e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ)¹·⁵\n*   e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ = (0.68)¹·⁵\n\nNow, we calculate the value of (0.68)¹·⁵:\n\n*   (0.68)¹·⁵ ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of decay:\n\n*   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607\n*   P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393\n\n### 4.

The problem is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\nLet's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:**\n    The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant for this type of atom.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Value:**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    The probability of decay is `1 - P_survival`.\n    So, `P_decay(100) = 1 - P_survival(100) = 0.32`\n    This means the probability of surviving for 100 minutes is:\n    `P_survival(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    From the formula in step 1, we have:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in a 150-minute interval.

So, we can write:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Substituting the value from step 2:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now, we calculate the value of `(0.68)^1.5`:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n    This is the probability of the atom surviving for 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of it decaying within 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n    This probability is 43.93%, which is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem is about the probability of radioactive decay, a process that is fundamentally \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\nTo solve this, we first need to determine the decay constant (λ), which represents the probability that a single nucleus will decay per unit of time. The probability `P` that an atom will decay within a time `t` is given by the formula for exponential decay:\n\n*P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)*\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find λ:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nNow, we can solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nNow we can use this decay constant to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes. As mentioned, due to the memoryless property, this is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)*\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)*\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))*\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))*\n\nSince `e^ln(x) = x`:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5*\n\nNow, we calculate the value:\n\n0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we find the probability:\n\n*P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393*\n\nThis probability of approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%, is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that an atom has *not* decayed by time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = exp(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability that it *has* decayed by time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - exp(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Find the Decay Constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).

The probability of decay is constant over time, which means the process follows an exponential distribution. A crucial characteristic of the exponential distribution is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n2.  **The \"Memoryless\" Property:**\n    This property means that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of its past history. In this context, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is not affected by the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes. The atom doesn't \"age\" or get \"tired\". Its chance of decaying in any given second is always the same. Therefore, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a newly formed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Define the Decay Probability Function:**\n    Let P(t) be the probability that the atom decays within a time interval of length `t`. The survival probability, S(t), is the probability it has *not* decayed by time `t`.\n    *   P(t) = 1 - S(t)\n    The survival probability for exponential decay is given by the formula:\n    *   S(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    So, the decay probability is:\n    *   P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom:**\n    We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   P(100) = 0.32\n    This means the survival probability for 100 minutes is:\n    *   S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n    Using the survival formula:\n    *   e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As established by the memoryless property, this is equivalent to calculating P(150) for a new atom.\n    *   P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n    We can find the value of e^(-150λ) using the information from the previous step. We can express -150λ as (-100λ) * 1.5.\n    *   e^(-150λ) = e^((-100λ) * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n    Now, substitute the value we found for e^(-100λ):\n    *   e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   (0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68\n    *   √0.68 ≈ 0.8246\n    *   (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n    Now, calculate the final decay probability:\n    *   P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to the given option of 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Memoryless Property:** This is the most critical point. Forgetting this would lead to incorrect calculations involving conditional probability that are unnecessarily complex and might lead to errors if not handled carefully. The fact that 50 minutes have passed is extraneous information.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability:** Be careful to distinguish between the probability of decay (P(t)) and the probability of survival (S(t)). The exponential formula e^(-λt) directly gives the survival probability.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The calculation relies on correctly manipulating the exponents (e.g., e^(a*b) = (e^a)^b) to avoid explicitly calculating the decay constant λ, which simplifies the arithmetic and reduces rounding errors.\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem involves the concept of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n### **Reasoning**\n\n1.  **The Memoryless Property:** The most crucial concept here is that radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed.

We can use this information to find the decay constant `λ`.\n\n*   P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32\n*   1 - e⁻ˡ⁽¹⁰⁰⁾ = 0.32\n*   e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ = 1 - 0.32\n*   e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ = 0.68\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nBecause of the memoryless property, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom would decay in 150 minutes. We need to calculate P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e⁻ˡ⁽¹⁵⁰⁾.\n\nWe can find the value of e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ from the value of e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ we found earlier:\n\n*   e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ = (e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ)¹·⁵\n*   e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ = (0.68)¹·⁵\n\nNow, we calculate the value of (0.68)¹·⁵:\n\n*   (0.68)¹·⁵ ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of decay:\n\n*   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607\n*   P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
