Understand the Decay Process**\n\nThe decay is given by:\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu$\n\nThe initial particle, the positive pion ($\\pi^+$), is stationary.

Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nWe will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**a) Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n*   Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$): Since the pion is at rest, its energy is its rest energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   Final Energy ($E_{final}$): The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$). The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy (KE).\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n    $E_{final} = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2 + KE_{\\mu^+}) + (m_{\\nu_\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\nu_\\mu})$\n\n*   Equating initial and final energies:\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2 + KE_{\\mu^+}) + (m_{\\nu_\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\nu_\\mu})$\n    $139.6 \\text{ MeV} = (105.7 \\text{ MeV} + KE_{\\mu^+}) + (0 + KE_{\\nu_\\mu})$\n    $139.6 = 105.7 + KE_{\\mu^+} + KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n\n*   The total kinetic energy of the products is:\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} + KE_{\\nu_\\mu} = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**b) Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n*   Initial Momentum ($\\vec{p}_{initial}$): Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n    $\\vec{p}_{initial} = 0$\n\n*   Final Momentum ($\\vec{p}_{final}$): The final momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n\n*   Equating initial and final momenta:\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu_\\mu} = 0$\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu_\\mu}| = p$\n\n**4. Calculate the Momentum and Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, we know that for the massless neutrino, its energy is $E_{\\nu_\\mu} = pc$.\nSo, $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu_\\mu} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc$.\n\nNow, apply the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n$E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $E_{\\mu^+}$:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nExpand the left side:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nCancel the $(pc)^2$ term from both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nRearrange to solve for pc:\n$2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\nPlug in the given values:\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n$pc = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n$pc = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energies:\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$):**\n    For a massless particle, $KE = E = pc$.\n    $KE_{\\nu_\\mu} = 29.78 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):**\n    We can use the total kinetic energy we found earlier.\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = (KE_{total}) - KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nSo, the kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon ($\\mu^+$) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$).\n\nComparing this with the options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nMy initial calculation is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Calculation Steps:** The problem involves a two-body decay of a stationary particle. The key principles are the conservation of energy and momentum.\n    1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (π⁺) is at rest, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the final products, the muon (μ⁺) and the muon neutrino (ν), must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's call the magnitude of this momentum 'p'.\n    2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion (E_π = m_πc²). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n    3.  **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where m₀ is the rest mass.\n        *   For the muon: E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc²\n        *   For the neutrino, its rest mass is considered to be zero. Therefore, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, and E_ν = pc = KE_ν.\n\n*   **Solving for Kinetic Energies:**\n    1.  From energy conservation: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    2.  We can write E_μ as m_πc² - E_ν.\n    3.  Using the relativistic energy formula for the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)².\n    4.  Substitute the expressions for E_μ and pc: (m_πc² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)².\n    5.  Expanding and solving for E_ν (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy, KE_ν):\n        (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n        KE_ν = E_ν = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n    6.  Plugging in the given values:\n        KE_ν = [(139.6 MeV)² - (105.7 MeV)²] / [2 * 139.6 MeV]\n        KE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n        KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n    7.  Now, find the muon's kinetic energy (KE_μ) using energy conservation:\n        KE_μ = m_πc² - m_μc² - KE_ν\n        KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. Search results confirm these values, with one source calculating the muon kinetic energy to be 4.12 MeV and the neutrino kinetic energy to be 29.65 MeV. Another source states the muon kinetic energy is 4.13 MeV. These minor differences are due to slightly different values used for the rest masses of the particles. The values match option B most closely.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon (μ⁺): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino (ν): **29.8 MeV**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (pion, $\\pi^+$) into two other particles (muon, $\\mu^+$ and a neutrino, $\\nu$). This process must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the particles involved are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu}$ (where p is the magnitude of momentum).\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$). The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).\n    *   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino, we assume its rest mass is zero ($m_{\\nu} = 0$), so its energy is simply $E_{\\nu} = p_{\\nu}c$. The kinetic energy of a massless particle is its total energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu}$.\n\n4.  **Solve for Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   From momentum conservation and the neutrino's energy, we have $p_{\\mu}c = p_{\\nu}c = E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Substitute this into the energy conservation equation:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(KE_{\\nu})^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + KE_{\\nu}$\n    *   Rearranging and squaring this equation allows us to solve for the neutrino's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\nu}$):\n        $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n    *   Once we find $KE_{\\nu}$, we can find the muon's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\mu}$) using the total kinetic energy released in the decay (the Q-value):\n        $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n        $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$\n\n5.  **Python Implementation:** The following Python code will perform these calculations using the given rest mass values.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of Pi(+) in MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of mu(+) in MeV\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# Formula: KE_nu = (m_pi_c2^2 - m_mu_c2^2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n# Q = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE_mu = Q - KE_nu\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"B) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"C) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\")\n\n# Determine the correct option\nif abs(ke_mu - 4.12) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 29.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"A\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 3.52) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 20.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"B\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 7.2) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 32.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"C\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 2.84) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 26.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"D\"\nelse:\n    correct_option = \"None of the above\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated values match option {correct_option}.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: 4.12 MeV\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: 29.78 MeV\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option None of the above.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Decay Process and Conservation Laws**\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$). The reaction is:\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\nSince the pion is initially at rest, this decay must obey two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Assumptions**\n*   Initial particle: Pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Rest mass energy of muon ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV.\n*   **Assumption:** The neutrino ($\\nu$) is considered massless. Its rest mass energy ($m_{\\nu}c^2$) is 0. This is a standard and valid approximation for this type of problem.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n*   **Initial Momentum:** Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum ($p_{\\pi}$) is zero.\n*   **Final Momentum:** After the decay, the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Let their momenta be $\\vec{p}_{\\mu}$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n*   **Equation:**\n    $p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n    $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    This implies that their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total energy of the stationary pion is just its rest mass energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$). We must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (0)^2} = p_{\\nu}c$\n*   **Equation:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    Substituting the expressions for energy and using $p_{\\mu}c = p_{\\nu}c = pc$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**5. Solve for the Momentum (pc)**\nWe need to solve the energy conservation equation for the momentum magnitude `p` (or more conveniently, `pc`).\n1.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the square root term:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n2.  Square both sides of the equation:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}\\right)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n3.  The $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n4.  Solve for `pc`:\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6.

Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\nThe kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy ($KE = E - mc^2$).\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its rest energy is zero. Its total energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 = pc - 0 = pc$\n    $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n    Rounding to one decimal place gives **29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    We can find this using the total energy released in the decay (the Q-value). The initial mass energy is converted into the final rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy of the products.\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 4.12$ MeV\n\n**8.

Since the speeds of the product particles can be a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the products must also be zero.\n$\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\nThis means the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$) must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n$|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Solving for Momentum and Energies**\n\nWe can now solve this equation for the momentum term `pc`.\n1.  Rearrange the equation:\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n2.  Square both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n3.  Simplify by canceling the $(pc)^2$ term:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n4.

Now, substitute this into the relativistic energy-momentum equation for the muon:\n    *   (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n    *   pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n5.  **Calculating the Values**:\n    *   pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    *   pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n    *   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2\n    *   pc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n6.  **Finding the Kinetic Energies**:\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν)**: Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its momentum multiplied by c.\n        *   KE_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ)**: We can find this by subtracting the other energies from the initial energy.\n        *   KE_μ = m_πc² - m_μc² - KE_ν\n        *   KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n        *   KE_μ = 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.

Let the magnitude of the momentum of each product particle be `p`.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion.

Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu_\\mu}| = p$\n\n**4. Calculate the Momentum and Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, we know that for the massless neutrino, its energy is $E_{\\nu_\\mu} = pc$.\nSo, $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu_\\mu} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc$.\n\nNow, apply the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n$E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $E_{\\mu^+}$:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nExpand the left side:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nCancel the $(pc)^2$ term from both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nRearrange to solve for pc:\n$2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\nPlug in the given values:\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n$pc = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n$pc = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energies:\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$):**\n    For a massless particle, $KE = E = pc$.\n    $KE_{\\nu_\\mu} = 29.78 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):**\n    We can use the total kinetic energy we found earlier.\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = (KE_{total}) - KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nSo, the kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon ($\\mu^+$) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$).\n\nComparing this with the options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nMy initial calculation is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Calculation Steps:** The problem involves a two-body decay of a stationary particle. The key principles are the conservation of energy and momentum.\n    1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (π⁺) is at rest, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the final products, the muon (μ⁺) and the muon neutrino (ν), must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's call the magnitude of this momentum 'p'.\n    2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion (E_π = m_πc²). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n    3.  **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where m₀ is the rest mass.\n        *   For the muon: E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc²\n        *   For the neutrino, its rest mass is considered to be zero. Therefore, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, and E_ν = pc = KE_ν.\n\n*   **Solving for Kinetic Energies:**\n    1.  From energy conservation: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    2.  We can write E_μ as m_πc² - E_ν.\n    3.  Using the relativistic energy formula for the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)².\n    4.  Substitute the expressions for E_μ and pc: (m_πc² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)².\n    5.  Expanding and solving for E_ν (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy, KE_ν):\n        (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n        KE_ν = E_ν = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n    6.  Plugging in the given values:\n        KE_ν = [(139.6 MeV)² - (105.7 MeV)²] / [2 * 139.6 MeV]\n        KE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n        KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n    7.  Now, find the muon's kinetic energy (KE_μ) using energy conservation:\n        KE_μ = m_πc² - m_μc² - KE_ν\n        KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. Search results confirm these values, with one source calculating the muon kinetic energy to be 4.12 MeV and the neutrino kinetic energy to be 29.65 MeV. Another source states the muon kinetic energy is 4.13 MeV. These minor differences are due to slightly different values used for the rest masses of the particles. The values match option B most closely.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon (μ⁺): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino (ν): **29.8 MeV**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (pion, $\\pi^+$) into two other particles (muon, $\\mu^+$ and a neutrino, $\\nu$). This process must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the particles involved are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu}$ (where p is the magnitude of momentum).\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$). The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).\n    *   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino, we assume its rest mass is zero ($m_{\\nu} = 0$), so its energy is simply $E_{\\nu} = p_{\\nu}c$. The kinetic energy of a massless particle is its total energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu}$.\n\n4.  **Solve for Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   From momentum conservation and the neutrino's energy, we have $p_{\\mu}c = p_{\\nu}c = E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Substitute this into the energy conservation equation:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(KE_{\\nu})^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + KE_{\\nu}$\n    *   Rearranging and squaring this equation allows us to solve for the neutrino's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\nu}$):\n        $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n    *   Once we find $KE_{\\nu}$, we can find the muon's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\mu}$) using the total kinetic energy released in the decay (the Q-value):\n        $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n        $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$\n\n5.  **Python Implementation:** The following Python code will perform these calculations using the given rest mass values.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of Pi(+) in MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of mu(+) in MeV\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# Formula: KE_nu = (m_pi_c2^2 - m_mu_c2^2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n# Q = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE_mu = Q - KE_nu\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"B) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"C) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\")\n\n# Determine the correct option\nif abs(ke_mu - 4.12) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 29.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"A\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 3.52) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 20.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"B\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 7.2) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 32.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"C\"\nelif abs(ke_mu - 2.84) < 0.01 and abs(ke_nu - 26.8) < 0.01:\n    correct_option = \"D\"\nelse:\n    correct_option = \"None of the above\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated values match option {correct_option}.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: 4.12 MeV\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: 29.78 MeV\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option None of the above.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Decay Process and Conservation Laws**\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$). The reaction is:\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\nSince the pion is initially at rest, this decay must obey two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Assumptions**\n*   Initial particle: Pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Rest mass energy of muon ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV.\n*   **Assumption:** The neutrino ($\\nu$) is considered massless. Its rest mass energy ($m_{\\nu}c^2$) is 0. This is a standard and valid approximation for this type of problem.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n*   **Initial Momentum:** Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum ($p_{\\pi}$) is zero.\n*   **Final Momentum:** After the decay, the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Let their momenta be $\\vec{p}_{\\mu}$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n*   **Equation:**\n    $p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n    $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    This implies that their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total energy of the stationary pion is just its rest mass energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).

The $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n4.  Solve for `pc`:\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6.

Since the speeds of the product particles can be a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the products must also be zero.\n$\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\nThis means the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$) must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.
