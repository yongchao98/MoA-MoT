Initial State and Governing Principles\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can deduce its quantum numbers:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0` (since `2S+1 = 1`).\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S').\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0').\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Governing Principles for the Decay:** The decay `1S0 -> NN(final) + X` must satisfy the following conditions:\n    1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`(-1)^L_f`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`-1`), and the orbital parity of X (`(-1)^l_X`).\n        *   `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n        *   For `P_f` to equal `+1`, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even. This means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics:** The problem provides the rule for the final NN state with isospin `T_f = 0`: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n    4.  **Physicality of the State:** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be 0 or 1. A state with any other spin value is unphysical.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe will now test each option against these four conditions.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`) | Particle X (`l_X`) | 1. Physical State? (`S_f`=0 or 1) | 2. `S_f + L_f` odd? (Pauli) | 3. `L_f + l_X` odd? (Parity) | 4. `J_f = l_X`? (Ang. Mom.) | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A) | `7D1` (`S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1`) | `p` (`l_X=1`) | **No** (`S_f=3`) | `3+2=5` (Yes) | `2+1=3` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | **No** |\n| B) | `3S1` (`S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1`) | `p` (`l_X=1`) | Yes | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0+1=1` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | Yes |\n| C) | `3P0` (`S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0`) | `s` (`l_X=0`) | Yes | `1+1=2` (**No**) | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0=0` (Yes) | **No** |\n| D) | `3D3` (`S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3`) | `f` (`l_X=3`) | Yes | `1+2=3` (Yes) | `2+3=5` (Yes) | `3=3` (Yes) | Yes |\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nOur analysis reveals that two of the proposed transitions are not permitted:\n\n*   **A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p:** This transition is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires a total spin of `S=3`, which is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons.\n*   **C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s:** This transition is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided for a final state with `T=0`. The sum `S_f + L_f` is 2 (even), but the rule requires it to be odd.\n\nThe question asks for a single answer and explicitly directs to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the given Pauli statistics rule. Option C is forbidden precisely because it violates this Pauli rule, while satisfying the conservation laws. Option A is forbidden for a more fundamental reason (the state is non-existent) that is not one of the transition rules explicitly listed. Therefore, the question is most directly answered by identifying the violation of the provided rules.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must analyze each proposed transition against the laws of conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle as specified for the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### **1. Initial State and Selection Rules**\n\nFirst, we establish the properties of the initial state and the rules governing the transition.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`)**:\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0` (since `2S+1 = 1`).\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S').\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0').\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Selection Rules for the Transition**:\n    The decay `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X` must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n    1.  **Pauli Statistics (as given)**: The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)` must hold. Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that the sum **`S(NN) + L(NN)` must be an odd number**.\n\n    2.  **Parity Conservation**: The total parity must be conserved (`P_initial = P_final`).\n        *   `P_initial = +1`.\n        *   The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`(-1)^L(NN)`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`-1`), and the parity of the relative orbital motion (`(-1)^l`, where `l` is the angular momentum of X).\n        *   `P_final = (-1)^L(NN) * (-1) * (-1)^l = (-1)^(L(NN) + l + 1)`.\n        *   For `P_final` to equal `+1`, the exponent `L(NN) + l + 1` must be even. This means **`L(NN) + l` must be an odd number**.\n\n    3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum must be conserved (`J_initial = J_final`).\n        *   `J_initial = 0`.\n        *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum `J(NN)` and the particle X's angular momentum `l` (assuming X is spinless).\n        *   For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: **`J(NN) = l`**.\n\n    4.  **Physicality of the NN State**: A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S(NN)` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other value is unphysical.\n\n### **2. Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe now test each option against these four rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S(NN)=1`, `L(NN)=0`, `J(NN)=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l=1`. `J=l`. **OK.**\n4.  **Physicality:** `S=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S(NN)=1`, `L(NN)=1`, `J(NN)=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATION.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=0`, `l=0`. `J=l`. **OK.**\n4.  **Physicality:** `S=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics rule for the final state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S(NN)=3`. `L(NN)=2`, `J(NN)=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 3+2 = 5` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l = 2+1 = 3` (odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l=1`. `J=l`. OK.\n4.  **Physicality:** `S=3`. **VIOLATION.** A spin of S=3 is impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S(NN)=1`, `L(NN)=2`, `J(NN)=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=3`, `l=3`. `J=l`. **OK.**\n4.  **Physicality:** `S=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth options (B) and (C) describe forbidden transitions, but for different reasons:\n*   **(C) is forbidden** because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons.\n*   **(B) is forbidden** because the transition violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule given in the problem for a `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question asks to identify the non-permitted wave by making use of the specified conservation laws and the Pauli statistics rule. Option (B) is the one that is directly ruled out by an explicit application of the Pauli rule provided in the prompt. The issue with option (C) is more fundamental to the nature of the state itself, rather than the dynamics of the transition. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the specific test laid out in the question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine its quantum numbers:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0` (since `2S+1 = 1`).\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S').\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0').\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Decay Process:** The system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T_f = 0`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions derived from conservation laws and the Pauli principle.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n    **`J_f = l_X`**\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    Setting `P_i = P_f`: `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number. Therefore:\n    **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem explicitly states that for the final NN state with `T_f = 0`, the rule `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)` must hold.\n    Substituting `T_f = 0`: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. Therefore:\n    **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S_f` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a different total spin is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation (`J_f = l_X`):** `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` is odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` is odd):** `1 + 1 = 2`. This is even. **(VIOLATION)**\n4.  **Physicality (`S_f` is 0 or 1):** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics rule for a T=0 final state.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation (`J_f = l_X`):** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` is odd):** `2 + 1 = 3`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` is odd):** `3 + 2 = 5`. (OK)\n4.  **Physicality (`S_f` is 0 or 1):** `S_f=3`. **(VIOLATION)**\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation (`J_f = l_X`):** `1 = 1`.

(OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation (`J_f = l_X`):** `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` is odd):** `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` is odd):** `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n4.  **Physicality (`S_f` is 0 or 1):** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth options A and B describe forbidden transitions.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons.\n*   Option A is forbidden because the transition violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule provided in the problem for a `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave by making use of the provided conservation laws and the Pauli statistics rule. Option A is the one that is directly forbidden by the application of this specific Pauli rule, while satisfying the other conservation laws. The issue with option B is more fundamental (the state cannot exist), but the violation in A is a failure of the *process* selection rules that the question explicitly asks to be used. Therefore, A is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires us to identify a forbidden nuclear transition from a list of possibilities. To do this, we must establish a set of selection rules based on conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle, and then test each option against these rules.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the following quantum numbers:\n*   **Total Spin (S_i):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L_i):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J_i):** The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P_i):** The parity of the NN system is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Selection Rules for the Transition\nThe system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We are given that particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1, and the final NN state has an isospin of `T_f = 0`.\n\n1.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem provides a specific rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Given `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the sum of the final spin and orbital angular momentum, **`S_f + L_f`**, must be **odd**.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`j_X`). Assuming X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion, which also has intrinsic parity -1), its angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`.\n    *   `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   For the sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final total parity.\n    *   `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`\n    *   `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    *   For `P_f` to equal `+1`, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   Therefore, the sum **`L_f + l_X`** must be **odd**.\n\n4.  **Physicality of the NN State:** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. By the rules of angular momentum addition, their total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). Any other value is unphysical.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n3.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Physicality:** `S_f=3`. This **violates** the rule that the total spin of a two-nucleon system can only be 0 or 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). (OK)\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n3.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (OK)\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n3.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\nBoth options A and B describe transitions that are not permitted.\n*   Option A is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule provided in the problem for a final state with `T=0`.\n*   Option B is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the proposed final state `7D1` is unphysical and cannot be formed by two nucleons under any circumstances.\n\nSince the question asks to \"Make use of\" the given conservation laws and the specific Pauli statistics rule, the most likely intended answer is the one that fails this explicit test. The violation in option A is a direct failure to apply the rules governing the transition process itself, which is what the question is about.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. We use the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` to find its quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` -> Total Spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` -> Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` -> Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The system decays via `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions derived from conservation laws and the Pauli principle.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    The problem provides the rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`, we substitute this in:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number. This implies that the sum **`S_f + L_f` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be conserved, so `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   Equating the initial and final parities: `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number, which means **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`l_X`, assuming X is spinless).\n    *   For the vector sum `J_f + l_X` to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. By the rules of angular momentum addition, their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state requiring a different spin value is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules.\n\n| Option | Final State | `l_X` | Rule 1 (`S_f+L_f` odd?) | Rule 2 (`L_f+l_X` odd?) | Rule 3 (`J_f=l_X`?) | Rule 4 (`S_f` valid?) | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **A)** | `3P0` (`S=1, L=1, J=0`) | `s` (0) | `1+1=2` (Even) -> **FAIL** | `1+0=1` (Odd) -> OK | `0=0` -> OK | `S=1` -> OK | **No** |\n| **B)** | `3D3` (`S=1, L=2, J=3`) | `f` (3) | `1+2=3` (Odd) -> OK | `2+3=5` (Odd) -> OK | `3=3` -> OK | `S=1` -> OK | **Yes** |\n| **C)** | `3S1` (`S=1, L=0, J=1`) | `p` (1) | `1+0=1` (Odd) -> OK | `0+1=1` (Odd) -> OK | `1=1` -> OK | `S=1` -> OK | **Yes** |\n| **D)** | `7D1` (`S=3, L=2, J=1`) | `p` (1) | `3+2=5` (Odd) -> OK | `2+1=3` (Odd) -> OK | `1=1` -> OK | `S=3` -> **FAIL** | **No** |\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nOur analysis reveals that two of the options are not permitted:\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics rule given in the problem (`S_f + L_f` is even, but must be odd for a `T=0` final state).\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the proposed final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system (it requires a total spin `S=3`, which is impossible for two spin-1/2 particles).\n\nThe question asks for a single answer and explicitly instructs to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided Pauli statistics rule.\n*   The transition in option D satisfies all three of these explicit rules. It is forbidden for a more fundamental reason not listed in the instructions (the rules of spin addition).\n*   The transition in option A directly violates one of the explicitly provided rules (the Pauli statistics rule).\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is the one that fails the specific tests the question asks you to perform.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) bound system in a `1S0` state. We use the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` to find its quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter 'S' denotes the orbital angular momentum, so `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript '0' denotes the total angular momentum, so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Decay Process:** The initial state decays into a final NN state and a particle X: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T_f = 0`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`, relative to the final NN system.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor the decay to be permitted, it must satisfy several conservation laws and principles.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`j_X`). Assuming X is a spin-0 particle (standard for this notation), `j_X = l_X`. For the total final angular momentum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final total parity.\n    `P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`\n    `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    For `P_final` to equal `+1`, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even. This means:\n    `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    The problem provides the condition for the final `T_f = 0` state: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number, which means:\n    `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a spin multiplicity `2S+1` other than 1 or 3 is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Physicality:** `S_f=3`. This is **not possible** for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` state.\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle selection rule.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth options C and D describe forbidden transitions.\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is unphysical (a two-nucleon system cannot have S=3).\n*   **Option D** is forbidden because the transition violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule given in the problem for a `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question asks to identify the non-permitted wave by making use of the specified conservation laws and the Pauli statistics rule. Option D is the one that is directly forbidden by the application of these rules to the *process* itself. The issue with option C is more fundamental (the state cannot exist at all), but the transition *to* it hypothetically satisfies the selection rules. In the context of testing the application of selection rules, the violation in D is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires us to identify a forbidden nuclear transition by applying conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle. Let's break down the analysis into clear steps.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the following quantum numbers:\n*   **Total Spin (S_i):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L_i):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J_i):** The subscript '0' means `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P_i):** The parity of the NN system is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules for the Transition\nThe transition is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must check each potential final state against three selection rules derived from the problem statement.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the total to remain zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`(-1)^L_f`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`-1`), and the orbital parity of X (`(-1)^l_X`).\n    `P_i = P_f`\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This equation holds only if the exponent is even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem provides the condition for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. A state with S=3 is physically impossible.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` state.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n### Final Decision\nBoth options B and D describe forbidden transitions.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Option D is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule provided in the problem for a `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question asks us to use the provided conservation laws and Pauli statistics rule. The violation in option D is a direct failure to satisfy this specific rule. The violation in option B is due to a more fundamental principle (spin addition) not explicitly listed in the problem's instructions. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the test explicitly laid out in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine its quantum numbers:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0` (since `2S+1 = 1`)\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S')\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0')\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Decay Process:** The system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 2.

This means:\n    `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final State**\n    The problem provides the specific condition for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given that the final state has `T_f = 0`, this becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number, which means:\n    `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles.

Final Decision\nBoth options A and B describe forbidden transitions.\n*   **Option A** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is unphysical; two nucleons cannot form a total spin of S=3.

The violation in option B is a direct failure to apply these given rules for the transition. The violation in option A is due to the state being non-existent, which is a more fundamental issue but one that is not directly tested by the provided transition rules. Therefore, the most likely intended answer is the one that fails the specific tests laid out in the question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine its quantum numbers:\n    *   **Total Spin `S_i`:** `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n    *   **Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i`:** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   **Total Angular Momentum `J_i`:** The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Parity `P_i`:** The parity of the NN system is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions derived from conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`l_X`, assuming X is spinless). For the final total `J` to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    Setting `P_i = P_f`:\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This requires the exponent to be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    The problem explicitly provides the condition for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given that the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the Two-Nucleon State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S_f` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). A state with any other spin value is unphysical.\n\n### 3.

(OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.

Final Decision\n\nBoth options B and C describe forbidden transitions, but for different reasons:\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because the proposed final state, `7D1`, is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons (as their spins can only add up to S=0 or S=1, not S=3). This is a violation of the fundamental rules of spin addition.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the transition violates a specific selection rule for the process. The final state `3P0` can exist, but not with an isospin of T=0, as this violates the Pauli principle (`S_f + L_f` must be odd, but is even).\n\nThe question explicitly asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and provides the specific \"Pauli statistics\" rule. The violation in option B is a direct failure to satisfy this explicitly provided rule governing the transition dynamics. The violation in option C is due to the non-existence of the final state itself. In the context of applying the given rules to the process, option B is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine its quantum numbers:\n    *   **Total Spin `S_i`**: `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n    *   **Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i`**: The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   **Total Angular Momentum `J_i`**: The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Parity `P_i`**: The parity of the NN system is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\nFor the transition to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions based on conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final total parity.\n    `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    Setting `P_i = P_final`:\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\n    This requires `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    The problem provides the specific rule for the final state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Given that the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). A spin multiplicity `2S+1` other than 1 or 3 is unphysical.\n\n### 3.

This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T=0` state. (FAIL)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1` is a valid spin. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1` is a valid spin.

Final Decision\nBoth options B and D describe forbidden transitions, but for different reasons:\n*   **Option D** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is fundamentally impossible to construct with two nucleons.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the process violates a specific selection rule (the Pauli statistics for a T=0 final state) that was explicitly provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe question asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and provides the Pauli statistics rule. The violation in option B is found precisely by applying this specific rule set. The violation in option D is based on a more basic principle of spin addition not explicitly listed in the problem's instructions. Therefore, the question is most directly testing the violation found in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. We can determine its quantum numbers from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the NN system is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules for the Decay\nThe decay `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X` must obey several conservation laws and principles.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's angular momentum (`j_X`). Assuming particle X is spinless (as is standard for this notation), its angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`. For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). The final parity is the product of the parities of all components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X)_intrinsic = -1` (given)\n    *   `P(X)_orbital = (-1)^l_X`\n    Setting `P_i = P_f`:\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This equation holds only if the exponent is even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem provides the condition for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a different total spin is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules. A transition is forbidden if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1` is valid.

(FAIL)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1` is valid.

(OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Final Decision\nBoth options B and C describe forbidden transitions.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Option C is forbidden because the process violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem for a `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the given \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Option C is the one that is forbidden by a direct application of these rules governing the *process*. The issue with option B is the non-existence of the final *state* itself, which is a more fundamental but separate piece of knowledge. In the context of applying the given rules to the proposed transitions, the violation in C is the most direct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.

Establish the Selection Rules for the Decay**\nThe decay process is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must apply conservation laws and the given Pauli principle constraint. Let the final NN state have quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and the emitted particle X have orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem provides the rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Given that the final state has isospin `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   Equating the parities: `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`l_X`, assuming X is spinless).\n    *   For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the Two-Nucleon State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles.

The violation in option A is a direct failure of the explicitly provided Pauli rule. The violation in option D is due to a more fundamental principle of spin addition, which is prerequisite knowledge. In the context of such problems, the intended answer is typically the one that fails the specific, complex rule provided in the question. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must analyze each proposed transition against the laws of conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle as it applies to the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Conservation Rules\n\nFirst, we establish the properties of the initial state and the rules governing the transition.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`)**: The system starts as two nucleons in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we deduce:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the 'S')\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`\n    *   Parity `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1` (even)\n\n*   **Conservation Laws and Principles**: The transition `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X` must obey the following rules:\n    1.  **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n    2.  **Parity Conservation**: The initial parity (`+1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`. For `P_f` to be `+1`, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even. This means **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics (as given)**: For the final NN state with isospin `T_f = 0`, the rule `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)` must hold. Substituting `T_f = 0` gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n    4.  **Physicality of NN States**: A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). Any state with a spin multiplicity `2S_f+1` other than 1 or 3 is unphysical.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe will now test each option against these four conditions. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`) | Particle X (`l_X`) | 1. `J_f = l_X`? | 2. `L_f + l_X` odd? | 3. `S_f + L_f` odd? | 4. `S_f` valid? | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A) `-> 3D3 + f` | `S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3` | `l_X=3` | `3 = 3` (Yes) | `2 + 3 = 5` (Yes) | `1 + 2 = 3` (Yes) | `S_f=1` (Yes) | **Yes** |\n| B) `-> 3S1 + p` | `S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1` | `l_X=1` | `1 = 1` (Yes) | `0 + 1 = 1` (Yes) | `1 + 0 = 1` (Yes) | `S_f=1` (Yes) | **Yes** |\n| C) `-> 3P0 + s` | `S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0` | `l_X=0` | `0 = 0` (Yes) | `1 + 0 = 1` (Yes) | `1 + 1 = 2` (**No**) | `S_f=1` (Yes) | **No** |\n| D) `-> 7D1 + p` | `S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1` | `l_X=1` | `1 = 1` (Yes) | `2 + 1 = 3` (Yes) | `3 + 2 = 5` (Yes) | `S_f=3` (**No**) | **No** |\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals that two of the options are not permitted:\n\n*   **Option C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem. For the final `3P0` state, `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is an even number. The rule for a `T_f=0` final state requires this sum to be odd.\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is not permitted because the proposed final state `7D1` is unphysical. It requires a total spin `S_f=3`, which is impossible to form from two spin-1/2 nucleons.\n\nWhile both transitions are forbidden, they fail for different reasons. The failure in option D is due to the fundamental impossibility of the state itself. The failure in option C is a violation of the specific selection rule governing the dynamics of this particular transition, a rule that was explicitly provided in the problem statement. In physics problems of this nature, one is typically expected to apply the given rules to find the forbidden process. The violation in option C is a direct failure of the Pauli statistics rule that the question instructs the user to apply.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script successfully analyzed the four possible transitions based on the principles of nuclear physics. The code checked each transition against four rules: the physical possibility of the final state, the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state, parity conservation, and angular momentum conservation.\n\nThe output shows that two of the transitions are not permitted:\n\n1.  **Option C: `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**: This transition is forbidden because the final two-nucleon state `7D1` implies a total spin of S=3. A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, the state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n2.  **Option D: `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**: This transition is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided for a final state with isospin T=0. For the final state `3P0`, the spin is S=1 and the orbital angular momentum is L=1. The sum `S+L = 1+1 = 2`, which is an even number. The rule requires `S+L` to be odd for a T=0 final state.\n\nBoth C and D are forbidden transitions. However, the question asks for a single answer and explicitly instructs to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the given Pauli statistics rule. The violation in option D is a direct failure to apply this specific Pauli rule. The violation in option C is more fundamental, as the state itself is impossible, a fact derived from basic spin addition rather than the specific transition rules mentioned. In the context of such problems, the intended answer is typically the one that violates the specific, non-trivial rules provided for the process.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. We use the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)` to extract its quantum numbers:\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules for the Transition\nThe system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must apply the conservation laws and the given Pauli statistics rule to find the conditions for a permitted transition.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`). Assuming particle X is spinless (standard for this type of problem), its angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`. For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). The final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X)_intrinsic = -1` (given)\n    *   `P(X)_orbital = (-1)^l_X`\n    The conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`, which simplifies to `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`. This requires `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which is only true if the exponent is odd.\n    Therefore, `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem explicitly states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)` must hold.\n    Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the Final State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). A state with any other spin value is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any rule.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Rule 4 (Physicality):** `S_f=3` is not possible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-Cons):** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. (OK)\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Rule 4 (Physicality):** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-Cons):** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. (OK)\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   **Rule 4 (Physicality):** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-Cons):** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. (OK)\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Rule 4 (Physicality):** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n### Final Decision\nBoth options A and C describe forbidden transitions.\n*   Option A is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons.\n*   Option C is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule given in the problem for a final state with `T=0`.\n\nThe question asks to identify the non-permitted wave by making use of the specified conservation laws and the Pauli statistics rule. Option C is the one that is forbidden precisely by the application of these explicit rules governing the transition process. The issue with option A is more fundamental to the existence of the state itself, rather than the dynamics of the transition. Therefore, the violation in option C is the most direct answer to the question as posed.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Initial State and the Process\n\nFirst, we must understand the quantum numbers of the initial state and the rules governing the decay.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is a two-nucleon (NN) pair in a `1S0` state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` tells us:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` → Total Spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` → Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` → Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Decay:** The system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 2. Deriving the Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions derived from conservation laws and the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's angular momentum (`j_X`). Assuming particle X is spinless (standard for this notation), `j_X` is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`. For the final total angular momentum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`(-1)^L_f`), the intrinsic parity of X (`-1`), and the parity of the relative orbital motion (`(-1)^l_X`).\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This equation holds only if the exponent is even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics (as given)**\n    The problem provides a specific rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T_f = 0`, this becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state requiring a different total spin is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any rule.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`) | Particle X (`l_X`) | Rule 4 (S valid?) | Rule 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd?) | Rule 2 (`L_f+l_X` odd?) | Rule 1 (`J_f=l_X`?) | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A) `7D1` | `S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1` | `p` (`l_X=1`) | **FAIL** | `3+2=5` (OK) | `2+1=3` (OK) | `1=1` (OK) | **No** |\n| B) `3S1` | `S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1` | `p` (`l_X=1`) | OK | `1+0=1` (OK) | `0+1=1` (OK) | `1=1` (OK) | **Yes** |\n| C) `3P0` | `S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0` | `s` (`l_X=0`) | OK | `1+1=2` (**FAIL**) | `1+0=1` (OK) | `0=0` (OK) | **No** |\n| D) `3D3` | `S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3` | `f` (`l_X=3`) | OK | `1+2=3` (OK) | `2+3=5` (OK) | `3=3` (OK) | **Yes** |\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals that two of the proposed transitions are not permitted:\n\n1.  **Option A (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires a total spin of `S=3`. It is physically impossible to form a spin-3 state from two spin-1/2 nucleons.\n2.  **Option C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem. For the final state `3P0`, `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f + L_f = 2` (even). The rule for a `T=0` final state requires this sum to be odd.\n\nSince the question asks for a single answer, we must determine which violation is the intended focus. The question explicitly instructs the solver to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and provides the specific Pauli statistics formula. Option C is forbidden precisely because it fails to satisfy this explicit formula. The issue with Option A is more fundamental (the state is non-existent) but relies on knowledge not directly enumerated in the problem's instructions. In the context of a physics problem, the intended answer is typically the one that tests the specific, and often more complex, rules provided.\n\nTherefore, the transition that is not permitted based on the rules given is `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the nuclear transition is required, carefully applying all the given physical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial system is a two-nucleon (NN) bound state described by the term symbol `1S0`. The notation `(2S+1)L(J)` allows us to extract its quantum numbers:\n*   **Total Spin (S_i):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L_i):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J_i):** The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P_i):** The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Selection Rules for the Decay\n\nThe decay process is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. For this transition to be allowed, it must satisfy several selection rules based on conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the total to remain zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n    **`J_f = l_X`**\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    *   For `P_f` to be `+1`, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even.

Initial State and Governing Principles\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can deduce its quantum numbers:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0` (since `2S+1 = 1`).\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S').\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0').\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Governing Principles for the Decay:** The decay `1S0 -> NN(final) + X` must satisfy the following conditions:\n    1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`(-1)^L_f`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`-1`), and the orbital parity of X (`(-1)^l_X`).\n        *   `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n        *   For `P_f` to equal `+1`, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even. This means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics:** The problem provides the rule for the final NN state with isospin `T_f = 0`: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n    4.  **Physicality of the State:** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be 0 or 1. A state with any other spin value is unphysical.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe will now test each option against these four conditions.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`) | Particle X (`l_X`) | 1. Physical State? (`S_f`=0 or 1) | 2. `S_f + L_f` odd? (Pauli) | 3. `L_f + l_X` odd? (Parity) | 4. `J_f = l_X`? (Ang.

Conclusion\n\nOur analysis reveals that two of the proposed transitions are not permitted:\n\n*   **A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p:** This transition is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires a total spin of `S=3`, which is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons.\n*   **C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s:** This transition is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided for a final state with `T=0`. The sum `S_f + L_f` is 2 (even), but the rule requires it to be odd.\n\nThe question asks for a single answer and explicitly directs to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the given Pauli statistics rule. Option C is forbidden precisely because it violates this Pauli rule, while satisfying the conservation laws. Option A is forbidden for a more fundamental reason (the state is non-existent) that is not one of the transition rules explicitly listed. Therefore, the question is most directly answered by identifying the violation of the provided rules.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must analyze each proposed transition against the laws of conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle as specified for the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### **1. Initial State and Selection Rules**\n\nFirst, we establish the properties of the initial state and the rules governing the transition.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`)**:\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0` (since `2S+1 = 1`).\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S').\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0').\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Selection Rules for the Transition**:\n    The decay `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X` must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n    1.  **Pauli Statistics (as given)**: The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)` must hold. Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that the sum **`S(NN) + L(NN)` must be an odd number**.\n\n    2.  **Parity Conservation**: The total parity must be conserved (`P_initial = P_final`).\n        *   `P_initial = +1`.\n        *   The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`(-1)^L(NN)`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`-1`), and the parity of the relative orbital motion (`(-1)^l`, where `l` is the angular momentum of X).\n        *   `P_final = (-1)^L(NN) * (-1) * (-1)^l = (-1)^(L(NN) + l + 1)`.\n        *   For `P_final` to equal `+1`, the exponent `L(NN) + l + 1` must be even. This means **`L(NN) + l` must be an odd number**.\n\n    3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum must be conserved (`J_initial = J_final`).\n        *   `J_initial = 0`.\n        *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum `J(NN)` and the particle X's angular momentum `l` (assuming X is spinless).\n        *   For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: **`J(NN) = l`**.\n\n    4.  **Physicality of the NN State**: A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S(NN)` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any other value is unphysical.\n\n### **2. Evaluating the Options**\n\nWe now test each option against these four rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S(NN)=1`, `L(NN)=0`, `J(NN)=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l=1`. `J=l`. **OK.**\n4.  **Physicality:** `S=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S(NN)=1`, `L(NN)=1`, `J(NN)=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATION.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=0`, `l=0`. `J=l`. **OK.**\n4.  **Physicality:** `S=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics rule for the final state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S(NN)=3`. `L(NN)=2`, `J(NN)=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 3+2 = 5` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l = 2+1 = 3` (odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l=1`. `J=l`. OK.\n4.  **Physicality:** `S=3`. **VIOLATION.** A spin of S=3 is impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S(NN)=1`, `L(NN)=2`, `J(NN)=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=3`, `l=3`. `J=l`. **OK.**\n4.  **Physicality:** `S=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth options (B) and (C) describe forbidden transitions, but for different reasons:\n*   **(C) is forbidden** because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons.\n*   **(B) is forbidden** because the transition violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule given in the problem for a `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question asks to identify the non-permitted wave by making use of the specified conservation laws and the Pauli statistics rule. Option (B) is the one that is directly ruled out by an explicit application of the Pauli rule provided in the prompt. The issue with option (C) is more fundamental to the nature of the state itself, rather than the dynamics of the transition. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the specific test laid out in the question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine its quantum numbers:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0` (since `2S+1 = 1`).\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S').\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0').\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Decay Process:** The system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T_f = 0`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions derived from conservation laws and the Pauli principle.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n    **`J_f = l_X`**\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    Setting `P_i = P_f`: `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number. Therefore:\n    **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem explicitly states that for the final NN state with `T_f = 0`, the rule `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)` must hold.\n    Substituting `T_f = 0`: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. Therefore:\n    **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S_f` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a different total spin is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation (`J_f = l_X`):** `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` is odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` is odd):** `1 + 1 = 2`. This is even. **(VIOLATION)**\n4.  **Physicality (`S_f` is 0 or 1):** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics rule for a T=0 final state.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation (`J_f = l_X`):** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` is odd):** `2 + 1 = 3`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` is odd):** `3 + 2 = 5`. (OK)\n4.  **Physicality (`S_f` is 0 or 1):** `S_f=3`. **(VIOLATION)**\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation (`J_f = l_X`):** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` is odd):** `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` is odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n4.  **Physicality (`S_f` is 0 or 1):** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation (`J_f = l_X`):** `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` is odd):** `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` is odd):** `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n4.  **Physicality (`S_f` is 0 or 1):** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth options A and B describe forbidden transitions.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons.\n*   Option A is forbidden because the transition violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule provided in the problem for a `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave by making use of the provided conservation laws and the Pauli statistics rule. Option A is the one that is directly forbidden by the application of this specific Pauli rule, while satisfying the other conservation laws. The issue with option B is more fundamental (the state cannot exist), but the violation in A is a failure of the *process* selection rules that the question explicitly asks to be used. Therefore, A is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires us to identify a forbidden nuclear transition from a list of possibilities. To do this, we must establish a set of selection rules based on conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle, and then test each option against these rules.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the following quantum numbers:\n*   **Total Spin (S_i):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L_i):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J_i):** The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P_i):** The parity of the NN system is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Selection Rules for the Transition\nThe system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We are given that particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1, and the final NN state has an isospin of `T_f = 0`.\n\n1.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem provides a specific rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Given `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the sum of the final spin and orbital angular momentum, **`S_f + L_f`**, must be **odd**.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`j_X`). Assuming X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion, which also has intrinsic parity -1), its angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`.\n    *   `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   For the sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final total parity.\n    *   `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`\n    *   `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    *   For `P_f` to equal `+1`, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   Therefore, the sum **`L_f + l_X`** must be **odd**.\n\n4.  **Physicality of the NN State:** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. By the rules of angular momentum addition, their total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). Any other value is unphysical.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n3.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Physicality:** `S_f=3`. This **violates** the rule that the total spin of a two-nucleon system can only be 0 or 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). (OK)\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n3.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (OK)\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n3.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\nBoth options A and B describe transitions that are not permitted.\n*   Option A is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule provided in the problem for a final state with `T=0`.\n*   Option B is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the proposed final state `7D1` is unphysical and cannot be formed by two nucleons under any circumstances.\n\nSince the question asks to \"Make use of\" the given conservation laws and the specific Pauli statistics rule, the most likely intended answer is the one that fails this explicit test. The violation in option A is a direct failure to apply the rules governing the transition process itself, which is what the question is about.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. We use the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` to find its quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` -> Total Spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` -> Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` -> Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The system decays via `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions derived from conservation laws and the Pauli principle.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    The problem provides the rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`, we substitute this in:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number. This implies that the sum **`S_f + L_f` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be conserved, so `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   Equating the initial and final parities: `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number, which means **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`l_X`, assuming X is spinless).\n    *   For the vector sum `J_f + l_X` to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. By the rules of angular momentum addition, their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state requiring a different spin value is unphysical.\n\n### 3.

Conclusion\n\nOur analysis reveals that two of the options are not permitted:\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics rule given in the problem (`S_f + L_f` is even, but must be odd for a `T=0` final state).\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the proposed final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system (it requires a total spin `S=3`, which is impossible for two spin-1/2 particles).\n\nThe question asks for a single answer and explicitly instructs to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the provided Pauli statistics rule.\n*   The transition in option D satisfies all three of these explicit rules. It is forbidden for a more fundamental reason not listed in the instructions (the rules of spin addition).\n*   The transition in option A directly violates one of the explicitly provided rules (the Pauli statistics rule).\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is the one that fails the specific tests the question asks you to perform.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) bound system in a `1S0` state. We use the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` to find its quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter 'S' denotes the orbital angular momentum, so `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript '0' denotes the total angular momentum, so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Decay Process:** The initial state decays into a final NN state and a particle X: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T_f = 0`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`, relative to the final NN system.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor the decay to be permitted, it must satisfy several conservation laws and principles.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`j_X`). Assuming X is a spin-0 particle (standard for this notation), `j_X = l_X`. For the total final angular momentum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final total parity.\n    `P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`\n    `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    For `P_final` to equal `+1`, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even. This means:\n    `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    The problem provides the condition for the final `T_f = 0` state: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number, which means:\n    `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a spin multiplicity `2S+1` other than 1 or 3 is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Physicality:** `S_f=3`. This is **not possible** for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` state.\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle selection rule.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth options C and D describe forbidden transitions.\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is unphysical (a two-nucleon system cannot have S=3).\n*   **Option D** is forbidden because the transition violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule given in the problem for a `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question asks to identify the non-permitted wave by making use of the specified conservation laws and the Pauli statistics rule. Option D is the one that is directly forbidden by the application of these rules to the *process* itself. The issue with option C is more fundamental (the state cannot exist at all), but the transition *to* it hypothetically satisfies the selection rules. In the context of testing the application of selection rules, the violation in D is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires us to identify a forbidden nuclear transition by applying conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle. Let's break down the analysis into clear steps.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the following quantum numbers:\n*   **Total Spin (S_i):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L_i):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J_i):** The subscript '0' means `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P_i):** The parity of the NN system is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules for the Transition\nThe transition is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must check each potential final state against three selection rules derived from the problem statement.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the total to remain zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`(-1)^L_f`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`-1`), and the orbital parity of X (`(-1)^l_X`).\n    `P_i = P_f`\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This equation holds only if the exponent is even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem provides the condition for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. A state with S=3 is physically impossible.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` state.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n### Final Decision\nBoth options B and D describe forbidden transitions.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Option D is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule provided in the problem for a `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question asks us to use the provided conservation laws and Pauli statistics rule. The violation in option D is a direct failure to satisfy this specific rule. The violation in option B is due to a more fundamental principle (spin addition) not explicitly listed in the problem's instructions. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the test explicitly laid out in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine its quantum numbers:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0` (since `2S+1 = 1`)\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S')\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0')\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Decay Process:** The system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 2.

This means:\n    `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final State**\n    The problem provides the specific condition for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given that the final state has `T_f = 0`, this becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number, which means:\n    `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles.

Final Decision\nBoth options A and B describe forbidden transitions.\n*   **Option A** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is unphysical; two nucleons cannot form a total spin of S=3. This is a violation of the fundamental rules of spin addition.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the transition violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule provided in the problem for a final state with `T=0`.

Final Decision\n\nBoth options B and C describe forbidden transitions, but for different reasons:\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because the proposed final state, `7D1`, is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons (as their spins can only add up to S=0 or S=1, not S=3). This is a violation of the fundamental rules of spin addition.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the transition violates a specific selection rule for the process. The final state `3P0` can exist, but not with an isospin of T=0, as this violates the Pauli principle (`S_f + L_f` must be odd, but is even).\n\nThe question explicitly asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and provides the specific \"Pauli statistics\" rule. The violation in option B is a direct failure to satisfy this explicitly provided rule governing the transition dynamics. The violation in option C is due to the non-existence of the final state itself. In the context of applying the given rules to the process, option B is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine its quantum numbers:\n    *   **Total Spin `S_i`**: `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n    *   **Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i`**: The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   **Total Angular Momentum `J_i`**: The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Parity `P_i`**: The parity of the NN system is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\nFor the transition to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions based on conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final total parity.\n    `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    Setting `P_i = P_final`:\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\n    This requires `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    The problem provides the specific rule for the final state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Given that the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). A spin multiplicity `2S+1` other than 1 or 3 is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1` is a valid spin for an NN system. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T=0` state. (FAIL)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1` is a valid spin. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1` is a valid spin. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n4.  **Physicality:** `S_f=3` is **not a valid spin** for a two-nucleon system. (FAIL)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nBoth options B and D describe forbidden transitions, but for different reasons:\n*   **Option D** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is fundamentally impossible to construct with two nucleons.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the process violates a specific selection rule (the Pauli statistics for a T=0 final state) that was explicitly provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe question asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and provides the Pauli statistics rule. The violation in option B is found precisely by applying this specific rule set. The violation in option D is based on a more basic principle of spin addition not explicitly listed in the problem's instructions. Therefore, the question is most directly testing the violation found in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. We can determine its quantum numbers from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the NN system is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules for the Decay\nThe decay `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X` must obey several conservation laws and principles.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's angular momentum (`j_X`). Assuming particle X is spinless (as is standard for this notation), its angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`. For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). The final parity is the product of the parities of all components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X)_intrinsic = -1` (given)\n    *   `P(X)_orbital = (-1)^l_X`\n    Setting `P_i = P_f`:\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This equation holds only if the exponent is even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem provides the condition for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the NN State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a different total spin is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules. A transition is forbidden if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1` is valid. (OK)\n2.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = l_X`):** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` odd):** `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n4.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Physicality:** `S_f=3` is **not valid** for a two-nucleon system. (FAIL)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1` is valid. (OK)\n2.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = l_X`):** `0 = 0`. (OK)\n3.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n4.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd):** `1 + 1 = 2` (even). (FAIL)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Physicality:** `S_f=1` is valid. (OK)\n2.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = l_X`):** `3 = 3`. (OK)\n3.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` odd):** `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n4.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd):** `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Final Decision\nBoth options B and C describe forbidden transitions.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Option C is forbidden because the process violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem for a `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the given \"Pauli statistics\" rule. Option C is the one that is forbidden by a direct application of these rules governing the *process*. The issue with option B is the non-existence of the final *state* itself, which is a more fundamental but separate piece of knowledge. In the context of applying the given rules to the proposed transitions, the violation in C is the most direct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. We use the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)` to extract its quantum numbers:\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the NN system is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Establish the Selection Rules for the Decay**\nThe decay process is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must apply conservation laws and the given Pauli principle constraint. Let the final NN state have quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and the emitted particle X have orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem provides the rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Given that the final state has isospin `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   Equating the parities: `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n    The total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`l_X`, assuming X is spinless).\n    *   For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the Two-Nucleon State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles.

The violation in option A is a direct failure of the explicitly provided Pauli rule. The violation in option D is due to a more fundamental principle of spin addition, which is prerequisite knowledge. In the context of such problems, the intended answer is typically the one that fails the specific, complex rule provided in the question. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must analyze each proposed transition against the laws of conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle as it applies to the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Conservation Rules\n\nFirst, we establish the properties of the initial state and the rules governing the transition.\n\n*   **Initial State (`1S0`)**: The system starts as two nucleons in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we deduce:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the 'S')\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`\n    *   Parity `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1` (even)\n\n*   **Conservation Laws and Principles**: The transition `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X` must obey the following rules:\n    1.  **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`). For the sum to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n    2.  **Parity Conservation**: The initial parity (`+1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`. For `P_f` to be `+1`, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even. This means **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics (as given)**: For the final NN state with isospin `T_f = 0`, the rule `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)` must hold. Substituting `T_f = 0` gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n    4.  **Physicality of NN States**: A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). Any state with a spin multiplicity `2S_f+1` other than 1 or 3 is unphysical.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe will now test each option against these four conditions. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`) | Particle X (`l_X`) | 1. `J_f = l_X`? | 2. `L_f + l_X` odd? | 3. `S_f + L_f` odd? | 4. `S_f` valid? | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A) `-> 3D3 + f` | `S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3` | `l_X=3` | `3 = 3` (Yes) | `2 + 3 = 5` (Yes) | `1 + 2 = 3` (Yes) | `S_f=1` (Yes) | **Yes** |\n| B) `-> 3S1 + p` | `S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1` | `l_X=1` | `1 = 1` (Yes) | `0 + 1 = 1` (Yes) | `1 + 0 = 1` (Yes) | `S_f=1` (Yes) | **Yes** |\n| C) `-> 3P0 + s` | `S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0` | `l_X=0` | `0 = 0` (Yes) | `1 + 0 = 1` (Yes) | `1 + 1 = 2` (**No**) | `S_f=1` (Yes) | **No** |\n| D) `-> 7D1 + p` | `S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1` | `l_X=1` | `1 = 1` (Yes) | `2 + 1 = 3` (Yes) | `3 + 2 = 5` (Yes) | `S_f=3` (**No**) | **No** |\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals that two of the options are not permitted:\n\n*   **Option C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem. For the final `3P0` state, `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is an even number. The rule for a `T_f=0` final state requires this sum to be odd.\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is not permitted because the proposed final state `7D1` is unphysical. It requires a total spin `S_f=3`, which is impossible to form from two spin-1/2 nucleons.\n\nWhile both transitions are forbidden, they fail for different reasons. The failure in option D is due to the fundamental impossibility of the state itself. The failure in option C is a violation of the specific selection rule governing the dynamics of this particular transition, a rule that was explicitly provided in the problem statement. In physics problems of this nature, one is typically expected to apply the given rules to find the forbidden process. The violation in option C is a direct failure of the Pauli statistics rule that the question instructs the user to apply.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script successfully analyzed the four possible transitions based on the principles of nuclear physics. The code checked each transition against four rules: the physical possibility of the final state, the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state, parity conservation, and angular momentum conservation.\n\nThe output shows that two of the transitions are not permitted:\n\n1.  **Option C: `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**: This transition is forbidden because the final two-nucleon state `7D1` implies a total spin of S=3. A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, the state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n2.  **Option D: `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**: This transition is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided for a final state with isospin T=0. For the final state `3P0`, the spin is S=1 and the orbital angular momentum is L=1. The sum `S+L = 1+1 = 2`, which is an even number. The rule requires `S+L` to be odd for a T=0 final state.\n\nBoth C and D are forbidden transitions. However, the question asks for a single answer and explicitly instructs to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and the given Pauli statistics rule. The violation in option D is a direct failure to apply this specific Pauli rule. The violation in option C is more fundamental, as the state itself is impossible, a fact derived from basic spin addition rather than the specific transition rules mentioned. In the context of such problems, the intended answer is typically the one that violates the specific, non-trivial rules provided for the process.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. We use the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)` to extract its quantum numbers:\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The subscript '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules for the Transition\nThe system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must apply the conservation laws and the given Pauli statistics rule to find the conditions for a permitted transition.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`). Assuming particle X is spinless (standard for this type of problem), its angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`. For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`). The final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X)_intrinsic = -1` (given)\n    *   `P(X)_orbital = (-1)^l_X`\n    The conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`, which simplifies to `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`. This requires `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which is only true if the exponent is odd.\n    Therefore, `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem explicitly states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)` must hold.\n    Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the Final State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). A state with any other spin value is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any rule.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Rule 4 (Physicality):** `S_f=3` is not possible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-Cons):** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. (OK)\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Rule 4 (Physicality):** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-Cons):** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. (OK)\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   **Rule 4 (Physicality):** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-Cons):** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. (OK)\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n*   **Rule 4 (Physicality):** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n### Final Decision\nBoth options A and C describe forbidden transitions.\n*   Option A is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons.\n*   Option C is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics selection rule given in the problem for a final state with `T=0`.\n\nThe question asks to identify the non-permitted wave by making use of the specified conservation laws and the Pauli statistics rule. Option C is the one that is forbidden precisely by the application of these explicit rules governing the transition process. The issue with option A is more fundamental to the existence of the state itself, rather than the dynamics of the transition. Therefore, the violation in option C is the most direct answer to the question as posed.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Initial State and the Process\n\nFirst, we must understand the quantum numbers of the initial state and the rules governing the decay.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is a two-nucleon (NN) pair in a `1S0` state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` tells us:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` → Total Spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` → Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` → Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Decay:** The system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 2. Deriving the Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions derived from conservation laws and the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's angular momentum (`j_X`). Assuming particle X is spinless (standard for this notation), `j_X` is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`. For the final total angular momentum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`(-1)^L_f`), the intrinsic parity of X (`-1`), and the parity of the relative orbital motion (`(-1)^l_X`).\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This equation holds only if the exponent is even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics (as given)**\n    The problem provides a specific rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T_f = 0`, this becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of the State**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state requiring a different total spin is unphysical.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe will now test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any rule.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`) | Particle X (`l_X`) | Rule 4 (S valid?) | Rule 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd?) | Rule 2 (`L_f+l_X` odd?) | Rule 1 (`J_f=l_X`?) | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A) `7D1` | `S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1` | `p` (`l_X=1`) | **FAIL** | `3+2=5` (OK) | `2+1=3` (OK) | `1=1` (OK) | **No** |\n| B) `3S1` | `S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1` | `p` (`l_X=1`) | OK | `1+0=1` (OK) | `0+1=1` (OK) | `1=1` (OK) | **Yes** |\n| C) `3P0` | `S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0` | `s` (`l_X=0`) | OK | `1+1=2` (**FAIL**) | `1+0=1` (OK) | `0=0` (OK) | **No** |\n| D) `3D3` | `S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3` | `f` (`l_X=3`) | OK | `1+2=3` (OK) | `2+3=5` (OK) | `3=3` (OK) | **Yes** |\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals that two of the proposed transitions are not permitted:\n\n1.  **Option A (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires a total spin of `S=3`. It is physically impossible to form a spin-3 state from two spin-1/2 nucleons.\n2.  **Option C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem. For the final state `3P0`, `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f + L_f = 2` (even). The rule for a `T=0` final state requires this sum to be odd.\n\nSince the question asks for a single answer, we must determine which violation is the intended focus. The question explicitly instructs the solver to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and provides the specific Pauli statistics formula. Option C is forbidden precisely because it fails to satisfy this explicit formula. The issue with Option A is more fundamental (the state is non-existent) but relies on knowledge not directly enumerated in the problem's instructions. In the context of a physics problem, the intended answer is typically the one that tests the specific, and often more complex, rules provided.\n\nTherefore, the transition that is not permitted based on the rules given is `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
