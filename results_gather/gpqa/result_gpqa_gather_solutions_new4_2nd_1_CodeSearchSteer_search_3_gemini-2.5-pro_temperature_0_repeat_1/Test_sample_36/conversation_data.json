Elucidation of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   This reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT).\n    *   Product **A** is the cyclic thioacetal, 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2).\n    *   Product **B** is the resulting nucleophilic carbanion, 2-lithio-2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane. This is an example of umpolung (polarity inversion).\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position.\n    *   Product **C** is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   The dithiane protecting group is removed via hydrolysis, regenerating the carbonyl group.\n    *   Product **D** is the ketone, 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   This ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (D). The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide.\n    *   The final product **E** is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Final Product's ¹³C-NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to determining the number of ¹³C-NMR signals is to analyze the symmetry of the final product, E.\n\n*   **Structure of E:**\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃\n          |\n    CH₃CH₂-C=C-CH₂CH₃\n          |\n          CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a C₂ axis of rotation perpendicular to the C=C bond and a plane of symmetry that bisects it.\n    *   A critical point is that each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical groups (two ethyl groups). Therefore, no E/Z (geometric) isomers are possible for this molecule.\n    *   Because of the high symmetry, several groups of carbons are chemically equivalent:\n        1.  The two carbons of the central double bond (C=C) are equivalent to each other. This will produce **one signal**.\n        2.  All four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons of the ethyl groups are in identical chemical environments. This will produce **one signal**.\n        3.  All four methyl (-CH₃-) carbons at the ends of the ethyl groups are also in identical chemical environments. This will produce **one signal**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    By adding the signals from the unique carbon environments (1 + 1 + 1), we find that the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, will show a total of **3** signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**3. Matching with Options**\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 3. This corresponds to option C.\n\nA) 6\nB) 11\nC) 3\nD) 8\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Elucidation of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    This reaction protects the carbonyl group of propionaldehyde (an aldehyde) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The product, A, is a cyclic thioacetal called 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2). This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, B, in a process known as umpolung (polarity inversion).\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic bromoethane, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position. The product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    This step removes the dithiane protecting group, hydrolyzing it back to a carbonyl group. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the product, D, is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. This ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃. The ylide then reacts with the ketone, D (3-pentanone), replacing the C=O double bond with a C=C double bond.\n    *   Ketone: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O\n    *   Ylide: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃\n    *   Final Product (E): (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂\n\nThe final product, E, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹³C-NMR Signals for Product E**\n\nTo determine the number of signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum, we must identify the number of chemically unique carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is:\n```\n      CH₂CH₃\n      |\nCH₃CH₂-C=C-CH₂CH₃\n      |\n      CH₂CH₃\n```\nThis molecule is highly symmetrical. A C₂ axis of rotation passes through the center of the C=C double bond, making the left and right halves of the molecule identical.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Isomerism.** The product E, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂, cannot have E/Z (geometric) isomers because each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical groups (two ethyl groups). Therefore, only one structure is possible.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Symmetry and Equivalence.**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl Group Carbons:** The four ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the methylene (-CH₂-) and methyl (-CH₃) carbons are distinct.\n    3.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Because all four ethyl groups are equivalent, all four methylene carbons are also equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n    4.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, all four terminal methyl carbons are equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy summing the unique carbon environments, we find:\n1 (for C=C) + 1 (for -CH₂-) + 1 (for -CH₃) = 3 signals.\n\nThe final product, E, will produce 3 signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Elucidate the Reaction Sequence and Final Product (E)**\n\nThe majority of the provided answers correctly trace the five-step synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    This is a standard protection of an aldehyde using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    Product A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    BuLi, a strong base, deprotonates the acidic proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2), creating a nucleophilic carbanion. This is a classic \"umpolung\" or polarity inversion reaction.\n    Product B is the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane carbanion.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position.\n    Product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    The thioacetal protecting group is removed (hydrolyzed) to regenerate a carbonyl group.\n    Product D is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction. The ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, which is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃. This ylide reacts with the ketone (D, 3-pentanone).\n    The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O.\n    The final product, E, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Structure of E for ¹³C-NMR Signals**\n\nThe structure of the final product, E, is:\n```\n      CH₂CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n           \\ /\n            C=C\n           / \\\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n```\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically unique carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Stereoisomerism.** One agent suggested the possibility of E/Z isomers, leading to 8 signals. This is incorrect. For E/Z isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. In 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical ethyl groups. Therefore, no E/Z isomers are possible for this molecule.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Molecular Symmetry.** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the center of the C=C bond, perpendicular to the bond axis. This symmetry makes the four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the central double bond are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, all four methylene carbons are also equivalent. This will produce a **second signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, all four terminal methyl carbons are equivalent. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, has three distinct types of carbon atoms due to its high degree of symmetry. Therefore, it will produce **3** signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 11\nB) 8\nC) 6\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of product A**\n*   **Reaction:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) + EDT (1,2-ethanedithiol, HSCH₂CH₂SH) / BF₃\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard reaction for the protection of a carbonyl group.

Plan**\n*   First, I will trace the multi-step reaction sequence to determine the chemical structure of the final product, E.\n*   Next, I will analyze the symmetry of the final product E.\n*   Finally, based on the molecule's symmetry, I will count the number of unique carbon environments to determine the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Execution of the Plan**\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    This is a standard protection reaction. The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) to form a cyclic thioacetal. The product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    BuLi is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton on A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic (pKa ≈ 31) due to the stabilizing effect of the sulfur atoms on the resulting carbanion. This reaction, an example of umpolung, creates a nucleophilic carbanion, B.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion B attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction. This adds a second ethyl group to the carbon between the sulfur atoms. The product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    This step removes the dithiane protecting group, hydrolyzing the thioacetal back to a carbonyl group. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the product, D, is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone).\n    Structure of D: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction.\n    1.  First, the Wittig ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The resulting ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    2.  This ylide then reacts with the ketone, D (3-pentanone). The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide.\n    3.  Reaction: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n    4.  The final product, E, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**3. 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe structure of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is:\n```\n      CH₂CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n```\nTo find the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically unique carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Stereoisomerism.** One must consider if E/Z isomers are possible. For E/Z isomerism to occur, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. In this molecule, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two *identical* ethyl groups. Therefore, **no E/Z isomers exist for 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.** The analysis in candidate answer 6, which assumes E/Z isomers, is incorrect.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Symmetry.** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the center of the C=C bond and perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. This symmetry makes the four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the central double bond are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, all four methylene carbons are also equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, all four terminal methyl carbons are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\nTotal signals = 1 (alkene) + 1 (methylene) + 1 (methyl) = **3 signals**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, which is a highly symmetrical molecule. This symmetry results in only three unique carbon environments. Therefore, its 13C-NMR spectrum will show 3 signals. This corresponds to option D in the original question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

This is an example of umpolung (polarity inversion).\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophile bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   Product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This step is the deprotection of the thioacetal group using mercuric chloride in aqueous acid.\n    *   The carbonyl group is regenerated. Since the original carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the product D is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   This ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n    *   The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon double bond by replacing the C=O and C=P bonds.\n    *   The final product E is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂, which is named **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2.

Due to this symmetry:\n    *   The two carbons of the central double bond (C=C) are chemically equivalent.\n    *   All four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the double bond are equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The four methylene carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all in an identical chemical environment. This gives a **second signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** The four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are also all in an identical chemical environment. This gives a **third signal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, has three distinct types of carbon atoms due to its high degree of symmetry. Therefore, it will produce 3 signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum. This corresponds to option C.\n\nA careful point to note is that E/Z isomerism is not possible for this molecule because each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical groups (two ethyl groups), invalidating the reasoning presented in candidate answer 6.

    "Based on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step resolution to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a protection reaction. The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal. The product, **A**, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: This is an acid-base reaction. Butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon located between the two sulfur atoms (C2). This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, a process known as \"umpolung\" or polarity inversion. The product, **B**, is the lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane, displacing the bromide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The product, **C**, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: This is a deprotection reaction. The thioacetal group is hydrolyzed, typically using a mercury(II) salt in aqueous acid, to regenerate the carbonyl group. Since the protected carbon was bonded to two ethyl groups, the product, **D**, is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone), with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, the Wittig ylide is prepared. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane, and the resulting phosphonium salt is deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   The ylide then reacts with the ketone, D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone and the PPh₃ group of the ylide are eliminated, forming a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The final product, **E**, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n### Analysis of the Final Product's ¹³C-NMR Spectrum\n\nThe final step is to determine the number of signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of the final product, E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene). This is done by identifying the number of chemically unique carbon atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure of E**:\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃\n          |\n    CH₃CH₂-C=C-CH₂CH₃\n          |\n          CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the center of the C=C double bond, making the four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments**:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C)**: The two carbons of the central double bond are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. This results in a **second signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This results in a **third signal**.\n\nIn total, there are three distinct types of carbon atoms in the molecule. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene will show **3 signals**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Identification of Reactions**: Each step involves a common but distinct organic reaction (protection, umpolung, alkylation, deprotection, Wittig). A mistake in any step would lead to an incorrect final product.\n*   **Structure of the Wittig Reagent**: The Wittig ylide is derived from 3-bromopentane, not a simpler halide, which is crucial for forming the final symmetrical alkene.\n*   **Molecular Symmetry**: Recognizing the high degree of symmetry in the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is the most critical step for solving the NMR problem.\n*   **Absence of E/Z Isomerism**: A potential pitfall is to consider E/Z isomers. However, for geometric isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. In this case, each carbon is attached to two identical ethyl groups, so no E/Z isomers are possible.\n*   **Mapping to Options**: After determining the answer is 3, it must be correctly matched to the given options: A) 6, B) 8, C) 3, D) 11. The number 3 corresponds to option C.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe reaction sequence produces 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. Due to its high symmetry, this molecule has only three unique carbon environments. Therefore, it will produce 3 signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Execution of the Plan**\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    This is a standard protection reaction. The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) to form a cyclic thioacetal. The product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    BuLi is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton on A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic (pKa ≈ 31) due to the stabilizing effect of the sulfur atoms on the resulting carbanion. This reaction, an example of umpolung, creates a nucleophilic carbanion, B.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion B attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction. This adds a second ethyl group to the carbon between the sulfur atoms. The product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    This step removes the dithiane protecting group, hydrolyzing the thioacetal back to a carbonyl group. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the product, D, is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone).\n    Structure of D: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction.\n    1.  First, the Wittig ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The resulting ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    2.  This ylide then reacts with the ketone, D (3-pentanone). The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide.\n    3.  Reaction: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n    4.

For E/Z isomerism to occur, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. In this molecule, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two *identical* ethyl groups. Therefore, **no E/Z isomers exist for 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.** The analysis in candidate answer 6, which assumes E/Z isomers, is incorrect.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Symmetry.** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the center of the C=C bond and perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. This symmetry makes the four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the central double bond are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, all four methylene carbons are also equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, all four terminal methyl carbons are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\nTotal signals = 1 (alkene) + 1 (methylene) + 1 (methyl) = **3 signals**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, which is a highly symmetrical molecule. This symmetry results in only three unique carbon environments.

The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   Product A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   n-Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from A, which is the proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms. This creates a nucleophilic carbanion. This is an example of \"umpolung\" or polarity inversion.\n    *   Product B is the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   An ethyl group is added to the carbanion carbon.\n    *   Product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This step removes the thioacetal protecting group, regenerating the carbonyl group.\n    *   Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone).\n    *   Product D is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. First, the Wittig ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The ylide's structure is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   This ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (D). The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O.\n    *   The final product, E, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Final Product's ¹³C-NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe next step is to determine the number of signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. This depends on the number of chemically unique carbon atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure of E:**\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n          CH₂CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the center of the C=C double bond, and a plane of symmetry bisecting it.\n    *   A crucial point is that this molecule cannot have E/Z isomers, because each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical groups (two ethyl groups).\n    *   Due to this high symmetry:\n        1.  The two carbons of the central double bond (C=C) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n        2.  All four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n        3.  Within the ethyl groups, the four methylene carbons (-CH₂-) are all equivalent. They will produce a **second signal**.\n        4.  Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons (-CH₃) are all equivalent. They will produce a **third signal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, has three distinct types of carbon atoms. Therefore, it will produce **3** signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 8\nB) 3\nC) 11\nD) 6\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, E.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   **Reactants**: Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH).
