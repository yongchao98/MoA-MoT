This means its lifetime as measured in the laboratory (the bubble chamber) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation.\n*   **Particle Decay:** The decay of individual particles is a random process governed by an exponential probability law.\n*   **Observation Condition:** In a tracking detector, \"observing\" a decay means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($R_{res}$) before it decays. If it travels a shorter distance, its track is not resolved from its creation point.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the resolution $R_{res}$ such that the probability of the particle's travel distance ($d$) being greater than $R_{res}$ is at least 30%. The condition is: $P(d > R_{res}) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor quantifies the time dilation.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{\\text{Total Energy (E)}}{\\text{Rest Energy} (m_0c^2)} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($p$):** This is needed for a precise calculation of the decay length. We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$):** A direct formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$.\n    *   $c\\tau_0 = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) = 2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}$\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution ($R_{res}$)\nThe probability of a particle traveling a distance $d$ or more is $P(d > R_{res}) = e^{-R_{res}/\\lambda}$. We need this probability to be at least 0.30. To find the boundary condition (the largest permissible resolution), we solve the equality:\n$e^{-R_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{R_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$R_{res} = \\lambda \\times 1.204 \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThe resolution must be less than or equal to this value: $R_{res} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Final Analysis\n\nThe given options are:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nOur calculated maximum allowed resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   Options A and D are too large (poorer resolution) and would not observe 30% of the decays.\n*   Option B is a valid resolution, but it is much finer than necessary.\n*   Option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the only value that is both of the correct order of magnitude and satisfies the condition ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$).\n\n**A careful point on problem design:** It is common in physics problems for percentages like \"30%\" to be approximations of simple fractions. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended value was 1/3 (~33.3%).\n*   $e^{-R_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n*   $R_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This strongly suggests that the problem was designed with the 1/3 fraction in mind, making C the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Scenario:** The problem involves a high-energy particle ($X^0$) that decays. Because its energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), it is moving at a speed very close to the speed of light. This requires the use of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Question:** The goal is to find the \"minimum resolution\" needed to \"observe at least 30% of the decays.\"\n    *   **Observing a decay:** In a tracking detector like a bubble chamber, \"observing\" a decay means being able to distinguish the particle's track from its creation point to its decay point. This is only possible if the particle travels a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution, `R`.\n    *   **At least 30%:** Particle decay is a random, exponential process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `d` or more before decaying is given by the survival probability $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame. The condition is to find the resolution `R` such that $e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n    *   **Minimum Resolution:** This refers to the least stringent requirement, meaning the largest possible value for the resolution `R` that still satisfies the condition. We therefore solve for the boundary case: $R = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying.\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which quantifies the relativistic effects.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{\\text{Total Energy}}{\\text{Rest Mass Energy}} = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n    *   Next, calculate the particle's momentum, `p`. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   The mean decay length $\\lambda$ can be calculated precisely using the formula:\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$\n        Given the proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and the speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution (R):**\n    *   Using the condition from Step 2: $R = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n    *   $R \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    *   $R \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Refine Interpretation:**\n    *   The calculated value is $R \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The resolution must be less than or equal to this value.\n    *   The provided options are A) 2.08\\*1e-9 m, B) 2.08\\*1e-6 m, C) 2.08\\*1e-3 m, D) 2.08\\*1e-1 m.\n    *   Option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the closest value that satisfies the condition $R \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    *   As noted in several candidate answers, it is common in physics problems for \"30%\" to be an approximation for \"1/3\". If we recalculate with the condition $e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 1/3$:\n        $R = -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n        $R \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n    *   This refined calculation gives a result of $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is extremely close to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). This strongly suggests that this was the intended calculation.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical:** The particle is highly relativistic ($\\gamma \\approx 7.9$), so using classical formulas for kinetic energy or momentum would lead to incorrect results.\n*   **Proper vs. Lab Frame:** The given lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is in the particle's rest frame. The distance traveled is in the lab frame, so the time-dilated lifetime ($\\tau = \\gamma\\tau_0$) or an equivalent relativistic formula for decay length must be used.\n*   **Decay Probability:** The core of the problem relies on the exponential decay law, $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, which gives the probability of a particle surviving for a distance `d` or more.\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Minimum Resolution\":** This term refers to the coarsest (largest) resolution that can still achieve the goal, not the smallest possible number.\n*   **Approximations in Problem Statements:** The discrepancy between the calculation with 30% and the provided options highlights that values in physics problems can sometimes be rounded or be approximations (like 30% for 1/3), and checking for such possibilities can lead to a more precise match.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, the calculation assuming the condition is to observe at least 1/3 of the decays provides the best fit to the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the minimum resolution of a detector required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Physics:**\n    *   **Observing a Decay:** In a tracking detector like a bubble chamber, \"observing\" a decay means being able to distinguish the track of the parent particle ($X^0$) from its creation point before it decays into its daughter particles ($Y^+Z^-$). This requires the parent particle to travel a distance ($d$) that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($R$).\n    *   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle has a total energy (27 GeV) much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. Its lifetime in the lab frame will be significantly longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation.\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of individual particles is a random process. The probability that a particle travels a distance greater than $R$ before decaying follows an exponential law: $P(d > R) = e^{-R/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition:**\n    We need the probability of observing the decay to be at least 30% (0.30).\n    $P(d > R) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n    To find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $R = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab. It can be calculated using the particle's momentum ($p$) and proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n    *   **First, find the momentum ($p$):** Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        *   $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n    *   **Next, calculate $\\lambda$:** The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$.\n        *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n        *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        *   $\\lambda \\approx 7.853 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Resolution (R):**\n    Now, substitute the value of $\\lambda$ into the equation from Step 3.\n    $R = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n    $R \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    $R \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Analyze Discrepancy:**\n    The calculated value is $R \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The provided options are:\n    A) 2.08*1e-9 m\n    B) 2.08*1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08*1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08*1e-1 m\n\n    The calculated value is numerically closest to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), and they share the same order of magnitude. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. The ~9% difference between the calculated value and the option is a common occurrence in physics problems and can be explained.\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"at least 30%\":** As shown by several candidate answers (e.g., Answer 2, Answer 14), it is highly probable that \"at least 30%\" is a rounded statement for observing the fraction of decays corresponding to $1/e$ or $1/3$. Let's test the $1/3$ hypothesis, as it's a common value in decay problems.\n    *   Condition: $e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 1/3$\n    *   $R \\le -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n    *   $R \\le (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (1.0986)$\n    *   $R \\le 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   **Conclusion:** This revised calculation gives a result of $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is an excellent match for option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This confirms that the intended question was likely based on observing at least 1/3 of the decays.\n*   **Final Check:** A resolution of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is less than the maximum allowable resolution calculated using the strict 30% value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), so it satisfies the condition of observing *at least* 30% of the decays. The calculation based on 1/3 provides strong evidence that C is the intended answer.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among the provided answers, supported by a careful step-by-step analysis, points to the value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. According to the original question's formatting, this corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum spatial resolution required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a particle, $X^0$. In a detector like a bubble chamber, observing a decay means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays. If the track is shorter than the resolution, it cannot be distinguished from the creation point.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physical Condition:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(x \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame and $d_{res}$ is the detector resolution.\n    We need to find the resolution $d_{res}$ such that this probability is at least 30% (0.3).\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.3$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length depends on the particle's properties in the lab frame, which are affected by special relativity.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy ($m_0c^2$).\n        *   Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. A direct and accurate way to calculate it is using the particle's momentum ($p$).\n        *   First, find the momentum from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} \\approx 26.78$ GeV.\n        *   The formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\tau_0$.\n        *   Given: Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n        *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$):** Now we solve the probability equation from Step 2. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution,\" which in this context means the least stringent (i.e., largest) resolution that still meets the condition. We solve for the boundary case:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.3$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.3) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Finalize:**\n    *   The calculated required resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    *   The given options are:\n        A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n        B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n        C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n        D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    *   The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close in magnitude to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The other options are off by several orders of magnitude.\n    *   The small discrepancy (~9%) is very common in such problems and is likely due to the given values being slightly rounded.\n    *   As noted by some agents, if we assume \"30%\" is an approximation for \"1/3\" (~33.3%), the calculation yields $d_{res} = \\lambda \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is almost identical to option C. This provides strong evidence that C is the intended answer.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativity is Key:** Non-relativistic formulas would give a completely wrong answer. Time dilation and the relativistic energy-momentum relation are essential.\n*   **Mean Decay Length:** The calculation must be done in the lab frame, using the time-dilated lifetime or the relativistic momentum.\n*   **Probability Interpretation:** \"Observe at least 30% of decays\" means the probability of the decay length being *greater than* the resolution is at least 0.3.\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculated value may not perfectly match an option due to rounding in the problem statement. The closest option with the correct order of magnitude is the correct choice. Many of the provided candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but misidentified the letter corresponding to the correct numerical answer.\n\nThe most thorough analyses correctly identify the calculation steps and conclude that the value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is the correct answer, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points and evaluating the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Interpret the Physics\nThe core task is to find the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" the decay of a particle.\n*   **Observing a decay:** In a tracking detector like a bubble chamber, this means the particle must travel a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's resolution `R` before it decays. If `d < R`, the creation and decay points are indistinguishable.\n*   **\"At least 30% of the decays\":** This sets a statistical condition. The probability that a particle's travel distance `d` is greater than the resolution `R` must be at least 0.30.\n    *   `P(d > R) ≥ 0.30`\n*   **\"Minimum resolution\":** This phrase can be ambiguous. In this context, it refers to the coarsest (i.e., largest numerical value) resolution `R` that still satisfies the condition. Any resolution finer (smaller) than this would also work, but the question asks for the boundary value. We therefore solve for the equality: `P(d > R) = 0.30`.\n\n### Step 2: Relativistic Calculations\nThe particle is highly relativistic, so we must use formulas from special relativity.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Total Energy, `E = 27 GeV`\n*   Rest Mass Energy, `m₀c² = 3.41 GeV`\n*   Proper Lifetime, `τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s`\n\n**Calculation of Mean Decay Length (λ):**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. The most direct way to calculate this is using the particle's momentum.\n\n1.  **Find the momentum (`p`):** Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`.\n    *   `(pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²`\n    *   `pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV`\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length (`λ`):** The formula is `λ = (pc / m₀c²) * cτ₀`.\n    *   `cτ₀` is the distance light travels in one proper lifetime: `(2.998 × 10⁸ m/s) × (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m`.\n    *   `λ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\n\nThis value `λ ≈ 1.885 µm` is the average distance the particle travels.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Decay Probability Law\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance `d` or more is given by the exponential decay law: `P(d) = e^(-d/λ)`. We need to find the resolution `R` such that `P(R) = 0.30`.\n\n*   `e^(-R/λ) = 0.30`\n*   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `-R/λ = ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204`\n*   Solving for `R`: `R = λ * 1.204 ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.204 ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Final Analysis\n\nOur calculated required resolution is `R ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`.

The other options are off by several orders of magnitude.\n\n**Careful Points & Refinement:**\n1.  **Discrepancy:** There is a ~9% difference between our calculated value (`2.27 µm`) and the closest option (`2.08 µm`). This is a common occurrence in physics problems where the given numbers might be slightly rounded or inconsistent with the options.\n2.  **The \"1/3\" Hypothesis:** As noted by several candidate answers, if we assume \"30%\" is an approximation for 1/3 (≈33.3%), the calculation becomes:\n    *   `e^(-R/λ) = 1/3`\n    *   `-R/λ = ln(1/3) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986`\n    *   `R = λ * 1.0986 ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.0986 ≈ 2.07 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\n3.  **Conclusion:** This result, `2.07 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is an excellent match for option B, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`. This strongly suggests that the problem intended for the fraction to be 1/3.\n\nBoth interpretations point to option B as the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution a detector (the Bubble Chamber) needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the X⁰ particle.\n*   **Observing a decay:** This means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays. If the decay happens at a distance smaller than the resolution, the decay point is indistinguishable from the creation point.\n*   **Condition:** The probability that the particle's travel distance (`d`) is greater than the resolution (`R`) must be at least 30% (0.30).\n    *   `P(d > R) ≥ 0.30`\n\n### **2. Key Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** The particle is moving at a high speed, so its lifetime in the lab frame (`τ`) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ₀`) by a factor of `γ` (the Lorentz factor).\n*   **Mean Decay Length:** The average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is called the mean decay length (`λ`).\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by `P(d > x) = e^(-x/λ)`.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n*   Given: E = 27 GeV, m₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n*   γ = E / m₀c² = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe most direct way to calculate the mean decay length is using the particle's momentum.\n1.  Find the momentum (`p`) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    *   (pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²\n    *   pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV\n\n2.  Calculate the mean decay length (`λ`) using the formula: λ = (pc / m₀c²) * cτ₀\n    *   Given: τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s, c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   λ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n    *   λ ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m)\n    *   λ ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Required Resolution (R)**\n\nWe use the exponential decay law to find the resolution `R` that satisfies the condition. To find the minimum required resolution (which is the largest, or least stringent, value of R that works), we solve the boundary condition:\n*   `e^(-R/λ) = 0.30`\n*   Take the natural logarithm of both sides: `-R/λ = ln(0.30)`\n*   Solve for R: `R = -λ * ln(0.30)`\n*   Using ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204:\n*   R ≈ -(1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\n*   R ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### **4. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated required resolution is `R ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`. This means the resolution must be less than or equal to this value. Let's examine the options:\n*   A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n*   B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n*   C) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n*   D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nThe calculated value `2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m` is very close in magnitude to option D, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`. The other options are off by several orders of magnitude.\n\n**Careful Point: Explaining the Discrepancy**\nThe small difference between the calculated value (2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m) and the option (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m) is very likely due to one of two reasons:\n1.  The initial values in the problem (mass, energy, lifetime) were slightly rounded when the problem was created.\n2.  The problem intended for \"30%\" to be an approximation of \"1/3\". If we recalculate with a probability of 1/3:\n    *   `R = -λ * ln(1/3) = λ * ln(3)`\n    *   `R ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.0986 ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n    This result (`2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`) is extremely close to option D (`2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`). This is a very common practice in physics problems.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning strongly indicate that `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m` is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Physics\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution of a detector needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$.\n*   **Observing a decay:** In a tracking detector like a bubble chamber, this means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) before it decays. If it decays before traveling this distance, its track is too short to be resolved from its creation point.\n*   **At least 30%:** This sets up a probability condition. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $d \\ge d_{res}$ must be at least 0.30.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must use formulas from special relativity, specifically for time dilation and momentum.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance $d$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Calculation\n1.  Calculate the particle's momentum ($p$) in the lab frame using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n2.  Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) in the lab frame. A direct and accurate formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$.\n3.  Set up the probability condition: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n4.  Solve for the resolution $d_{res}$. The term \"minimum resolution\" is interpreted as the least stringent requirement, which corresponds to the largest possible value of $d_{res}$ that satisfies the condition. We therefore solve the equality: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\n**Given values:**\n*   Total Energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   Proper Lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n1.  **Calculate momentum term `pc`:**\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate mean decay length `λ`:**\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0 = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the required resolution `d_res`:**\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe calculated required resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The detector resolution must be less than or equal to this value.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\nThe only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m) is A. The value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is numerically close to our calculated value of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n**Careful Point - Explaining the Discrepancy:**\nThe small difference between the calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the option ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very likely intentional. As noted in several of the candidate answers, if the requirement \"30%\" is treated as an approximation for \"1/3\" (~33.3%), the calculation becomes:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n$d_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (1.0986)$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This confirms that A is the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics and the Question\nThe problem asks for the minimum resolution of a detector required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle.\n1.  **Relativistic Motion:** The particle has a total energy (E = 27 GeV) much larger than its rest energy (E₀ = 3.41 GeV), so it's moving close to the speed of light. This means we must use special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n2.  **Decay Length:** In the laboratory's frame of reference, the particle's lifetime is longer than its proper lifetime (τ₀), so it travels a longer distance on average before decaying. This average distance is the mean decay length (λ).\n3.  **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track longer than the detector's resolution (R). If it decays before traveling a distance R, its track is not resolved.\n4.  **Probability:** Particle decay is a random, exponential process. The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is P(distance ≥ x) = e^(-x/λ).\n5.  **Putting it together:** We need to find the resolution R such that the probability of the decay length being greater than R is at least 30%. This gives the inequality: **e^(-R/λ) ≥ 0.30**.\n\n### Step 2: Perform the Calculation\n\n**A. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of total energy to rest energy.\nγ = E / E₀ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n**B. Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ):**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab. A precise formula uses the particle's momentum (p).\nFirst, find the momentum term `pc` from the energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + E₀².\n(pc)² = E² - E₀² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²\npc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV\n\nNow, calculate the mean decay length λ:\nλ = (pc / E₀) * cτ₀\nλ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)\nλ ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m)\n**λ ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m**\n\n**C. Calculate the Required Resolution (R):**\nWe need to solve the inequality e^(-R/λ) ≥ 0.30. The term \"minimum resolution\" in this context refers to the coarsest (largest) value of R that still satisfies the condition. We find this by solving the equality:\ne^(-R/λ) = 0.30\n-R/λ = ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204\nR = -λ * ln(0.30) ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.204\n**R ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Result and Select the Answer\n\nThe calculation shows that the resolution R must be less than or equal to 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m. Let's examine the options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\nOnly option C, 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m, has the correct order of magnitude. It also satisfies the condition, as 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m is indeed less than 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m.\n\n### Careful Points and Final Check\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"30%\":** The ~9% difference between our calculated value (2.27 µm) and the option (2.08 µm) is a common feature in physics problems. As several candidate answers correctly identified, if we assume \"30%\" is a rounded value for **1/3** (≈33.3%), the calculation becomes:\n    R = -λ * ln(1/3) = λ * ln(3) ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.0986\n    **R ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m**\n    This result is extremely close to the 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m given in option C, confirming it is the intended answer.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Energy\":** The 27 GeV is correctly interpreted as total energy, which is standard practice unless kinetic energy is explicitly stated.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Minimum Resolution\":** The question asks for the minimum *requirement* for the detector, which corresponds to the largest (coarsest) possible resolution value. Any finer resolution (smaller number) would also work, but 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m is the value being tested.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers, through correct physical reasoning, arrive at a value that is only consistent with 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points from the provided solutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal and Key Concepts:**\n    The question asks for the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a particle, X⁰.\n    *   **Observing a Decay:** In a tracking detector like a bubble chamber, \"observing\" a decay means the particle must travel a measurable distance before it decays.

If the particle decays after traveling a distance shorter than the detector's resolution, its track is not resolved from its creation point. Therefore, to be observed, the particle must travel a distance `d` greater than the detector's resolution `R`.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. This means its lifetime as measured in the laboratory will be significantly longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is described by an exponential decay law: $P(d \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\nThe problem, therefore, is to find the resolution `R` such that the probability of the decay distance `d` being greater than `R` is at least 30%:\n$P(d \\ge R) = e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It can be calculated in a few ways, but a robust method uses the particle's momentum.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor quantifies the relativistic effects.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{\\text{Total Energy (E)}}{\\text{Rest Mass Energy} (m_0c^2)} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Momentum (p):** We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$.\n    *   $c\\tau_0 = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) = 2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}$\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 7.853 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution (R)\nNow we solve the inequality from Step 1 for `R`.\n$e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides (and remembering to flip the inequality sign when multiplying by a negative):\n$-R/\\lambda \\ge \\ln(0.30)$\n$R \\le -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This is best interpreted as the coarsest (largest) possible resolution `R` that still satisfies the condition. Any resolution finer (smaller) than this would observe *more* than 30% of the decays. So we calculate the boundary value:\n$R_{max} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Refine\nThe calculated maximum allowed resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

The question is about observing decays, which requires the particle to survive for a distance greater than the resolution.\n*   **Numerical Precision:** The discrepancy between the initial calculation (2.27e-6 m) and the option (2.08e-6 m) highlights the importance of considering that round numbers in problem statements (like 30%) might represent more fundamental fractions (like 1/3).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the best approaches from the candidate answers and highlighting crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal and the Physics:** The question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n    *   **Physics Concepts:** This problem combines special relativity (time dilation, relativistic energy-momentum) and the statistics of particle decay (exponential decay law).\n    *   **Interpretation:** \"Observing a decay\" means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution (`d_res`). Therefore, we need to find the value of `d_res` for which the probability of the particle's travel distance being greater than `d_res` is at least 30%.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition:**\n    The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `P(distance ≥ x) = exp(-x / λ)`\n    where `λ` is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n    The condition is `P(distance ≥ d_res) ≥ 0.30`. To find the largest possible resolution that satisfies this (i.e., the minimum requirement for the detector), we solve the equality:\n    `exp(-d_res / λ) = 0.30`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n    `d_res = -λ * ln(0.30)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ):**\n    The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab. It's most accurately calculated using the particle's momentum.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Total Energy `E = 27 GeV`\n        *   Rest Mass Energy `m₀c² = 3.41 GeV`\n        *   Proper Lifetime `τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s`\n    *   **Calculate Momentum (pc):** Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`.\n        `(pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 GeV²`\n        `pc = sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.78 GeV`\n    *   **Calculate λ:** Use the formula `λ = (pc / m₀c²) * cτ₀`.\n        `λ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)`\n        `λ ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution (d_res):**\n    Now, substitute the value of `λ` into the equation from Step 2.\n    `d_res = - (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * ln(0.30)`\n    `d_res ≈ - (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)`\n    `d_res ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Resolve Discrepancy:**\n    The calculated value is `d_res ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`. The given options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\n    The calculated value is closest to option C, but it's not an exact match. As pointed out by several candidate answers (e.g., 2 and 14), this discrepancy is likely intentional. In physics problems, \"30%\" is often a rounded value for \"1/3\". Let's test this hypothesis:\n    *   Set the probability to `1/3`: `exp(-d_res / λ) = 1/3`\n    *   `d_res = -λ * ln(1/3) = λ * ln(3)`\n    *   `d_res = (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.0986 ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\n    This result, `2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is in excellent agreement with option C, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** Non-relativistic formulas would give a completely wrong answer. It is essential to use the correct relativistic equations for energy, momentum, and time dilation.\n*   **Mean Decay Length vs. Resolution:** The mean decay length (`λ ≈ 1.89 × 10⁻⁶ m`) is not the final answer. It is an intermediate value representing the average travel distance. The question asks for the distance corresponding to a specific probability (30%).\n*   **Interpretation of \"Minimum Resolution\":** In this context, \"minimum resolution\" refers to the coarsest (largest) possible resolution value that still allows for the observation of at least 30% of the decays. Any finer (smaller) resolution would observe more than 30%.\n*   **Numerical Discrepancy:** The discrepancy between the value calculated with 30% (`2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`) and the closest option (`2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`) is a key feature. Recognizing the common physics problem pattern of using \"30%\" to approximate \"1/3\" is the final step to confirming the correct option with high confidence.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, the calculation using a probability of 1/3 provides the best fit to the provided options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Physics\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰.\n*   **Observing a decay:** In a detector like a bubble chamber, \"observing\" a decay means being able to see the track of the parent particle before it decays. If the particle travels a distance shorter than the detector's resolution, its track is not resolved from its creation point. Therefore, to observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's resolution, `R`.\n*   **Decay Probability:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by `P(x) = e^(-x/L)`, where `L` is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **The Condition:** We need to find the resolution `R` such that the probability of the travel distance `d` being greater than `R` is at least 30%. This gives the inequality: `P(d > R) = e^(-R/L) ≥ 0.30`. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\", which in this context means the least stringent requirement, or the largest possible value of `R` that satisfies the condition. We solve the boundary case: `e^(-R/L) = 0.30`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L) in the Lab Frame\nThe particle is moving at relativistic speeds, so we must use formulas from special relativity. The mean decay length `L` is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. A direct way to calculate this is using the particle's momentum.\n\n1.  **Given values:**\n    *   Total Energy, `E = 27` GeV\n    *   Rest Mass Energy, `m₀c² = 3.41` GeV\n    *   Proper Lifetime, `τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶` s\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 3 × 10⁸` m/s\n\n2.  **Calculate the particle's momentum (p):**\n    The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`.\n    `(pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719` (GeV)²\n    `pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78` GeV\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay length (L):**\n    The formula for the mean decay length is `L = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀`.\n    `L = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)`\n    `L ≈ 7.854 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m)`\n    `L ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶` m\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution (R)\nNow we solve the probability equation from Step 1 using the calculated mean decay length `L`.\n\n*   `e^(-R/L) = 0.30`\n*   Take the natural logarithm of both sides: `-R/L = ln(0.30)`\n*   Solve for `R`: `R = -L * ln(0.30)`\n*   Using `ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204`:\n*   `R ≈ -(1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)`\n*   `R ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶` m\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe calculated required resolution is `R ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶` m. We must now compare this to the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nThe calculated value `2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m` is numerically very close to option D, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`.

Observing the decay implies that the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays. The condition is that this must happen for at least 30% of the particles.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physics:**\n    *   The decay of particles is a random process governed by an exponential probability law.

In a detector like a bubble chamber, observing a decay means seeing a track of the initial particle before it transforms into its decay products. If the particle decays after traveling a distance shorter than the detector's resolution, its track is not resolved from its creation point. Therefore, to observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance, $d$, that is greater than the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physical Condition:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential probability law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance of at least $d$ before decaying is given by:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n\n    The condition to observe at least 30% of the decays translates to finding the resolution $d_{res}$ such that:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\".

We therefore solve the boundary case:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length depends on the particle's properties in the lab frame.\n    *   **Relativistic Parameters:** First, we calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy ($m_0c^2$).\n        *   Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    *   **Mean Decay Length Calculation:** The most direct way to calculate the mean decay length is using the particle's momentum ($p$).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, followed by a list of careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Scenario and the Goal:**\n    The problem asks for the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a particle, $X^0$.\n    *   **Observing a decay:** In a tracking detector like a bubble chamber, this means the particle must travel a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's resolution `R` before it decays. If `d < R`, the creation and decay points are indistinguishable.\n    *   **The Condition:** The probability that the particle's travel distance `d` is greater than the resolution `R` must be at least 30%. This is written as: $P(d > R) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition using the Decay Law:**\n    The decay of unstable particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(d \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n    The condition becomes: $e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution,\" which in this context refers to the least stringent requirement, or the largest possible value of `R` that satisfies the condition. We therefore solve for the boundary case: $e^{-R/\\lambda} = 0.30$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$) in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particle is highly relativistic because its total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV). We must use formulas from special relativity.\n    *   **Calculate Momentum (pc):** First, we find the particle's momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        *   Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n        *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   **Calculate $\\lambda$:** A direct and accurate formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$.\n        *   Given: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n        *   The term $c\\tau_0$ is the distance light travels in one proper lifetime: $(3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) = 2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}$.\n        *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 7.853 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution (R):**\n    Now we solve the equation from Step 2: $R = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$.\n    *   Using $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$.\n    *   $R \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Analyze the Discrepancy:**\n    The calculated required resolution is $R \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The detector's resolution must be less than or equal to this value. Let's examine the options:\n    A) 2.08*1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08*1e-6 m\n    C) 2.08*1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08*1e-1 m\n\n    The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is of the same order of magnitude as option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. The small discrepancy is a common feature in physics problems. As many of the candidate answers correctly deduced, if we assume \"30%\" is an approximation for the fraction \"1/3\" (~33.3%), the calculation becomes:\n    *   $R = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n    *   $R \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (1.0986) \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n    This result is an extremely close match to option B, confirming it is the intended answer.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Mechanics:** The particle is highly relativistic ($\\gamma \\approx 7.9$), so using classical formulas for momentum or lifetime would be highly inaccurate. Special relativity is essential.\n*   **Proper Frame vs. Lab Frame:** The given lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is in the particle's rest frame. The decay length must be calculated in the laboratory frame, which requires accounting for time dilation, for instance by using the lab-frame momentum.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Observing a Decay\":** This must be correctly translated to the physical condition that the particle's travel distance is *greater than* the detector's resolution.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** It is crucial to use the correct formula for the probability of a particle *surviving* for a certain distance ($P(d \\ge R) = e^{-R/\\lambda}$), not the probability of it decaying within that distance.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Minimum Resolution\":** In this context, this refers to the coarsest (largest numerical value) resolution that still meets the requirement. Any finer resolution (a smaller number) would also work, but the question seeks the boundary value.\n*   **Numerical Discrepancy and Problem Design:** The slight difference between the result calculated with \"30%\" and the provided option is a strong clue. Recognizing that round percentages in physics problems often approximate fundamental fractions (like 1/3) is a key problem-solving step that confirms the correct choice with high confidence.\n\n<<<B>>>"

This means its lifetime as measured in the laboratory (the bubble chamber) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation.\n*   **Particle Decay:** The decay of individual particles is a random process governed by an exponential probability law.\n*   **Observation Condition:** In a tracking detector, \"observing\" a decay means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($R_{res}$) before it decays. If it travels a shorter distance, its track is not resolved from its creation point.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the resolution $R_{res}$ such that the probability of the particle's travel distance ($d$) being greater than $R_{res}$ is at least 30%. The condition is: $P(d > R_{res}) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor quantifies the time dilation.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{\\text{Total Energy (E)}}{\\text{Rest Energy} (m_0c^2)} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($p$):** This is needed for a precise calculation of the decay length. We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$):** A direct formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$.\n    *   $c\\tau_0 = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) = 2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}$\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution ($R_{res}$)\nThe probability of a particle traveling a distance $d$ or more is $P(d > R_{res}) = e^{-R_{res}/\\lambda}$. We need this probability to be at least 0.30. To find the boundary condition (the largest permissible resolution), we solve the equality:\n$e^{-R_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{R_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$R_{res} = \\lambda \\times 1.204 \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThe resolution must be less than or equal to this value: $R_{res} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Final Analysis\n\nThe given options are:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nOur calculated maximum allowed resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   Options A and D are too large (poorer resolution) and would not observe 30% of the decays.\n*   Option B is a valid resolution, but it is much finer than necessary.\n*   Option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the only value that is both of the correct order of magnitude and satisfies the condition ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$).\n\n**A careful point on problem design:** It is common in physics problems for percentages like \"30%\" to be approximations of simple fractions. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended value was 1/3 (~33.3%).\n*   $e^{-R_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n*   $R_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This strongly suggests that the problem was designed with the 1/3 fraction in mind, making C the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Scenario:** The problem involves a high-energy particle ($X^0$) that decays. Because its energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), it is moving at a speed very close to the speed of light. This requires the use of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Question:** The goal is to find the \"minimum resolution\" needed to \"observe at least 30% of the decays.\"\n    *   **Observing a decay:** In a tracking detector like a bubble chamber, \"observing\" a decay means being able to distinguish the particle's track from its creation point to its decay point. This is only possible if the particle travels a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution, `R`.\n    *   **At least 30%:** Particle decay is a random, exponential process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `d` or more before decaying is given by the survival probability $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame. The condition is to find the resolution `R` such that $e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n    *   **Minimum Resolution:** This refers to the least stringent requirement, meaning the largest possible value for the resolution `R` that still satisfies the condition. We therefore solve for the boundary case: $R = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying.\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which quantifies the relativistic effects.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{\\text{Total Energy}}{\\text{Rest Mass Energy}} = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n    *   Next, calculate the particle's momentum, `p`. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   The mean decay length $\\lambda$ can be calculated precisely using the formula:\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$\n        Given the proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and the speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution (R):**\n    *   Using the condition from Step 2: $R = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n    *   $R \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    *   $R \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Refine Interpretation:**\n    *   The calculated value is $R \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

The distance traveled is in the lab frame, so the time-dilated lifetime ($\\tau = \\gamma\\tau_0$) or an equivalent relativistic formula for decay length must be used.\n*   **Decay Probability:** The core of the problem relies on the exponential decay law, $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, which gives the probability of a particle surviving for a distance `d` or more.\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Minimum Resolution\":** This term refers to the coarsest (largest) resolution that can still achieve the goal, not the smallest possible number.\n*   **Approximations in Problem Statements:** The discrepancy between the calculation with 30% and the provided options highlights that values in physics problems can sometimes be rounded or be approximations (like 30% for 1/3), and checking for such possibilities can lead to a more precise match.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, the calculation assuming the condition is to observe at least 1/3 of the decays provides the best fit to the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the minimum resolution of a detector required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Physics:**\n    *   **Observing a Decay:** In a tracking detector like a bubble chamber, \"observing\" a decay means being able to distinguish the track of the parent particle ($X^0$) from its creation point before it decays into its daughter particles ($Y^+Z^-$). This requires the parent particle to travel a distance ($d$) that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($R$).\n    *   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle has a total energy (27 GeV) much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. Its lifetime in the lab frame will be significantly longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation.\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of individual particles is a random process. The probability that a particle travels a distance greater than $R$ before decaying follows an exponential law: $P(d > R) = e^{-R/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition:**\n    We need the probability of observing the decay to be at least 30% (0.30).\n    $P(d > R) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n    To find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $R = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab.

In a detector like a bubble chamber, observing a decay means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays. If the track is shorter than the resolution, it cannot be distinguished from the creation point.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physical Condition:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(x \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame and $d_{res}$ is the detector resolution.\n    We need to find the resolution $d_{res}$ such that this probability is at least 30% (0.3).\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.3$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length depends on the particle's properties in the lab frame, which are affected by special relativity.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy ($m_0c^2$).\n        *   Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. A direct and accurate way to calculate it is using the particle's momentum ($p$).\n        *   First, find the momentum from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} \\approx 26.78$ GeV.\n        *   The formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\tau_0$.\n        *   Given: Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n        *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$):** Now we solve the probability equation from Step 2. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution,\" which in this context means the least stringent (i.e., largest) resolution that still meets the condition. We solve for the boundary case:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.3$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.3) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Finalize:**\n    *   The calculated required resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    *   The given options are:\n        A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n        B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n        C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n        D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    *   The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close in magnitude to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The other options are off by several orders of magnitude.\n    *   The small discrepancy (~9%) is very common in such problems and is likely due to the given values being slightly rounded.\n    *   As noted by some agents, if we assume \"30%\" is an approximation for \"1/3\" (~33.3%), the calculation yields $d_{res} = \\lambda \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is almost identical to option C. This provides strong evidence that C is the intended answer.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativity is Key:** Non-relativistic formulas would give a completely wrong answer. Time dilation and the relativistic energy-momentum relation are essential.\n*   **Mean Decay Length:** The calculation must be done in the lab frame, using the time-dilated lifetime or the relativistic momentum.\n*   **Probability Interpretation:** \"Observe at least 30% of decays\" means the probability of the decay length being *greater than* the resolution is at least 0.3.\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculated value may not perfectly match an option due to rounding in the problem statement. The closest option with the correct order of magnitude is the correct choice. Many of the provided candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but misidentified the letter corresponding to the correct numerical answer.\n\nThe most thorough analyses correctly identify the calculation steps and conclude that the value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is the correct answer, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points and evaluating the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Interpret the Physics\nThe core task is to find the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" the decay of a particle.\n*   **Observing a decay:** In a tracking detector like a bubble chamber, this means the particle must travel a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's resolution `R` before it decays. If `d < R`, the creation and decay points are indistinguishable.\n*   **\"At least 30% of the decays\":** This sets a statistical condition. The probability that a particle's travel distance `d` is greater than the resolution `R` must be at least 0.30.\n    *   `P(d > R) ≥ 0.30`\n*   **\"Minimum resolution\":** This phrase can be ambiguous. In this context, it refers to the coarsest (i.e., largest numerical value) resolution `R` that still satisfies the condition. Any resolution finer (smaller) than this would also work, but the question asks for the boundary value. We therefore solve for the equality: `P(d > R) = 0.30`.\n\n### Step 2: Relativistic Calculations\nThe particle is highly relativistic, so we must use formulas from special relativity.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Total Energy, `E = 27 GeV`\n*   Rest Mass Energy, `m₀c² = 3.41 GeV`\n*   Proper Lifetime, `τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s`\n\n**Calculation of Mean Decay Length (λ):**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. The most direct way to calculate this is using the particle's momentum.\n\n1.  **Find the momentum (`p`):** Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`.\n    *   `(pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²`\n    *   `pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78 GeV`\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length (`λ`):** The formula is `λ = (pc / m₀c²) * cτ₀`.\n    *   `cτ₀` is the distance light travels in one proper lifetime: `(2.998 × 10⁸ m/s) × (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m`.\n    *   `λ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\n\nThis value `λ ≈ 1.885 µm` is the average distance the particle travels.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Decay Probability Law\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance `d` or more is given by the exponential decay law: `P(d) = e^(-d/λ)`. We need to find the resolution `R` such that `P(R) = 0.30`.\n\n*   `e^(-R/λ) = 0.30`\n*   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `-R/λ = ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204`\n*   Solving for `R`: `R = λ * 1.204 ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.204 ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Final Analysis\n\nOur calculated required resolution is `R ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`.

Key Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** The particle is moving at a high speed, so its lifetime in the lab frame (`τ`) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ₀`) by a factor of `γ` (the Lorentz factor).\n*   **Mean Decay Length:** The average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is called the mean decay length (`λ`).\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by `P(d > x) = e^(-x/λ)`.\n\n### **3.

The initial values in the problem (mass, energy, lifetime) were slightly rounded when the problem was created.\n2.  The problem intended for \"30%\" to be an approximation of \"1/3\".

If it decays before traveling this distance, its track is too short to be resolved from its creation point.\n*   **At least 30%:** This sets up a probability condition. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $d \\ge d_{res}$ must be at least 0.30.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic.

This means we must use special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n2.  **Decay Length:** In the laboratory's frame of reference, the particle's lifetime is longer than its proper lifetime (τ₀), so it travels a longer distance on average before decaying. This average distance is the mean decay length (λ).\n3.  **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track longer than the detector's resolution (R). If it decays before traveling a distance R, its track is not resolved.\n4.  **Probability:** Particle decay is a random, exponential process. The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is P(distance ≥ x) = e^(-x/λ).\n5.  **Putting it together:** We need to find the resolution R such that the probability of the decay length being greater than R is at least 30%.

We must use principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of individual particles is a random process governed by an exponential probability law.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Condition:**\n    We need to find the resolution `R` such that the probability of the decay length `d` being greater than or equal to `R` is at least 30% (0.30).\n    The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(d \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n    The condition is: $e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution,\" which in this context refers to the least stringent requirement, or the largest possible value of `R` that satisfies the condition.

The other options differ by orders of magnitude. The small ~9% discrepancy is common in such problems and is likely due to the problem's input values being chosen to lead to a round-numbered option.\n\n    Furthermore, as noted by some candidate answers, if we assume \"30%\" was an approximation for \"1/3\" (~33.3%), the calculation becomes:\n    *   $R = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n    *   $R \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (1.0986) \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n    This result is extremely close to option C, strengthening the conclusion that it is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** It is essential to use the correct relativistic formulas for energy, momentum, and time dilation. Classical approximations would be highly inaccurate.\n*   **Lab Frame vs. Proper Frame:** All calculations for distances traveled in the detector must be performed in the laboratory frame, using the time-dilated lifetime or the lab-frame momentum.\n*   **Decay Probability:** The condition \"observe at least 30%\" corresponds to the fraction of particles that *survive* for a distance greater than the resolution, which is described by $P(d > R) = e^{-R/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Numerical Discrepancy:** One must be prepared for small differences between the calculated answer and the provided options in multiple-choice physics questions and choose the closest plausible option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Physics\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a particle.\n*   **Observing a decay:** In a tracking detector like a bubble chamber, observing a decay means being able to see the track of the parent particle before it decays into its daughter particles. If the particle decays after traveling a distance shorter than the detector's resolution, its track is not resolved from its creation point. Therefore, to be observed, the particle must travel a distance `d` greater than the detector's resolution `R`.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. This means its lifetime as measured in the laboratory will be significantly longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is described by an exponential decay law: $P(d \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\nThe problem, therefore, is to find the resolution `R` such that the probability of the decay distance `d` being greater than `R` is at least 30%:\n$P(d \\ge R) = e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It can be calculated in a few ways, but a robust method uses the particle's momentum.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor quantifies the relativistic effects.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{\\text{Total Energy (E)}}{\\text{Rest Mass Energy} (m_0c^2)} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Momentum (p):** We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$.\n    *   $c\\tau_0 = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) = 2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}$\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 7.853 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution (R)\nNow we solve the inequality from Step 1 for `R`.\n$e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides (and remembering to flip the inequality sign when multiplying by a negative):\n$-R/\\lambda \\ge \\ln(0.30)$\n$R \\le -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This is best interpreted as the coarsest (largest) possible resolution `R` that still satisfies the condition. Any resolution finer (smaller) than this would observe *more* than 30% of the decays. So we calculate the boundary value:\n$R_{max} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Refine\nThe calculated maximum allowed resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The options are:\nA) 2.08*1e-6 m\nB) 2.08*1e-1 m\nC) 2.08*1e-3 m\nD) 2.08*1e-9 m\n\nThe only options that satisfy the condition $R \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m are A and D. However, option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically very close to our calculated boundary. The small discrepancy is a common feature in physics problems.\n\nAs noted by several of the provided answers, the discrepancy can be almost perfectly resolved by assuming that \"30%\" is a rounded value for the fraction 1/3 (~33.3%). Let's re-calculate with this assumption:\n$R = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n$R = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (1.0986) \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is in excellent agreement with option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This confirms that A is the intended answer.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** It is essential to use the correct formulas for relativistic energy, momentum, and time dilation.\n*   **Proper vs. Lab Frame:** The calculation must be performed in the laboratory frame, using the time-dilated lifetime or the corresponding mean decay length.\n*   **Decay Probability:** The probability of a particle *surviving* to a certain distance follows the exponential law $e^{-x/\\lambda}$. The question is about observing decays, which requires the particle to survive for a distance greater than the resolution.\n*   **Numerical Precision:** The discrepancy between the initial calculation (2.27e-6 m) and the option (2.08e-6 m) highlights the importance of considering that round numbers in problem statements (like 30%) might represent more fundamental fractions (like 1/3).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the best approaches from the candidate answers and highlighting crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal and the Physics:** The question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n    *   **Physics Concepts:** This problem combines special relativity (time dilation, relativistic energy-momentum) and the statistics of particle decay (exponential decay law).\n    *   **Interpretation:** \"Observing a decay\" means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution (`d_res`). Therefore, we need to find the value of `d_res` for which the probability of the particle's travel distance being greater than `d_res` is at least 30%.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition:**\n    The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `P(distance ≥ x) = exp(-x / λ)`\n    where `λ` is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n    The condition is `P(distance ≥ d_res) ≥ 0.30`. To find the largest possible resolution that satisfies this (i.e., the minimum requirement for the detector), we solve the equality:\n    `exp(-d_res / λ) = 0.30`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n    `d_res = -λ * ln(0.30)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ):**\n    The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab. It's most accurately calculated using the particle's momentum.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Total Energy `E = 27 GeV`\n        *   Rest Mass Energy `m₀c² = 3.41 GeV`\n        *   Proper Lifetime `τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s`\n    *   **Calculate Momentum (pc):** Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`.\n        `(pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 GeV²`\n        `pc = sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.78 GeV`\n    *   **Calculate λ:** Use the formula `λ = (pc / m₀c²) * cτ₀`.\n        `λ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)`\n        `λ ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution (d_res):**\n    Now, substitute the value of `λ` into the equation from Step 2.\n    `d_res = - (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * ln(0.30)`\n    `d_res ≈ - (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)`\n    `d_res ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Resolve Discrepancy:**\n    The calculated value is `d_res ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`. The given options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\n    The calculated value is closest to option C, but it's not an exact match. As pointed out by several candidate answers (e.g., 2 and 14), this discrepancy is likely intentional. In physics problems, \"30%\" is often a rounded value for \"1/3\". Let's test this hypothesis:\n    *   Set the probability to `1/3`: `exp(-d_res / λ) = 1/3`\n    *   `d_res = -λ * ln(1/3) = λ * ln(3)`\n    *   `d_res = (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.0986 ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\n    This result, `2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is in excellent agreement with option C, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** Non-relativistic formulas would give a completely wrong answer. It is essential to use the correct relativistic equations for energy, momentum, and time dilation.\n*   **Mean Decay Length vs. Resolution:** The mean decay length (`λ ≈ 1.89 × 10⁻⁶ m`) is not the final answer. It is an intermediate value representing the average travel distance. The question asks for the distance corresponding to a specific probability (30%).\n*   **Interpretation of \"Minimum Resolution\":** In this context, \"minimum resolution\" refers to the coarsest (largest) possible resolution value that still allows for the observation of at least 30% of the decays.

Recognizing the common physics problem pattern of using \"30%\" to approximate \"1/3\" is the final step to confirming the correct option with high confidence.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, the calculation using a probability of 1/3 provides the best fit to the provided options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Physics\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰.\n*   **Observing a decay:** In a detector like a bubble chamber, \"observing\" a decay means being able to see the track of the parent particle before it decays. If the particle travels a distance shorter than the detector's resolution, its track is not resolved from its creation point. Therefore, to observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's resolution, `R`.\n*   **Decay Probability:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by `P(x) = e^(-x/L)`, where `L` is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **The Condition:** We need to find the resolution `R` such that the probability of the travel distance `d` being greater than `R` is at least 30%. This gives the inequality: `P(d > R) = e^(-R/L) ≥ 0.30`. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\", which in this context means the least stringent requirement, or the largest possible value of `R` that satisfies the condition. We solve the boundary case: `e^(-R/L) = 0.30`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L) in the Lab Frame\nThe particle is moving at relativistic speeds, so we must use formulas from special relativity.

One must not confuse this with the probability of decaying *within* a distance `d`.\n*   **Problem Design:** The discrepancy between the result from using \"30%\" and the provided options, versus the excellent match when using \"1/3\", is a strong clue about the problem's intended design.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most plausible answer is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully executed the plan to determine the required detector resolution.\n\nFirst, it calculated the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) of the $X^0$ particle in the laboratory frame using the principles of special relativity. The result was approximately $1.88 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\nNext, it addressed the condition of observing \"at least 30% of the decays\". By interpreting this as finding the resolution `d` for which the probability of a particle traveling further than `d` is 1/3 (a common approximation for 30% in such problems), it solved the equation $d = \\lambda \\times \\ln(3)$.\n\nThe final calculated resolution was $2.0695 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters. This value is extremely close to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters. The minor discrepancy is likely due to rounding of the initial values (mass, energy, or lifetime) provided in the problem statement.\n\n<<<answer content>>>\nD\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum spatial resolution required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. In a detector like a bubble chamber, observing a decay means seeing a track of the initial particle before it transforms into its decay products. If the particle decays after traveling a distance shorter than the detector's resolution, its track is not resolved from its creation point. Therefore, to observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance, $d$, that is greater than the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physical Condition:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential probability law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance of at least $d$ before decaying is given by:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n\n    The condition to observe at least 30% of the decays translates to finding the resolution $d_{res}$ such that:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". This is typically interpreted as the least stringent requirement, meaning the largest possible value of $d_{res}$ that still satisfies the condition. We therefore solve the boundary case:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length depends on the particle's properties in the lab frame.\n    *   **Relativistic Parameters:** First, we calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy ($m_0c^2$).\n        *   Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    *   **Mean Decay Length Calculation:** The most direct way to calculate the mean decay length is using the particle's momentum ($p$). We first find the momentum from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n        Now, we use the formula for the mean decay length: $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n        *   Given: Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n        *   $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        *   $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$):** Now we use the formula from Step 2 with our calculated mean decay length $\\lambda$.\n    *   $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n    *   $d_{res} \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    *   $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated required resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We must find the closest option provided.\n    *   A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    *   B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    *   C) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    *   D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\n    The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically closest to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The other options differ by several orders of magnitude. The small discrepancy (~9%) is common in such problems and is likely due to the given values being chosen to lead to an answer near one of the options.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical:** The particle's energy is much larger than its rest mass, so relativistic formulas must be used.\n*   **Proper vs. Lab Frame:** The lifetime given ($\\tau_0$) is the proper lifetime. All calculations for distances in the bubble chamber must use the time-dilated lifetime or equivalent lab-frame quantities like momentum.\n*   **Decay Statistics:** The decay process is exponential. The probability of *survival* to a certain distance is $e^{-x/\\lambda}$, which corresponds to the fraction of decays that are \"observable\" if the resolution is $x$.\n*   **\"Minimum Resolution\" Ambiguity:** In this context, \"minimum resolution\" refers to the coarsest (largest numerical value) resolution that can still achieve the goal, which sets the upper bound for $d_{res}$. Any resolution finer (smaller) than this would observe more than 30% of the decays.\n*   **The \"1/3\" Trick:** In many physics problems, a value like \"30%\" is a rounded approximation for a cleaner fraction. If we recalculate with a requirement of observing $1/3$ of the decays, we get $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This result is extremely close to option D, strengthening the conclusion that it is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal and Interpret Key Phrases:**\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\" needed to \"observe at least 30% of the decays.\"\n    *   **Observing a decay**: In a tracking detector like a bubble chamber, observing a decay means being able to see the track of the parent particle before it decays into its products. If the particle decays after traveling a distance shorter than the detector's resolution, its track is not resolved from its creation point. Therefore, to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance `d` greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n    *   **At least 30%**: This sets up a probability condition. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `d > d_res` must be 30% or more.\n    *   **Minimum resolution**: This can be ambiguous. However, in this context, it refers to the coarsest (i.e., largest numerical value) resolution that still satisfies the 30% condition. Any resolution finer (smaller) than this would observe more than 30% of the decays.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physical Condition:**\n    Particle decay follows an exponential probability law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `d` or more is given by:\n    $P(d \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n    The condition is:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n    To find the boundary value for the resolution, we solve the equality:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The particle is relativistic, so we must use formulas from special relativity.\n    *   **Given**:\n        *   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n    *   **Calculate Momentum ($pc$)**: The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    *   **Calculate Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: A direct and accurate formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx 7.853 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$):**\n    Now we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ into the equation from Step 2.\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated required resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We compare this to the given options:\n    *   A) 2.08*1e-1 m\n    *   B) 2.08*1e-9 m\n    *   C) 2.08*1e-3 m\n    *   D) 2.08*1e-6 m\n\n    The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically closest to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The other options differ by several orders of magnitude and are therefore incorrect. The ~9% discrepancy between the calculated value and the option value is a common feature in such problems and is likely due to slight rounding or inconsistencies in the problem's given constants.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Energy Interpretation**: The 27 GeV should be treated as the total relativistic energy ($E$), not kinetic energy, which is the standard convention unless stated otherwise.\n*   **Decay Probability**: It is crucial to use the formula for the probability of *survival* beyond a certain distance ($P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$), not the probability of decaying *within* that distance.\n*   **Relativistic Calculations**: Non-relativistic (classical) formulas for momentum or lifetime would yield a completely wrong result.\n*   **Numerical Discrepancy**: One must be prepared for a small difference between the calculated answer and the provided options in multiple-choice questions. The correct choice is the one with the right order of magnitude and the closest numerical value.\n\nBased on the thorough calculation, the required resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which makes $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
