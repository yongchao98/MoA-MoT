This is a standard problem in quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Identify the State Vector and Operator:**\n    *   The state of the system is `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n    *   The observable is `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`.\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue 0:**\n    The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator. We are interested in the outcome `λ = 0`. The first step is to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to this eigenvalue by solving the equation `P|v₀⟩ = λ|v₀⟩`.\n    For `λ = 0`, this becomes `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n    Letting `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`, we get the system of equations:\n    *   `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    *   `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n    This shows that any vector of the form `[c, 0, -c]` (where `c` is a non-zero constant) is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0. For simplicity, we can choose `c=1`, giving the representative eigenvector `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by the squared projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. The most general formula, which accounts for unnormalized vectors, is:\n    `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\n    We now calculate each term for `λ = 0`:\n    *   **Inner Product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`**: This is the dot product of the eigenvector `[1, 0, -1]` and the state vector `[-1, 2, 1]`.\n        `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`.\n        The squared magnitude is `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`.\n\n    *   **Squared Norm of the Eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`**:\n        `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = (1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.\n\n    *   **Squared Norm of the State Vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**:\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n    *   **Final Probability Calculation**:\n        `Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** Nearly all candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the numerical result of 1/3. This indicates a high degree of confidence in the mathematical procedure.\n*   **Normalization:** The use of the formula `|⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)` correctly handles the fact that neither the initial state vector nor the chosen representative eigenvector were normalized. Alternatively, normalizing both vectors first and then calculating `|⟨v_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²` yields the same result: `|-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The calculated probability is 1/3. The question provides the options: A) 2/3, B) 1, C) √2/3, D) 1/3. The correct choice is therefore D. Several candidate answers incorrectly mapped their correct numerical result to the wrong letter.\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo decide the final answer, I will perform a step-by-step verification of the calculation based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core task is to calculate the probability of a specific measurement outcome in a quantum system. According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, this probability is determined by projecting the system's state vector onto the eigenvector associated with the measurement outcome.\n\nThe formula for the probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` of an observable for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector of the observable corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the two vectors.\n*   `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` and `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` are the squared norms of the vectors, which account for the fact that the given vectors may not be normalized.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Identify the given vectors and operator:**\n    *   State vector: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n    *   Observable operator: `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n    *   The desired measurement outcome is the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ = 0`:**\n    We must solve the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`, which simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n    Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    ```\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n    ```\n    This matrix equation yields a system of linear equations:\n    *   `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    *   `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]` for any non-zero constant `c`. For simplicity, we can choose `c=1`, giving the unnormalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the components for the probability formula:**\n    *   **Inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`**:\n        `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] . [-1, 2, 1]^T = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -2`\n    *   **Squared magnitude `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`**:\n        `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`\n    *   **Squared norm of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**:\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n    *   **Squared norm of the eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`**:\n        `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n\n4.  **Compute the final probability:**\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    `Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers that show their work (e.g., answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17) correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the numerical result of **1/3**.\n*   **Normalization:** A critical point is to correctly handle the normalization of the state vector and the eigenvector. The formula `|⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)` correctly accounts for this. Several answers (e.g., 3, 7, 9, 13, 17) use this method flawlessly. Other answers (e.g., 1, 2, 10, 11, 14, 16) first normalize the vectors and then compute the squared inner product, `|⟨v_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²`, which also correctly yields `1/3`.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The most common error among the candidate answers is incorrectly mapping the correct numerical result (`1/3`) to the given options: A) 1, B) 2/3, C) 1/3, D) √2/3. The correct choice for the answer `1/3` is **C**. Many candidates calculated `1/3` but selected A, B, or D.\n*   **Conclusion:** The calculation robustly and consistently yields `1/3`.

The Formula**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` can be calculated using the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\nThis formula is robust as it does not require the state vector `|ψ⟩` or the eigenvector `|v_λ⟩` to be normalized beforehand.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Identify the vectors and operator.**\n    *   State vector: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n    *   Observable operator: `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n*   **Step B: Find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.**\n    We need to solve the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]`. We can choose a simple, unnormalized representative by setting `c=1`:\n    `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the terms for the probability formula.**\n    1.  **Inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`**:\n        `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`\n        So, `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`.\n\n    2.  **Squared norm of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**:\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n    3.  **Squared norm of the eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`**:\n        `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = (1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate the final probability.**\n    `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v₀|v₀⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n    `Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6)`\n    `Prob(0) = 4 / 12`\n    `Prob(0) = 1/3`\n\n**4.

The most general formula, which works for unnormalized state vectors and eigenvectors, is:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector of the observable corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the two vectors.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` and `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` are the squared norms of the respective vectors.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Using the Correct Formula.** It is crucial to account for the normalization of both the state vector and the eigenvector. The formula above does this explicitly. An alternative is to normalize both vectors first and then calculate the squared magnitude of their inner product.\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0**\nFirst, we must find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that satisfies the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\nLet `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n```\n[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n```\nThis matrix equation gives a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\n**Careful Point 2: Correctly Solving for the Eigenvector.** The solution shows that any vector of the form `[c, 0, -c]` (where `c` is a non-zero constant) is a valid eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0. For simplicity, we can choose `c=1`, giving the unnormalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Components for the Probability Formula**\nWe have:\n*   State vector: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   Eigenvector: `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\nNow we compute each term in the formula:\n*   **Inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`\n*   **Squared magnitude `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`**:\n    `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`\n*   **Squared norm of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n*   **Squared norm of the eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`**:\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = (1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n\n**Careful Point 3: Accurate Arithmetic.** Each of these calculations must be performed without error. The given state vector `|ψ⟩` is not normalized (`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 6`), so this term is essential.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Probability**\nSubstitute the calculated values back into the formula:\n`Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\n**Careful Point 4: Correctly Assembling the Final Result.** The final step is to combine the components correctly. A common mistake would be to forget one of the normalization terms in the denominator.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0 is 1/3. This corresponds to option A.

The standard procedure in quantum mechanics is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the State Vector and Operator:**\n    *   State vector: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n    *   Observable operator: `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n    We must solve the eigenvalue equation `P|v₀⟩ = λ|v₀⟩` for `λ = 0`. This simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n    Let the eigenvector be `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    ```\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n    ```\n    This matrix equation yields a system of linear equations:\n    *   `(1/√2)y = 0`  ⇒ `y = 0`\n    *   `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` ⇒ `x + z = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\n    The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is of the form `[c, 0, -c]` for any non-zero constant `c`. For simplicity, we can choose `c=1`, giving an unnormalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by the formula that correctly accounts for unnormalized vectors:\n    `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\n    Let's calculate each component for `λ = 0`:\n    *   **Inner Product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`**:\n        `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] .

The probability formula must account for this, either by normalizing the state vector at the start or by including the `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` term in the denominator of the final calculation. Forgetting this is a frequent error.\n2.  **Eigenvector Choice:** Using an unnormalized eigenvector (like `[1, 0, -1]`) is perfectly fine, as long as its squared norm (`⟨v₀|v₀⟩`) is also included in the denominator. Any normalization constant cancels out.\n3.  **Calculation Accuracy:** The steps involve basic matrix and vector algebra. Simple arithmetic errors, especially with signs, can lead to an incorrect result. The inner product is `-1 - 1 = -2`, not 0.\n4.  **Matching Answer to Option:** The calculated numerical result must be correctly matched with the given options. The calculation clearly yields `1/3`, which corresponds to option B.

The foundational principle for this calculation is the Born rule in quantum mechanics.\n\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. The general formula, which accommodates unnormalized vectors, is:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector of the observable corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨...|...⟩` denotes the inner product.\n\n**Step 1: Find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ = 0.**\n\nFirst, we must find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that satisfies the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\nLet `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n```\n[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n```\nThis matrix equation yields a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  ⇒ `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` ⇒ `x + z = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]` for any non-zero constant `c`. We can choose a simple, unnormalized eigenvector by setting `c = 1`:\n`|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the components of the probability formula.**\n\nWe use the given state vector `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T` and the found eigenvector `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n*   **Inner Product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`\n    The squared magnitude is `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`.\n\n*   **Squared Norm of the Eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`**:\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = (1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Squared Norm of the State Vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final probability.**\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the probability formula:\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v₀|v₀⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n`Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n1.  **Normalization:** The given state vector `|ψ⟩` is not normalized (`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 6`, not 1). The general probability formula correctly handles this by dividing by the squared norms of both the state vector and the eigenvector. Forgetting this is a common error.\n2.  **Calculation Accuracy:** The calculation involves simple vector algebra. The inner product is -2, its square is 4. The squared norms are 2 and 6. The final fraction is `4 / (2 * 6)`, which simplifies to `1/3`.\n3.  **Matching Answer to Option:** The calculated probability is `1/3`. This corresponds to option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly perform the calculation to arrive at `1/3`, several incorrectly map this result to options A, B, or C.\n\nThe correct calculation consistently yields a probability of 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1.

[-1, 2, 1]^T = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n**Step D: Compute the final probability.**\nUsing the formula `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v₀|v₀⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`:\n`Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\n### 4. Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points\n*   The overwhelming majority of the provided candidate answers perform the calculation correctly and arrive at the numerical result of 1/3.\n*   A significant number of candidates (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17) correctly calculate the value 1/3 but then incorrectly select the final answer option (e.g., choosing <<<C>>> or <<<D>>>).

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the probability of measuring a specific value (an eigenvalue) for a given observable in a quantum system. The principles of quantum mechanics dictate how to calculate this probability.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   **State vector:** The state of the system is `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`. This vector is not normalized.\n*   **Observable operator:** The observable `P` is represented by the matrix `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`.\n*   **Measurement Outcome:** We are interested in the probability of measuring the value `0`. This value must be an eigenvalue of the operator `P`.\n\n**3. The Physics Formula**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the Born rule. The most general formula, which works for unnormalized vectors, is:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\nWhere:\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector of the observable `P` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the eigenvector and the state vector.\n*   `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` is the squared norm of the eigenvector.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the squared norm of the state vector.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step a: Find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.**\nWe need to solve the equation `P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩` for `λ = 0`. This simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\nLet the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` be `[x, y, z]^T`.\n```\n[[0,   1/√2, 0  ],\n [1/√2, 0,   1/√2],\n [0,   1/√2, 0  ]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n```\nThis matrix equation expands into a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\nThe eigenvector has the form `[c, 0, -c]` for any non-zero constant `c`. We can choose a simple representative vector by setting `c = 1`.\nSo, an unnormalized eigenvector is `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step b: Calculate the components of the probability formula.**\n*   **Calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] . [-1, 2, 1]^T = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`.\n*   **Calculate the squared magnitude `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`:**\n    `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`.\n*   **Calculate the squared norm of the eigenvector, `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.\n*   **Calculate the squared norm of the state vector, `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n**Step c: Calculate the final probability.**\nNow we substitute these values into the probability formula:\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v₀|v₀⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\n**5.

Understand the Goal and the Formula**\nThe question asks for the probability of measuring the value 0 for the observable `P`. The value 0 must be an eigenvalue of the operator `P`. The probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the Born rule.

The formula above does this explicitly. An alternative is to normalize both vectors first and then calculate the squared magnitude of their inner product.\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0**\nFirst, we must find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that satisfies the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\nLet `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n```\n[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n```\nThis matrix equation gives a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\n**Careful Point 2: Correctly Solving for the Eigenvector.** The solution shows that any vector of the form `[c, 0, -c]` (where `c` is a non-zero constant) is a valid eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0.

The standard procedure in quantum mechanics is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the State Vector and Operator:**\n    *   State vector: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n    *   Observable operator: `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n    We must solve the eigenvalue equation `P|v₀⟩ = λ|v₀⟩` for `λ = 0`. This simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n    Let the eigenvector be `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    ```\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n    ```\n    This matrix equation yields a system of linear equations:\n    *   `(1/√2)y = 0`  ⇒ `y = 0`\n    *   `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` ⇒ `x + z = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\n    The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is of the form `[c, 0, -c]` for any non-zero constant `c`. For simplicity, we can choose `c=1`, giving an unnormalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by the formula that correctly accounts for unnormalized vectors:\n    `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\n    Let's calculate each component for `λ = 0`:\n    *   **Inner Product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`**:\n        `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] .

The probability formula must account for this, either by normalizing the state vector at the start or by including the `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` term in the denominator of the final calculation. Forgetting this is a frequent error.\n2.  **Eigenvector Choice:** Using an unnormalized eigenvector (like `[1, 0, -1]`) is perfectly fine, as long as its squared norm (`⟨v₀|v₀⟩`) is also included in the denominator. Any normalization constant cancels out.\n3.  **Calculation Accuracy:** The steps involve basic matrix and vector algebra. Simple arithmetic errors, especially with signs, can lead to an incorrect result. The inner product is `-1 - 1 = -2`, not 0.\n4.  **Matching Answer to Option:** The calculated numerical result must be correctly matched with the given options.

We are interested in the outcome `λ = 0`. The corresponding eigenvector `|v₀⟩` is found by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\n    Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    The matrix equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0` gives the system of linear equations:\n    *   `(1/√2)y = 0`  ⇒ `y = 0`\n    *   `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` ⇒ `x + z = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\n    Therefore, any eigenvector for `λ = 0` is of the form `[k, 0, -k]^T`. We can choose a simple, unnormalized representative by setting `k=1`, so `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability `Prob(λ)` is given by the Born rule.

This value must be an eigenvalue of the operator `P`.\n\n**3. The Relevant Physics Formula**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` of an observable `P` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector of `P` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the eigenvector and the state vector.\n*   `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` is the squared norm of the eigenvector.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the squared norm of the state vector.\n\nThis formula works with unnormalized vectors, which simplifies the calculation as we don't need to normalize them first, but we must remember to include their norms in the denominator.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 4a: Find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.**\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue equation `P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩` for `λ = 0`. This simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\nLet the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` be `[x, y, z]^T`.\n```\n[[0,   1/√2, 0  ],\n [1/√2, 0,   1/√2],\n [0,   1/√2, 0  ]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n```\nThis matrix equation expands into a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nThe eigenvector has the form `[c, 0, -c]^T` for any non-zero constant `c`.
