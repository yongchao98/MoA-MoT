Understanding the Problem\nWe need to find the total potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V=0). The charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble this configuration, specifically, the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\n### 2. Method of Images\nThis problem is a classic application of the \"method of images\". This powerful technique allows us to replace the complex problem of a charge and a conductor with a simpler problem involving only point charges that replicate the electric field in the region of interest (outside the sphere).\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field and potential outside the sphere can be perfectly mimicked by:\n1.  The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n2.  An \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nThe magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at a distance R from the center) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the line connecting the center to `q`)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of this system.\n\n#### Method A: Using the Work Integral\nThe potential energy `U` is the work `W` done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. The work is done against the electric force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere.\n`U = - ∫_∞^d F_electric · dr`\n\nThe force on charge `q` due to the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. Let's say `q` is moved along the x-axis from `x = ∞` to `x = d`. The force on `q` when it is at a position `x` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\nThe image charge `q'` at this point is `-qR/x` and its position is `R^2/x`. The distance between them is `x - R^2/x`.\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThe force is attractive (negative sign). The work done by the electric field is `W_field = ∫_∞^d F(x) dx`. The potential energy is `U = -W_field`.\n`U = - ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^d x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\nUsing substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`:\n`∫ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx = (1/2) ∫ u^-2 du = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞)))]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n#### Method B: Using the General Energy Formula\nA more direct method uses the general formula for the electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges in the system.\n\nFor our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere, which has a total induced charge `Q_induced`.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * Q_induced * V_sphere`\n\n1.  Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. So the second term is zero.\n2.  `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThe beauty of the method of images is that this potential, `V_at_q`, is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   Location of `q` is `d`.\n*   Image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result. The potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere is an equipotential surface with a potential of V=0. The presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the **Method of Images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is V=0 on the surface of the sphere (at radius `r=R`).\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nIt can be shown that the boundary condition (V=0 at `r=R`) is satisfied if we place an image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. The values for `q'` and `b` are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge location:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of `q` and the grounded sphere is now electrostatically equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a system of two point charges: `q` at distance `d` from the origin and `q'` at distance `b` from the origin.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the electric field of the induced charges on the sphere. Using the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\nHowever, we must be careful. The magnitude and position of the image charge depend on the position of the real charge `q`. Therefore, we cannot simply calculate the potential energy as `k*q*q'/(d-b)`. We must calculate the work by integrating the force over the path.\n\nA more direct method is to use the general formula for electrostatic energy in the presence of conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges in the system.\n\nIn our case, the system consists of the point charge `q` and the charge distribution on the grounded sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [ q * V_sphere_at_q + ∫ V_on_sphere * σ dS ]`\n\n1.  Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_on_sphere` is 0. Therefore, the second term of the equation is zero.\n    `∫ V_on_sphere * σ dS = ∫ 0 * σ dS = 0`\n\n2.  The term `V_sphere_at_q` represents the potential at the location of the charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n    *   The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The location of `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential at `q` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n3.  Now, substitute the values of `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_sphere_at_q = - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  Finally, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere_at_q`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result represents the net potential energy of the system. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the sphere is attractive, and energy is released as the charge is brought closer from infinity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived result with the given options:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The presence of the charge `q` induces a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. The net force between the charge `q` and the sphere is attractive. We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced charges on its surface, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at `r=R`) becomes zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (d'):**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `d'` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Position of the image charge: `d' = R^2 / d`\n    *   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n    The image charge is located along the same line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. The negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite polarity to `q`, which is consistent with an attractive force.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The work is done against the electrostatic force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n    The force `F(x)` on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is equal to the force between `q` and its image `q'(x)`.\n    *   At position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at position `x' = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `x - x' = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force on `q` is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - x')^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    *   The external force required to move the charge is `F_ext = -F(x)`.\n    *   The work done (potential energy) is `U = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_ext(x) dx`.\n    *   `U = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    *   To solve the integral, use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    *   `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫(from ∞ to d^2-R^2) u^-2 du`\n    *   `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]` evaluated from `∞` to `d^2-R^2`.\n    *   `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞)]`\n    *   `U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n    **Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n    The total energy of a system of conductors and charges is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n    *   In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere.

Understanding the Physical System and Method\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed near a grounded conducting sphere. A grounded conductor is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. To find the potential and forces, the most effective method is the **method of images**.\n\n### 2. Applying the Method of Images\nThe method of images states that the electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of V=0 at all points on the surface of the sphere (where r=R).\n\nThe standard results for this configuration are:\n*   **Image charge magnitude (q'):** The image charge is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`. Its magnitude is given by:\n    `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n*   **Image charge position (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center of the sphere is:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of the original charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: `q` at distance `d` and `q'` at distance `b` from the origin.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which, by the method of images, is simply the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n\n1.  The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere is the Coulomb force between `q` and its image `q'`.\n    *   Force `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n    *   At position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The force is attractive (negative sign).\n\n2.  The potential energy `U` is the work done against this force, which is the negative of the work done by the field.\n    `U = - W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n3.  To solve the integral, we use substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫ (1/2) * (1/u^2) du`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u]` evaluated from `x=∞` to `x=d`.\n    The limits for `u` are `∞` and `d^2 - R^2`.\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential `U = (1/2)qV`**\n\n1.  The energy of a system of conductors and charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\n2.  In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, so its potential `V_sphere = 0`. Thus, its contribution to the energy sum is zero.\n\n3.  The total energy is therefore just the energy of the point charge `q` in the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the potential `V_induced` is created by the charge `q` itself. We must not double-count the interaction energy.\n\n4.  The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere (`V_induced`) is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  Now, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4.

Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center along an axis (let's say the x-axis), so its position is `x=d`.\nThe image charge, let's call it `q'`, is placed at a position `b` along the same axis. We need to find the values of `q'` and `b` such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\nThe potential `V` at any point on the surface of the sphere is the sum of the potentials from the charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\nLet a point P on the surface of the sphere be at a distance `r_1` from `q` and `r_2` from `q'`.\nThe potential at P is `V(P) = k*q/r_1 + k*q'/r_2 = 0`.\n\nThrough geometric analysis, it can be shown that this condition is satisfied for all points on the sphere if the image charge `q'` has a magnitude and position given by:\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere (since `d > R`, it follows that `b < R`), and it has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. The force on the charge `q` at any position `x` (where `x>R`) is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on `q`.\n\nAn alternative, and simpler, method is to calculate the interaction energy of the system. The potential energy `U` of a configuration of charges is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nOur system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced surface charge `σ` on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [ q * V_induced_at_q + ∫(σ * V_sphere) dS ]`\n\n*   `V_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. Thus, the integral term is zero.\n*   `V_induced_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThe potential `V_induced_at_q` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n1.  **Calculate the potential at `d` due to the image charge `q'`.**\n    *   The image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n    *   The charge `q` is at `d`.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   The potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_induced_at_q = k * q' / (distance)`\n        `V_induced_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_induced_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the total potential energy `U`.**\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced_at_q`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis expression represents the net potential energy of the system. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\nC) `U = - kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived formula matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Setup:** We have a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`. The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the conductor. We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is a classic application of the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, which are created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be exactly replicated by a simpler system. This equivalent system consists of the original charge `q` and a single \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The properties of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface `r=R` is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   Magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Location: at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is equal to the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the attractive force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The force on charge `q` (at a variable distance `x` from the center) due to the image charge `q'` (at `b=R^2/x`) is:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance)^2`\n        The distance between `q` at `x` and `q'` at `b` is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n        The image charge magnitude is `q' = -qR/x`.\n        `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n        The potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge from `∞` to `d`:\n        `U = W = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx = - ∫[∞, d] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n        `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n        The integral of `x / (x^2 - R^2)^2` is `-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`.\n        Evaluating the integral:\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` from `∞` to `d`.\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞)))]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Potential of the Image Charge**\n        A more direct method is to use the formula for interaction energy: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. Here, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` that is created by all other charges (i.e., the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge is itself dependent on `q`.\n        The potential `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n        Now, substitute this into the energy formula:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect.\n    B) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect.\n    C) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect.\n    D) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - This matches our result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical System and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere means its electric potential is held at zero.\n\nThis problem is solved using the **method of images**. We can replace the conducting sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero everywhere on the surface where the sphere was.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. Since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), it follows that `b < R`, so the image charge is located inside the sphere, as required.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted on `q` by the induced charges on the sphere. According to the method of images, this force is exactly the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n#### Method 1: Integrating the Force\n\n1.  Let the charge `q` be at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center of the sphere as it is brought in from infinity.\n2.  At this position `x`, the image charge is `q' = -qR/x` and its position is `b = R^2/x`.\n3.  The distance between the charge `q` (at `x`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n4.  The force exerted by the image charge on the real charge `q` is attractive:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * (x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2)`\n    `F(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n5.  The potential energy `U(d)` is the work done by the field to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is `U(d) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`. It's often easier to calculate it as `U(d) = ∫(from d to ∞) F(x) dx`.\n    `U(d) = ∫(from d to ∞) [- k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * ∫(from d to ∞) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n6.  To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n    `∫ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))`\n7.  Now, we apply the limits of integration:\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2)) ]` from `d` to `∞`\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * [ (lim x->∞ -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))) ]`\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * [ 0 + 1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    `U(d) = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n#### Method 2: Using the Potential of the Image Charge\n\nA more direct method recognizes that the interaction energy `U` of a charge `q` with an induced charge distribution on a conductor is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge distribution is created by `q` itself.\n\n1.  `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere.\n2.  This potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n3.  The distance between the location of `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n4.  The potential is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n5.  Now, we calculate the potential energy:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system:\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and the Method of Images\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has a potential of zero (V=0).\n\nTo solve this, we use the **method of images**. This method allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the sphere with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere (at a distance `R` from the center), matching the boundary condition of the grounded sphere.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Location (b)\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the origin. The image charge `q'` is placed at a distance `b` from the origin, along the same line as `q`.\n\nFor the potential on the surface of the sphere to be zero, the potential from `q` and `q'` must cancel out everywhere on the surface. The standard derivation for this setup yields the following for the image charge and its location:\n\n*   **Location of image charge (b):**\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n*   **Magnitude of image charge (q'):**\n    `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe image charge has the opposite sign to the real charge and is located inside the sphere (since `d > R`, it follows that `b < R`).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. An elegant way to calculate this energy is using the formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all other charges in the system. In our case, \"all other charges\" refers to the induced charge on the surface of the sphere.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential created by the induced surface charge is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. So, we need to find the potential created by `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n*   **The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.**\n*   **The location of the image charge `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.**\n*   **The distance between `q` and `q'` is:**\n    `distance = d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nNow, we can calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and the distance:\n\n`V_induced = k * [-q * (R / d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nFinally, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis is the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 5.

The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is most easily solved using the \"method of images.\" The basic idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, equivalent \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `d'` inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r = R`) is zero.\n\nThe established results from the method of images for this scenario are:\n\n*   **Image Charge (q'):** The magnitude and sign of the image charge are given by:\n    `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    The image charge has the opposite sign to the original charge.\n\n*   **Image Position (d'):** The image charge is located along the same line as the original charge `q` and the center of the sphere, at a distance `d'` from the center:\n    `d' = R^2 / d`\n    Since `d > R`, `d'` will be less than `R`, so the image charge is correctly located inside the sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of this configuration.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force (Work Done)**\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is equal to the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n\n`U = -W_field = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) ⋅ dx`\n\nWhere `F(x)` is the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center.

The external force is the negative of the electric force `F_elec` exerted by the induced charges on `q`.\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_ext ⋅ dx = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_elec ⋅ dx`\n\nThe electric force on `q` when it is at a variable distance `x` from the center is the same as the force exerted by its corresponding image charge `q_image(x) = -qR/x` at `b(x) = R²/x`.\nThe distance between the charge at `x` and its image is `x - b(x) = x - R²/x`.\n\nThe force is:\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * q_image / (distance)² = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F_elec(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done (potential energy):\n`U = -∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n`U = k * q² * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, let `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n`U = k * q² * R * (1/2) ∫(from x=∞ to x=d) u⁻² du`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [-1/u] (from x=∞ to x=d)`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [-1/(x² - R²)] (from ∞ to d)`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [(-1/(d² - R²)) - (-1/∞)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Interaction Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the result that for a charge `q` brought near a conductor, the total potential energy `U` is half the interaction energy of the final charge with the final induced potential.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the final position of `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. This potential is identical to the potential created by the final image charge `q' = -qR/d` at position `b = R²/d`.\n\nThe distance between the final charge `q` and its image `q'` is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\nThe potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### 4.

The Method of Images\n\nThe electric field and potential outside a grounded conducting sphere due to an external charge `q` are identical to the field and potential that would be produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere, with the sphere itself removed.\n\nThe conditions for the image charge are that the potential on the surface of the original sphere (at radius R) must be zero.\n\n*   **Original charge:** `q` at a distance `d` from the center.\n*   **Image charge:** Let the image charge be `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as `q`.\n\nTo satisfy the condition V=0 on the surface of the sphere, the magnitude and position of the image charge must be:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is now electrically equivalent to a system of two point charges: `q` and `q'`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force acting on the charge `q` during this process is the attractive force from the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\n1.  The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by its image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` which is at a distance `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n2.  The distance between the charge `q` and its image `q'` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n3.  The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`. The negative sign indicates an attractive force.\n4.  The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field: `U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`.\n5.  `U = - ∫[∞, d] (- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = k * q^2 * R * ∫[∞, d] (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n6.  Using the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`, the integral becomes `∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = -1/(2u) = -1/(2(x^2 - R^2))`.\n7.  Evaluating the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1/(2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1/(2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method B: Using Potential (with a factor of 1/2)**\n\nThe potential energy of interaction between a point charge and a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n\n1.  The potential at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) due to the induced charges is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that point.\n2.  `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n3.  `q' = -qR/d`\n4.  Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n5.  `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n6.  Now, calculate the potential energy:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*Note: The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the source of the potential (the induced charge) is created by the field of the charge `q` itself. If we simply used `U = qV`, we would be double-counting the energy.*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\nB) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\nC) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\nD) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V=0).\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the interaction between the charge `q` and the sphere, can be calculated using the **method of images**. This method replaces the complex charge distribution induced on the sphere's surface with a single, imaginary point charge (an \"image charge\") placed inside the sphere.\n\nThe value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) becomes zero, satisfying the boundary condition for a grounded sphere.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin (0,0,0) and the real charge `q` be on the z-axis at `z = d`.\n\nThe image charge, let's call it `q'`, must also lie on the z-axis at some position `z = b` inside the sphere (`b < R`) for symmetry.\n\nThe standard results from the method of images (derived by setting the potential V=0 at the sphere's surface) are:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge (`b`):**\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge (`q'`):**\n    `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the system of the real charge `q` and the grounded sphere is electrostatically equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a system of two point charges: the real charge `q` at `z = d` and the image charge `q'` at `z = b`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it induces charges on the sphere. The work is done against the force exerted by these induced charges.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system can be calculated as:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of `1/2` is crucial because the induced charge distribution is not fixed; it is created by the presence of `q` itself. The energy is stored in the interaction between `q` and the charges it has induced.\n\nUsing the method of images, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q` (`z = d`).\n\n1.  **Calculate the distance between the real charge and the image charge:**\n    Distance = `d - b`\n    Distance = `d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential `V_induced` at `z=d` due to `q'`:**\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-q * R/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the total potential energy `U`:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated potential energy is `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nLet's compare this with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   B) `U = -kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   C) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n*   D) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur result perfectly matches option A. The energy is negative because the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System and the Method of Images\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has an electric potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` induces a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition. The electric field outside the sphere is complex due to this induced charge distribution.\n\nThe \"method of images\" is a powerful technique to solve such problems. It simplifies the problem by replacing the sphere and its induced charges with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere's original volume. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is V=0 on the spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at `z = d`. We place the image charge `q'` at `z = b` along the same axis.\n\nThe potential `V` at any point on the surface of the sphere (a point at radius `R`) must be zero. The potential is the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'`.\n`V(surface) = k*q/r₁ + k*q'/r₂ = 0`\nwhere `r₁` is the distance from `q` to the point on the surface and `r₂` is the distance from `q'` to the point on the surface.\n\nBy solving this equation for all points on the sphere, we find the unique values for the image charge `q'` and its position `b`:\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R² / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the complex system of `q` and the grounded sphere is equivalent, for all points outside the sphere, to a simpler system of two point charges: `q` at `z=d` and `q' = -qR/d` at `z=R²/d`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy (U)\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. As we bring `q` in, it induces charges on the sphere, and there's a force between `q` and these induced charges.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\n\nThe force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the image charge `q' = -qR/x` at `b = R²/x`.\nThe distance between the charge and its image is `x - b = x - R²/x`.\nThe force is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)² = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work done by this electric force as the charge moves from infinity to `d`:\n`U = -W = - ∫[infinity to d] F(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫[infinity to d] (-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²) dx = k * q² * R * ∫[infinity to d] (x / (x² - R²)²) dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use u-substitution with `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`∫ (x / (x² - R²)²) dx = ∫ (1/u²) (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral:\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ]` from infinity to `d`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - R²))) ]`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(d² - R²)) - 0 ]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n#### Method B: Using Potential `U = (1/2)qV`\n\nThe total electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ qᵢVᵢ`, where `Vᵢ` is the potential at the location of charge `qᵢ` due to all *other* charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced + (1/2) * ∫ V_sphere * d(q_induced)`\nSince the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0, so the second term is zero.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\nThe potential from the image charge `q'` at the location of `q` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\nDistance = `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n`q' = -qR/d`\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d) = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d² - R²) ]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system.

A common and reliable formula for the interaction energy of a charge with a system of conductors is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges in the system. In this case, `V_induced` is the potential created by the induced charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\nAccording to the method of images, this potential `V_induced` is exactly the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the position of the original charge `q`.\n\n**4. Calculating V_induced**\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at distance `d` from the center is the potential due to the image charge `q'` located at distance `b` from the center. The distance between the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n\n*   `V_induced = k * (- (R/d) * q) / (d - R^2 / d)`\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n\n*   `d - R^2 / d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n\n*   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n*   `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Potential Energy (U)**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n*   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis is the net potential energy of the system. The energy is negative, which signifies that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n**6. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) U = - kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)\nB) U = - (1/2) kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)\nC) U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)\nD) U = - (1/2) * k*q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)\n\nOur derived expression `U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2-R^2)` matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the \"method of images.\" To satisfy the boundary condition that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere, we can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `d'` inside the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` are given by:\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the same line as the original charge `q`)\n\nThe negative sign of `q'` indicates that the force between the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is attractive.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n#### Method 1: Integrating the Force\n\nThe work `U` is the integral of the external force required to move the charge, which is the negative of the electric force `F(x)` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n\nAs we bring the charge `q` from a position `x` to `d`, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` also change depending on `x`. At any given position `x`, the force on charge `q` due to the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `d'(x)`.\n\n*   `q'(x) = -q * R/x`\n*   `d'(x) = R^2 / x`\n\nThe distance between the charge `q` at `x` and its image `q'(x)` at `d'(x)` is `x - d'(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on `q` is given by Coulomb's law:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - d'(x))^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done (potential energy):\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`, and `x dx = du/2`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ] (from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\nThe term with `∞` in the denominator goes to zero.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method 2: Using Potential (Shortcut)\n\nThe potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of conductors is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductors. The factor of `1/2` is crucial and arises because the induced charges are not fixed but are themselves established by `q`.\n\n1.  **Find the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge `q'`.**\n    The real charge `q` is at distance `d`. The image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at distance `d' = R^2/d`.\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `Δx = d - d' = d - R^2/d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential `V_induced`:**\n    The potential at position `d` due to the image charge is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / Δx = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / d * (1 / ((d^2 - R^2)/d))`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the potential energy `U`:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images.

Understand the Problem and the Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero (V = 0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. To solve this problem, we use the \"method of images\". This method replaces the complex charge distribution on the sphere with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The position and magnitude of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero, matching the condition of the grounded sphere.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nThrough standard derivation, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center of the sphere are found to be:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   The charge is opposite in sign to `q`, which makes sense as it creates an attractive force.\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   The image charge is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the charge `q`. Since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), it follows that `b < R`, so the image charge is correctly located inside the sphere.\n\nNow, the system of the real charge `q` and the grounded sphere is electrostatically equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a system of two point charges: the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n**3.

The work done is the integral of the force from infinity to `d`.\n`U = W = ∫_∞^d F(x) dx`\nwhere `x` is the variable distance from the center.\nThe force at any distance `x` is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\nIntegrating this gives the potential energy:\n`U = ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = [ (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (x^2 - R^2) ]_∞^d`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2) - 0 = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nWait, the force is attractive, so the potential energy should be negative.

The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`). The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The goal is to calculate the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n\n2.  **Choose a Method of Solution:**\n    This is a classic electrostatics problem that is most easily solved using the **method of images**. This method allows us to replace the complex problem of a charge and a conductor (with an unknown induced surface charge distribution) with a simpler problem of two point charges.\n\n3.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    *   The electric field *outside* the grounded conducting sphere can be exactly replicated by removing the sphere and placing an \"image charge,\" `q'`, at a specific location inside the sphere's original volume.\n    *   The condition is that the potential created by the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must be zero on the surface where the sphere was (i.e., at a radius `R`).\n    *   Through a standard derivation (or by recalling the result), the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` (distance from the center) are found to be:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n        *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d` (located on the line connecting the center and `q`).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it induces charge on the sphere, which in turn exerts a force on `q`. The potential energy is the work done against this force.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n    *   The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at its position `d'(x)`.\n    *   At a position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = - (R/x) * q` and its position is `d'(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'` (at `R^2/x`) is `x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force on `q` is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    *   The potential energy `U` is the work done *by an external agent* to bring the charge from infinity to `d`.

The potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and energy is released as the charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated expression `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThis problem requires the application of the method of images to find the potential energy of the system.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at a constant value of zero (`V_sphere = 0`).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere is complex due to the induced charges on its surface. The method of images simplifies this by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The position and magnitude of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface where the sphere used to be is zero, satisfying the boundary condition.\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge and Position:** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center, on the same line as `q`) are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculate Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere. The method of images tells us that this force is exactly the same as the force exerted by the fictitious image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Force:** Let's calculate the force `F(x)` on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center (`x > R`).\n    *   The image charge at this point would be `q'(x) = -q * (R/x)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge would be `b(x) = R^2 / x`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `x`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b(x)`) is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force between them (which is the force on `q` from the sphere) is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n        `F(x) = k * q * [-q(R/x)] / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n        `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R) / x / [(x^2 - R^2)/x]^2`\n        `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R) / x * [x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2]`\n        `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive (towards the sphere).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Work Done (Potential Energy):** The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to assemble it. We can calculate this by integrating the force required to move the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. The change in potential energy is the negative of the work done by the conservative electric field.\n    `U(d) - U(∞) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    Assuming `U(∞) = 0`, we get:\n    `U(d) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n7.  **Solve the Integral:** We use a substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du / 2`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    `∫ [1 / u^2] * (du / 2) = (1/2) * ∫ u^(-2) du = (1/2) * (-1 * u^(-1)) = -1 / (2u)`\n    Substituting back `u = x^2 - R^2`, the integral is `-1 / [2(x^2 - R^2)]`.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:**\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * { [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - [-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))] }`\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * { [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - 0 }`\n    `U(d) = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\n9.  **Final Result:**\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n10. **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   B) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   C) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur derived result matches option D perfectly.\n\n### Alternative reasoning for the 1/2 factor\nThe interaction energy can also be found by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the position of `q` due to the induced charge on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (and its potential) is created by and is proportional to `q` itself.\n*   `V_induced` at `d` is the potential from the image charge `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * [-q(R/d)] / (d - R^2/d) = -k*q*R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k*q*R / (d^2 - R^2)] = -(1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nThis confirms the result again.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Setup**\n\nWe have a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. This means its electrical potential is fixed at zero (`V=0`). A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`.\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will polarize the sphere, inducing surface charges on it. These induced charges will create their own electric field. The net potential energy of the system is the energy stored in the total electric field, which is equivalent to the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at `d`.\n\n### **2. Apply the Method of Images**\n\nThis problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images\". The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nLet's find the magnitude (`q'`) and position (`b` from the center) of this image charge. The key condition is that the sum of the potentials from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must be zero everywhere on the surface of the sphere (since it's grounded).\n\nLet's place the center of the sphere at the origin and the charge `q` on the x-axis at `x=d`. The image charge `q'` will also be on the x-axis at `x=b`.\n\nThe potential at any point `P` on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) must be zero.\nPotential due to `q`: `V_q = kq / r_1`\nPotential due to `q'`: `V_{q'} = kq' / r_2`\n\nwhere `r_1` is the distance from `q` to `P` and `r_2` is the distance from `q'` to `P`.\n\nBy solving the equation `V_q + V_{q'} = 0` for all points on the surface, we find the following for the image charge:\n\n*   **Position of image charge (`b`):** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge (`q'`):** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the complex system of the point charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to a simpler system of two point charges: the original charge `q` at `d` and an image charge `q' = -q(R/d)` at `b = R^2/d`. This equivalence is valid for calculating the field and potential *outside* the sphere.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the sphere's center. This work is done against the force exerted by the sphere (i.e., by the induced charges). This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nA more direct way to calculate the potential energy (`U`) of the interaction is using the formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` that is created by all *other* charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charges are not fixed; their distribution changes as `q` is brought in from infinity.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at distance `d` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\n1.  **Calculate the distance between `q` and `q'`:**\n    The distance is `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential `V_induced` at `d`:**\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the total potential energy `U`:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### **4. Final Answer Check**\n\nThe derived expression for the potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nLet's compare this with the given options:\n\nA) `U = - kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n\nOur result perfectly matches option B. The negative sign is physically correct, indicating that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the system's energy is lower than when the charge is at infinity (U=0).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded conducting sphere is an equipotential surface with a potential of `V=0`.\n\nThis electrostatic problem can be simplified using the **method of images**. We can replace the conducting sphere and its induced surface charge with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`) is zero.\n\nThe standard results for the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to `q`) are:\n*   **Image charge value:** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe electric field and potential *outside* the sphere (`r > R`) are now correctly described by the superposition of the fields from the original point charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the potential is zero) to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere, while the sphere is held at `V=0`.\n\n`U = W_ext = ∫_∞^d F_ext ⋅ dr`\n\nWhere `F_ext` is the external force required to move the charge, which is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force `F_e` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n\n`F_ext = - F_e`\n\nThe force `F_e` exerted by the induced charges on the sphere on the charge `q` is, by the method of images, equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on `q`.\n\nLet's calculate this force when the charge `q` is at a generic distance `x` from the center (`x > R`):\n*   Force on `q` due to `q'`: `F_e(x)`\n*   Position of `q`: `x`\n*   Position of `q'(x)`: `b(x) = R^2/x`\n*   Value of `q'(x)`: `q'(x) = - (R/x) * q`\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`\n\nThe force is attractive (towards the sphere):\n`F_e(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n`F_e(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F_e(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F_e(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * (x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2)`\n`F_e(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done (potential energy `U`):\n`U = ∫_∞^d F_ext dx = ∫_∞^d -F_e(x) dx`\n`U = ∫_∞^d [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve this integral, we use a substitution:\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du/2`.\n\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫ u^-2 du`\n\nThe integral of `u^-2` is `-u^-1 = -1/u`.\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]` (evaluated at the bounds corresponding to `x`)\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1 / (x^2 - R^2)] |_∞^d`\n\nNow, apply the limits:\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ (-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - (-1 / (∞^2 - R^2)) ]`\nThe term with infinity goes to zero.\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1 / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3. Alternative Method (Using Potential)\n\nThe interaction energy of a charge distribution is `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`. For our system of a point charge `q` and a conducting body (the sphere), the energy is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_q + (1/2) ∫_sphere σV_sphere dA`\n\n*   `V_sphere = 0` (grounded sphere), so the second term is zero.\n*   `V_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to *all other charges* (i.e., the induced charges on the sphere). This self-energy of `q` is not included.\n*   This potential from the induced charges is, by the method of images, the same as the potential from the image charge `q'`.\n\nSo, `V_q = V_induced = V_from_q'`.\nThe distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b=R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option C.\n\nLet's quickly check the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect, has `R^2`.\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect, missing `1/2` and has `d` instead of `R`.\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct.**\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect denominator and numerator.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a charge reservoir (the Earth) and is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` induces an opposite charge distribution on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition on the sphere's surface.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This problem is a classic application of the method of images in electrostatics. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be accurately described by removing the sphere and replacing it with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `d'` inside the sphere.

The goal is to choose `q'` and its position `d'` such that the potential on the spherical surface of radius `R` is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` (measured from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n    The image charge lies on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the external charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. A general formula for the electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is:\n    `U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\n    where `q_i` are the charges and `V_i` is the potential at the location of `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n5.  **Apply the Energy Formula to Our System:**\n    *   Our system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the grounded sphere.\n    *   The potential of the sphere is `V_sphere = 0` (it is grounded).\n    *   The potential at the location of the point charge `q`, due to the induced charge on the sphere, is `V_induced`.\n    *   The formula becomes: `U = (1/2) * (q * V_induced + q_induced_total * V_sphere)`\n    *   Since `V_sphere = 0`, the second term vanishes: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n6.  **Calculate `V_induced`:**\n    *   The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The image charge `q'` is at a distance `d' = R^2/d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `r = d - d' = d - R^2/d`.\n    *   The potential created by `q'` at the location of `q` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / r`\n        where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1/(4πε₀)`).\n\n7.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `r`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - R^2/d]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`:**\n    *   Now substitute this `V_induced` back into our energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The derived expression `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option B exactly.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, so the potential energy decreases as the charge is brought closer from infinity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Choosing the Right Method\n\nThe problem asks for the potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere has its electric potential maintained at zero (V=0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charge on the surface of the conducting sphere. The total potential energy is the work done to assemble this configuration. Specifically, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to a distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nThe most effective way to solve this electrostatic problem is the **method of images**. This method simplifies the problem by replacing the conducting sphere and its complex induced surface charge with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet:\n*   `R` be the radius of the sphere.\n*   The center of the sphere be the origin (0, 0, 0).\n*   The real charge `q` be placed on the z-axis at a distance `d` from the center (i.e., at `z = d`).\n*   The image charge, `q'`, be placed at a distance `b` from the center along the same axis (at `z = b`), where `b < R`.\n\nThe potential at any point on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) must be zero. The total potential is the sum of the potential from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n`V(surface) = V_q + V_{q'} = 0`\n`k * q / (distance from q) + k * q' / (distance from q') = 0`\n\nBy solving this equation for all points on the surface, we can find the unique values for `q'` and `b`. The standard result from the method of images for a grounded sphere is:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the complex system of the charge `q` and the grounded sphere can be replaced by a much simpler system of two point charges: `q` at `z=d` and `q'` at `z=b`, for calculating the field and potential *outside* the sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`. This work is done against the force exerted on `q` by the induced charges on the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the charge `q` in the potential created by the induced charge (`V_induced`) is given by:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nA factor of 1/2 is essential here. The potential `V_induced` is not a fixed external potential; it is created by the presence of `q` itself. As `q` is brought from infinity, the induced charge on the sphere builds up from zero. The work done is `W = ∫ F⋅dl`. The force `F` on `q` due to the induced charge is proportional to `q`. The induced charge itself is also proportional to `q`. Therefore, the force is proportional to `q^2`, and the potential energy, which is the integral of this force, is also proportional to `q^2`. A detailed derivation shows the work done is `(1/2)QV`, not just `QV`.\n\nNow, we calculate `V_induced` at the location of charge `q`. In the method of images, this is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the position `d`.\n\n*   The image charge `q'` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n*   The real charge `q` is at `d`.\n*   The distance between them is `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced = V_{q'} = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the potential expression:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this potential back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Comparing with Options\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect.\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **This matches our result.**\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n\nThe correct expression for the net potential energy of the system is given by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical System and Method\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed near a grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere has its potential fixed at zero (V=0). The charge `q` induces an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere. Calculating the potential energy directly from this induced charge distribution is difficult.\n\nThe standard and most elegant way to solve this problem is using the **method of images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the boundary condition (V=0 on the sphere's surface) is satisfied. For an observer outside the sphere, the electric field and potential due to the sphere's induced charges are identical to the field and potential created by the image charge.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)\nLet the center of the sphere of radius `R` be at the origin. The point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center (let's say on the z-axis, at z=d).\n\nThe image charge `q'` is placed at a distance `b` from the center along the same axis. For the potential on the surface of the sphere (where the distance from the origin is `r=R`) to be zero, the position and magnitude of the image charge must be:\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThis is a standard result from electrostatics. With the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'`, the potential at `r=R` is zero, satisfying the condition for a grounded sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is stored as potential energy in the electric field.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\nThe force on the real charge `q` is due to the electric field of the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nLet's calculate the force on `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center (`x > R`). At this point, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at a position `b(x) = R^2/x`. The force is the Coulomb force between `q` and `q'(x)`:\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n*   Force `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R*x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\nThe negative sign indicates the force is attractive.\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external force to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is the negative of the work done by the electrostatic field:\n`U = W_ext = - integral(∞ to d) [F(x) dx]`\n`U = - integral(∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R*x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * integral(∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\nThe integral becomes `integral(1/(2u^2) du) = -1/(2u) = -1/(2(x^2 - R^2))`.\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1/(2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1/(2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula\nThe potential energy `U` of a system of charges and conductors can be expressed as `U = (1/2) * Σ(q_i * V_i)`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nIn our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere (whose potential `V_sphere` is 0).\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced + (1/2) * Q_induced * V_sphere`\nSince `V_sphere = 0`, the second term vanishes.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n`V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charge on the sphere. By the method of images, this is equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n*   `q' = -qR/d`\n*   Distance from image charge (at `b = R^2/d`) to the point `d` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system.\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U = - k*q^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U = - (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition on its surface. We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This problem can be simplified using the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced charges on its surface, can be exactly replicated by a single fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere. The potential on the surface of the sphere due to the external charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must be zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at `x=d`. The image charge `q'` is placed at a position `b` from the center along the line connecting the center and `q`. Through calculations that enforce the V=0 condition on the sphere's surface, the parameters of the image charge are found to be:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n    The image charge is located inside the sphere (since d > R, then b < R) and has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external force to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The external force required is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force exerted on `q` by the grounded sphere. By the method of images, this electrostatic force is the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    Let's calculate this work by integrating the force:\n    *   The potential energy `U` is given by the integral of the external force `F_ext` from infinity to `d`. `U = ∫[∞, d] F_ext dx`.\n    *   The external force is opposite to the electrostatic force between `q` and the sphere: `F_ext = -F_elec`.\n    *   The electrostatic force on charge `q` when it is at a variable distance `x` from the center is the force from its corresponding image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n        *   `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n        *   `b(x) = R^2/x`\n        *   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force is `F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`.\n        `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n        This is an attractive force (negative sign).\n    *   The external force is `F_ext(x) = -F_elec(x) = k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    *   Now, we integrate to find the potential energy `U`:\n        `U = ∫[∞, d] F_ext(x) dx = ∫[∞, d] [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    *   To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`.\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * ∫[∞, d^2-R^2] (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * ∫ u^-2 du`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-u^-1]_∞^(d^2-R^2)`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]_∞^(d^2-R^2)`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞) ]`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) ]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Alternative (Shortcut) Method:**\n    The interaction energy of the system can also be found using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges (or, equivalently, by the image charge).\n    *   `V_induced` at distance `d` is the potential from `q'` at distance `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / d / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Now, calculate the energy:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods yield the same result.

Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0 everywhere on its surface. Therefore, the second term `(1/2) ∫ (0) σ dA = 0`.\n\n    *   This leaves us with `U = (1/2) q V_at_q`. Here, `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all *other* charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    *   According to the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the potential created by the single image charge `q'`.\n\n    *   So, we need to calculate the potential at position `d` (where `q` is located) due to the image charge `q'` at position `b`. The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n        `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_at_q = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_at_q`:\n        `V_at_q = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\n    *   Cancel the `d` from the numerator's and denominator's fractions:\n        `V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   Finally, substitute this potential back into the formula for the total energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) q V_at_q`\n        `U = (1/2) q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and thus the potential energy is lower than the zero-energy state at infinite separation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q`.\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.

Problem Setup and Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). A grounded sphere has an electric potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is the superposition of the field from the point charge `q` and the field from the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThe \"method of images\" provides a powerful way to solve this problem. We can replace the sphere and its induced charges with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The electric field outside the original sphere's volume will be identical to the field produced by the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\nFor a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` must be placed such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude (q'):** The image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. Its magnitude is:\n    `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n*   **Image charge position (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center of the sphere is:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n### **2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position `d`, while the sphere remains grounded.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method 1: Integration of Force**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work `W_field` done by the electric field of the induced charge as `q` is brought from infinity.\n`U = -W_field = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_induced ⋅ dr`\n\nThe force on the charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. As the position of `q` changes (let's call its variable position `x`), the magnitude and position of its image also change (`q'(x) = -qR/x`, `b(x) = R²/x`).\n\nThe attractive force on charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nThe potential energy `U` is:\n`U = -W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n`U = k * q² * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n`∫ [x / (x² - R²)²] dx = ∫ [1/u²] (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral:\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ](from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - R²))) ]`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(d² - R²)) - 0 ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Interaction Energy of the Image System**\n\nA well-known result from electrostatics states that the potential energy of a point charge `q` in the presence of a grounded conductor is equal to half the interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'`.\n\n`U = (1/2) * U_interaction = (1/2) * (k * q * q' / r)`\n\nwhere `r` is the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n*   `r = d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n*   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nNow, substitute these into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * k * q * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\nThe `d` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out.\n`U = (1/2) * k * q * [-qR] / [d² - R²]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system:\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThis expression is negative, which is expected because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere (as the induced charge is of the opposite sign overall).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) `U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   B) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   C) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   D) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\n\nOur derived formula `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)` exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System and the Problem:**\n    The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has a constant potential of zero (V=0).\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    To solve this electrostatics problem, we use the method of images. This technique allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conducting sphere with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are the same in both the original problem and the simplified image-charge problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` must be placed such that the potential at the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero. The established results for this configuration are:\n    *   The position of the image charge, `b`, from the center along the line connecting the center and `q`, is `b = R^2 / d`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. As the charge `q` is brought in, the sphere remains grounded, and an induced charge builds up on its surface. The force on `q` is due to this induced charge.\n\n    Using the method of images, the force on `q` is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. However, it's crucial to realize that as `q` moves from infinity to `d`, the image charge `q'` also changes its magnitude and position. Therefore, we must integrate the force over the path.\n\n    Let's consider an intermediate position `x` for the charge `q` (`x > R`). At this point:\n    *   The image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x`.\n    *   Its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\n    The force on charge `q` at position `x` is the attractive Coulomb force from the image charge:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2) = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field:\n    `U = - W_field = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫[from ∞ to d] [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R) ∫[from ∞ to d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`. The limits of integration become:\n    *   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n    *   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R) ∫[from ∞ to d^2-R^2] (1/u^2) (du/2)`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u] |_[from ∞ to d^2-R^2]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞) ]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * (k * q^2 * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`.

We can replace the sphere and its induced charges with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    The image charge lies on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common misconception is to simply calculate the potential energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct way is to consider that the induced charge (and thus the image charge) changes as `q` is brought closer.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the interaction between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere can be found by calculating half the potential energy of `q` in the field of its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge on the sphere is created by the field of `q` itself; the system's energy is built up gradually.\n\n    *   The potential at the location of charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is `V_image`.\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential `V_image` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   The potential energy `U` of the system is half the product of the charge `q` and the potential at its location due to the other charges (which are represented by the image charge).\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R^2)\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)   (Correct)\n    C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)       (Incorrect, misses 1/2 and has 'd' in numerator)\n    D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)   (Incorrect, has 'd' in numerator and '+' in denominator)\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images in electrostatics.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** We need to find the total potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. The work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position is equal to the potential energy of the system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere due to the induced charges on its surface can be modeled by a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (since it's grounded).\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n    These values are chosen precisely so that the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'` is zero at any point on the spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    A crucial point in the method of images is that the potential energy of the *actual* system (charge `q` and the sphere) is **not** simply the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. This is because the image charge itself doesn't have its own energy; it's a mathematical construct representing the induced field.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the potential energy `U` is to find the potential `V'` created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`, and then the energy is `U = (1/2) * q * V'`. The factor of 1/2 is essential and arises because the induced charge (and thus the image charge) builds up as the real charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n5.  **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n    *   **Image charge:** `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   **Image position:** `b = R^2/d`\n    *   **Distance between real charge `q` and image charge `q'`:**\n        `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   **Potential `V'` at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'`:**\n        `V' = k * q' / (distance)`\n        `V' = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        By canceling `d` from the numerator and denominator, we get:\n        `V' = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   **Calculate the net potential energy `U` of the system:**\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V'`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated expression for the potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option D.\n\nThe energy is negative, which is physically correct because the charge `q` is attracted to the conducting sphere (as the induced charge on the closer surface is of the opposite sign), meaning the system is in a lower energy state than when the charge is infinitely far away (U=0).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images.

Understand the Setup**\nWe have a system consisting of:\n*   A point charge `q`.\n*   A grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. \"Grounded\" means its electric potential is held at zero (V=0).\n*   The distance from the center of the sphere to the point charge is `d`, where `d > R`.\n\n**2. The Method of Images**\nTo solve this problem, we use the method of images. This powerful technique allows us to replace the complex problem of a charge and a conductor with a simpler problem involving only point charges.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field *outside* the sphere is identical to the field produced by:\n*   The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n*   An \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. These properties are:\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the same line as the original charge).\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The force acting on the charge `q` is the attractive force from the induced charges on the sphere's surface. According to the method of images, this force is exactly the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\nThe work `W` done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity (`x = ∞`) to the distance `d` is equal to the potential energy `U`. This work is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n\n`U = W = - ∫[∞→d] F(x) ⋅ dx = ∫[d→∞] F(x) dx`\n\nHere, `F(x)` is the electrostatic force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center. This force is due to the image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` located at `b(x) = R²/x`.\n\n*   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R²/x`.\n*   The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))²`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n    `F(x) = -kq²R/x / ((x²-R²)/x)² = -kq²R/x * x²/(x²-R²)² = -kq²Rx / (x²-R²)²`\n\nNow, we integrate this force:\n`U = ∫[d→∞] (-kq²Rx / (x²-R²)²) dx`\n`U = -kq²R ∫[d→∞] (x / (x²-R²)²) dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x² - R²`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\nThe limits of integration change from `x=d` to `u = d²-R²` and `x→∞` to `u→∞`.\n\n`U = -kq²R ∫[d²-R²→∞] (1/u²) (du/2)`\n`U = -(kq²R/2) * [ -1/u ]_[d²-R²→∞]`\n`U = -(kq²R/2) * [ (lim u→∞ -1/u) - (-1/(d²-R²)) ]`\n`U = -(kq²R/2) * [ 0 + 1/(d²-R²) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * kq²R / (d²-R²)`\n\n**Method 2: Using Potential Energy Formula (with a subtlety)**\nThe potential energy of the interaction is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the final location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges (i.e., the induced charge on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge itself is created by the presence of `q`, so we must average over the charging process.\n\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at distance `d` from the center, caused by the image charge `q'` at position `b`.\n*   The distance between the final position of `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n*   `q' = -qR/d`.\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -kqR / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, calculate the energy:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -kqR / (d²-R²) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * kq²R / (d²-R²)`\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * kq²R / (d² - R²)`.

The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a potential of zero (V = 0). We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Method of Image Charges:** This problem is a classic application of the \"method of image charges.\" To satisfy the boundary condition that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere (`V(r=R) = 0`), we can replace the sphere with a fictitious \"image charge,\" `q'`, placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The electric field *outside* the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Location:**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n        *   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Note that since `d > R`, the position `b` is inside the sphere, and the image charge `q'` has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` against the electric force from the sphere.

A powerful technique for solving such problems is the method of images.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the conducting sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere's original volume. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (since it is grounded).\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n\n*   Located at a distance `d'` from the center, on the line connecting the center and `q`.\n    `d' = R^2 / d`\n*   Has a magnitude:\n    `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\nThe image charge `q'` has the opposite sign to `q`, which indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the sphere is attractive.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance (where potential energy is zero) to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center. We can calculate this using two common methods.\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\n\n1.  **Force on the charge q**: The force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere is equivalent to the electrostatic force exerted by the image charge `q'`. At this point, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at a position `d'(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between `q` and `q'` is `x - d'(x)`.\n    The force `F(x)` is:\n    `F(x) = k * (q * q') / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * (q * (-qR/x)) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * (R/x) / ((x^2-R^2)/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates the force is attractive (directed towards the sphere).\n\n2.  **Work and Potential Energy**: The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the field.\n    `U = W_agent = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫[∞, d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which means `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n    `∫ (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\n    Now, we evaluate the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method B: Using Potential `U = (1/2) qV`\n\n1.  **Energy Formula**: For a system of a point charge and a grounded conductor, the total potential energy is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is created by `q` itself.\n\n2.  **Induced Potential**: By the method of images, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q` (distance `d`).\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate Energy**: Now substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the potential energy of the system:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect `R^2`\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect numerator and missing factor of 1/2.\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct match.**\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect numerator and denominator.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of image charges.

An \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`) is zero, which is the condition for a grounded sphere. Through calculation, the image charge `q'` is found to be:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` from the center of the sphere. The sphere itself is grounded, so we only need to consider the work done on the charge `q`.\n\nThe force on the charge `q` at any position `x` (from the center) is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n\nAt an arbitrary distance `x` from the center, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between the real charge `q` and its image `q'` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on charge `q` is therefore:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)²`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = - (k * q² * R / x) / ((x² - R²)/x)²`\n`F(x) = - (k * q² * R / x) * (x² / (x² - R²)²)`\n`F(x) = - k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nThis force is attractive (negative sign), pulling `q` towards the sphere.\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from `x=∞` to `x=d` against this electric force.\n`U = W_ext = ∫[from ∞ to d] F_ext dx = ∫[from ∞ to d] -F(x) dx`\n`U = ∫[from ∞ to d] -[- k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n`U = k * q² * R ∫[from ∞ to d] x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use u-substitution. Let `u = x² - R²`, then `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\nThe integral becomes:\n`∫ (1/u²) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ]` evaluated from `x=∞` to `x=d`.\n`U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - R²))) ]`\nSince `1/∞ -> 0`, the second term vanishes.\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(d² - R²)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n### 3. Alternative (Simpler) Method\n\nA known result from the method of images is that the potential energy of interaction between a charge `q` and the induced charge on a grounded conductor is **one-half** of the potential energy between the charge `q` and its image charge `q'`.\n\n1.  Potential energy between `q` and `q'`:\n    `U_image = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n    The distance between them is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    `U_image = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n    `U_image = - k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n2.  The actual potential energy of the system is half of this value:\n    `U_system = (1/2) * U_image`\n    `U_system = (1/2) * [- k * q² * R / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U_system = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem can be solved using the **method of images**. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere are equivalent to the field and potential of the original charge `q` plus an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere.\n\n### 1. Determining the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet the center of the sphere be at the origin. The grounded conducting sphere has radius `R`, which means its surface potential is V = 0.\nThe real charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center (let's say on the z-axis, at z = d).\n\nFor the potential on the surface of the sphere to be zero, we need to place an image charge `q'` at a position `b` (also on the z-axis) inside the sphere. The values for `q'` and `b` that satisfy the V=0 boundary condition are:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\nThese values ensure that for any point on the sphere's surface (at radius R), the potential from `q` and `q'` sum to zero.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nA standard formula for the interaction energy `U` of a point charge `q` with a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\n1.  **Find the potential at position `d` due to the image charge `q'`:**\n    The image charge `q'` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n    The charge `q` is at `d`.\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `distance = d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n    The potential `V_induced` at position `d` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    By canceling out `d` from the numerator and the denominator, we get:\n    `V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the net potential energy `U`:**\n    Now, we use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The factor of 1/2 is present because the induced charge distribution is itself created by `q`, so the work is not simply `q * V_final` but an integral that results in the factor of 1/2.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) `U = - kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThis problem requires the use of the method of image charges to find the potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n*   We have a point charge `q`.\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V = 0`).\n*   The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`).\n\n**2. The Method of Image Charges**\nThe electric field and potential outside the sphere are the same as if the sphere were replaced by a strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere's original volume. The goal is to place an image charge `q'` at a certain location `b` from the center such that the potential on the surface `r=R` becomes zero.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are given by:\n*   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Position of the image charge (from the center): `b = R^2 / d`\n\nSo, our original system of (charge `q` + grounded sphere) is equivalent, for all points outside the sphere, to a simpler system of two point charges:\n1.  The original charge `q` at distance `d` from the origin.\n2.  The image charge `q' = -q(R/d)` at distance `b = R^2/d` from the origin, on the same line.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it induces a charge on the sphere. The force between `q` and the induced charge changes as `q` moves.\n\nA standard result in electrostatics is that the potential energy `U` of a charge distribution is `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`. For a system of a point charge `q` and a conductor, this simplifies to `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`, where `V_other` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the potential at `q` due to the induced charge.**\n    The potential created by the induced charge on the sphere at the location of `q` is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n    The distance between the original charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    The potential `V_image` at location `d` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    where `k = 1 / (4πε₀)`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`.**\n    `q' = -qR/d`\n    `b = R^2/d`\n    `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    So, the potential is:\n    `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    `V_image = - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the total potential energy `U`.**\n    Using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`, where `V_other = V_image`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4.

Understanding the Problem\nWe need to find the total potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V=0). The charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble this configuration, specifically, the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\n### 2. Method of Images\nThis problem is a classic application of the \"method of images\". This powerful technique allows us to replace the complex problem of a charge and a conductor with a simpler problem involving only point charges that replicate the electric field in the region of interest (outside the sphere).\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field and potential outside the sphere can be perfectly mimicked by:\n1.  The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n2.  An \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nThe magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at a distance R from the center) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the line connecting the center to `q`)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of this system.\n\n#### Method A: Using the Work Integral\nThe potential energy `U` is the work `W` done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. The work is done against the electric force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere.\n`U = - ∫_∞^d F_electric · dr`\n\nThe force on charge `q` due to the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. Let's say `q` is moved along the x-axis from `x = ∞` to `x = d`. The force on `q` when it is at a position `x` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\nThe image charge `q'` at this point is `-qR/x` and its position is `R^2/x`. The distance between them is `x - R^2/x`.\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThe force is attractive (negative sign). The work done by the electric field is `W_field = ∫_∞^d F(x) dx`. The potential energy is `U = -W_field`.\n`U = - ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^d x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\nUsing substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`:\n`∫ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx = (1/2) ∫ u^-2 du = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞)))]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n#### Method B: Using the General Energy Formula\nA more direct method uses the general formula for the electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges in the system.\n\nFor our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere, which has a total induced charge `Q_induced`.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * Q_induced * V_sphere`\n\n1.  Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. So the second term is zero.\n2.  `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThe beauty of the method of images is that this potential, `V_at_q`, is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   Location of `q` is `d`.\n*   Image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result. The potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere is an equipotential surface with a potential of V=0. The presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the **Method of Images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is V=0 on the surface of the sphere (at radius `r=R`).\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nIt can be shown that the boundary condition (V=0 at `r=R`) is satisfied if we place an image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. The values for `q'` and `b` are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge location:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of `q` and the grounded sphere is now electrostatically equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a system of two point charges: `q` at distance `d` from the origin and `q'` at distance `b` from the origin.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the electric field of the induced charges on the sphere. Using the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\nHowever, we must be careful. The magnitude and position of the image charge depend on the position of the real charge `q`. Therefore, we cannot simply calculate the potential energy as `k*q*q'/(d-b)`. We must calculate the work by integrating the force over the path.\n\nA more direct method is to use the general formula for electrostatic energy in the presence of conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges in the system.\n\nIn our case, the system consists of the point charge `q` and the charge distribution on the grounded sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [ q * V_sphere_at_q + ∫ V_on_sphere * σ dS ]`\n\n1.  Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_on_sphere` is 0. Therefore, the second term of the equation is zero.\n    `∫ V_on_sphere * σ dS = ∫ 0 * σ dS = 0`\n\n2.  The term `V_sphere_at_q` represents the potential at the location of the charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n    *   The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The location of `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential at `q` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n3.  Now, substitute the values of `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_sphere_at_q = - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  Finally, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere_at_q`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result represents the net potential energy of the system. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the sphere is attractive, and energy is released as the charge is brought closer from infinity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived result with the given options:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The presence of the charge `q` induces a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. The net force between the charge `q` and the sphere is attractive. We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced charges on its surface, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere.

Understanding the Physical System and Method\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed near a grounded conducting sphere. A grounded conductor is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. To find the potential and forces, the most effective method is the **method of images**.\n\n### 2. Applying the Method of Images\nThe method of images states that the electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of V=0 at all points on the surface of the sphere (where r=R).\n\nThe standard results for this configuration are:\n*   **Image charge magnitude (q'):** The image charge is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`. Its magnitude is given by:\n    `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n*   **Image charge position (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center of the sphere is:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of the original charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: `q` at distance `d` and `q'` at distance `b` from the origin.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which, by the method of images, is simply the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n\n1.  The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere is the Coulomb force between `q` and its image `q'`.\n    *   Force `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n    *   At position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The force is attractive (negative sign).\n\n2.  The potential energy `U` is the work done against this force, which is the negative of the work done by the field.\n    `U = - W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n3.  To solve the integral, we use substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫ (1/2) * (1/u^2) du`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u]` evaluated from `x=∞` to `x=d`.\n    The limits for `u` are `∞` and `d^2 - R^2`.\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential `U = (1/2)qV`**\n\n1.  The energy of a system of conductors and charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\n2.  In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, so its potential `V_sphere = 0`. Thus, its contribution to the energy sum is zero.\n\n3.  The total energy is therefore just the energy of the point charge `q` in the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the potential `V_induced` is created by the charge `q` itself. We must not double-count the interaction energy.\n\n4.  The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere (`V_induced`) is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  Now, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4.

Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A key formula for the potential energy (`U`) of a charge `q` in the presence of a grounded conductor is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere is identical to the potential created by the single image charge `q'`.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Find the potential at position `d` due to the image charge `q'`.**\n    The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center. The image charge `q'` is at a distance `b` from the center. The distance between them is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1 / (4πε₀)`).\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`.**\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Simplify the expression for `V_induced`.**\n    First, simplify the denominator:\n    `d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-qR / d] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / d * [d / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Calculate the total potential energy `U`.**\n    Now, use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4.

Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center along an axis (let's say the x-axis), so its position is `x=d`.\nThe image charge, let's call it `q'`, is placed at a position `b` along the same axis. We need to find the values of `q'` and `b` such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\nThe potential `V` at any point on the surface of the sphere is the sum of the potentials from the charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\nLet a point P on the surface of the sphere be at a distance `r_1` from `q` and `r_2` from `q'`.\nThe potential at P is `V(P) = k*q/r_1 + k*q'/r_2 = 0`.\n\nThrough geometric analysis, it can be shown that this condition is satisfied for all points on the sphere if the image charge `q'` has a magnitude and position given by:\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere (since `d > R`, it follows that `b < R`), and it has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. The force on the charge `q` at any position `x` (where `x>R`) is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on `q`.\n\nAn alternative, and simpler, method is to calculate the interaction energy of the system. The potential energy `U` of a configuration of charges is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nOur system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced surface charge `σ` on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [ q * V_induced_at_q + ∫(σ * V_sphere) dS ]`\n\n*   `V_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere.

The distance between the charge `q` (at `x`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n4.  The force exerted by the image charge on the real charge `q` is attractive:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * (x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2)`\n    `F(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n5.  The potential energy `U(d)` is the work done by the field to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is `U(d) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`. It's often easier to calculate it as `U(d) = ∫(from d to ∞) F(x) dx`.\n    `U(d) = ∫(from d to ∞) [- k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * ∫(from d to ∞) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n6.  To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n    `∫ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))`\n7.  Now, we apply the limits of integration:\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2)) ]` from `d` to `∞`\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * [ (lim x->∞ -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))) ]`\n    `U(d) = -k * q^2 * R * [ 0 + 1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    `U(d) = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n#### Method 2: Using the Potential of the Image Charge\n\nA more direct method recognizes that the interaction energy `U` of a charge `q` with an induced charge distribution on a conductor is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge distribution is created by `q` itself.\n\n1.  `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere.\n2.  This potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n3.  The distance between the location of `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n4.  The potential is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n5.  Now, we calculate the potential energy:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system:\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and the Method of Images\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has a potential of zero (V=0).\n\nTo solve this, we use the **method of images**. This method allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the sphere with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere (at a distance `R` from the center), matching the boundary condition of the grounded sphere.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Location (b)\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the origin. The image charge `q'` is placed at a distance `b` from the origin, along the same line as `q`.\n\nFor the potential on the surface of the sphere to be zero, the potential from `q` and `q'` must cancel out everywhere on the surface. The standard derivation for this setup yields the following for the image charge and its location:\n\n*   **Location of image charge (b):**\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n*   **Magnitude of image charge (q'):**\n    `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe image charge has the opposite sign to the real charge and is located inside the sphere (since `d > R`, it follows that `b < R`).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. An elegant way to calculate this energy is using the formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all other charges in the system. In our case, \"all other charges\" refers to the induced charge on the surface of the sphere.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential created by the induced surface charge is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. So, we need to find the potential created by `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n*   **The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.**\n*   **The location of the image charge `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.**\n*   **The distance between `q` and `q'` is:**\n    `distance = d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nNow, we can calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and the distance:\n\n`V_induced = k * [-q * (R / d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nFinally, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis is the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 5. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's compare our result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur derived expression `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V = 0`).\n*   A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. We assume `d > R`.\n*   The presence of the charge `q` induces an opposite charge on the surface of the conducting sphere.\n*   We need to find the total potential energy of this system (the charge `q` plus the induced charge on the sphere).\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is most easily solved using the \"method of images.\" The basic idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, equivalent \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `d'` inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r = R`) is zero.\n\nThe established results from the method of images for this scenario are:\n\n*   **Image Charge (q'):** The magnitude and sign of the image charge are given by:\n    `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    The image charge has the opposite sign to the original charge.\n\n*   **Image Position (d'):** The image charge is located along the same line as the original charge `q` and the center of the sphere, at a distance `d'` from the center:\n    `d' = R^2 / d`\n    Since `d > R`, `d'` will be less than `R`, so the image charge is correctly located inside the sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of this configuration.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force (Work Done)**\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is equal to the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n\n`U = -W_field = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) ⋅ dx`\n\nWhere `F(x)` is the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center. Using the method of images, this force is simply the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `x' = R²/x`.\n\n*   Force at distance x: `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - x'(x))^2`\n*   Substitute `q'(x) = -qR/x` and `x' = R²/x`:\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)² = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n*   The potential energy is the integral:\n    `U = - ∫[∞ to d] [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx = k * q² * R ∫[∞ to d] x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n*   To solve the integral, use the substitution `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    `∫ x / (x² - R²)² dx = ∫ (1/2) * (1/u²) du = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n*   Now, evaluate the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ] from ∞ to d`\n    `U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / ∞) ]`\n    `U = - k * q² * R / (2(d² - R²))`\n\n**Method 2: Using Potential (Simpler)**\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\nIn our case, the system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere.\n\n`U = (1/2) * [ q * V_at_q + ∫ σ * V_on_sphere dS ]`\n\n*   `V_on_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere, which is zero because it is grounded. So the integral term is zero.\n*   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   Using the method of images, this potential is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n*   Calculate the potential from the image charge `q'` at the position `d`:\n    *   The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `d'`) is `d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   The potential `V_at_q` is `k * q' / (d - d')`.\n    *   `V_at_q = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d] = -k * qR / (d² - R²)`.\n\n*   Now substitute this back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result:\n\n`U = - (1/2) * kq² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThis matches option A. The energy is negative, which is expected because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Setup and Method\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere is held at an electric potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere. The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n\nThis problem is solved using the **method of images**. The electric field and potential outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nThis arrangement ensures that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, correctly modeling the grounded conductor for the region outside the sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe work done `U` is the integral of the external force `F_ext` required to move the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. The external force is the negative of the electric force `F_elec` exerted by the induced charges on `q`.\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_ext ⋅ dx = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_elec ⋅ dx`\n\nThe electric force on `q` when it is at a variable distance `x` from the center is the same as the force exerted by its corresponding image charge `q_image(x) = -qR/x` at `b(x) = R²/x`.\nThe distance between the charge at `x` and its image is `x - b(x) = x - R²/x`.\n\nThe force is:\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * q_image / (distance)² = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F_elec(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done (potential energy):\n`U = -∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n`U = k * q² * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, let `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n`U = k * q² * R * (1/2) ∫(from x=∞ to x=d) u⁻² du`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [-1/u] (from x=∞ to x=d)`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [-1/(x² - R²)] (from ∞ to d)`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [(-1/(d² - R²)) - (-1/∞)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Interaction Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the result that for a charge `q` brought near a conductor, the total potential energy `U` is half the interaction energy of the final charge with the final induced potential.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the final position of `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. This potential is identical to the potential created by the final image charge `q' = -qR/d` at position `b = R²/d`.\n\nThe distance between the final charge `q` and its image `q'` is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\nThe potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### 4.

The Method of Images\n\nThe electric field and potential outside a grounded conducting sphere due to an external charge `q` are identical to the field and potential that would be produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere, with the sphere itself removed.\n\nThe conditions for the image charge are that the potential on the surface of the original sphere (at radius R) must be zero.\n\n*   **Original charge:** `q` at a distance `d` from the center.\n*   **Image charge:** Let the image charge be `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as `q`.\n\nTo satisfy the condition V=0 on the surface of the sphere, the magnitude and position of the image charge must be:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is now electrically equivalent to a system of two point charges: `q` and `q'`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force acting on the charge `q` during this process is the attractive force from the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\n1.  The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by its image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` which is at a distance `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n2.  The distance between the charge `q` and its image `q'` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n3.  The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`. The negative sign indicates an attractive force.\n4.  The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field: `U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`.\n5.  `U = - ∫[∞, d] (- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = k * q^2 * R * ∫[∞, d] (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n6.  Using the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`, the integral becomes `∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = -1/(2u) = -1/(2(x^2 - R^2))`.\n7.  Evaluating the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1/(2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1/(2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method B: Using Potential (with a factor of 1/2)**\n\nThe potential energy of interaction between a point charge and a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n\n1.  The potential at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) due to the induced charges is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that point.\n2.  `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n3.  `q' = -qR/d`\n4.  Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n5.  `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n6.

If we simply used `U = qV`, we would be double-counting the energy.*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\nB) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\nC) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\nD) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V=0).\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the interaction between the charge `q` and the sphere, can be calculated using the **method of images**. This method replaces the complex charge distribution induced on the sphere's surface with a single, imaginary point charge (an \"image charge\") placed inside the sphere.\n\nThe value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) becomes zero, satisfying the boundary condition for a grounded sphere.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin (0,0,0) and the real charge `q` be on the z-axis at `z = d`.\n\nThe image charge, let's call it `q'`, must also lie on the z-axis at some position `z = b` inside the sphere (`b < R`) for symmetry.\n\nThe standard results from the method of images (derived by setting the potential V=0 at the sphere's surface) are:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge (`b`):**\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge (`q'`):**\n    `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the system of the real charge `q` and the grounded sphere is electrostatically equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a system of two point charges: the real charge `q` at `z = d` and the image charge `q'` at `z = b`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it induces charges on the sphere. The work is done against the force exerted by these induced charges.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system can be calculated as:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of `1/2` is crucial because the induced charge distribution is not fixed; it is created by the presence of `q` itself.

The energy is negative because the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System and the Method of Images\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has an electric potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` induces a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition. The electric field outside the sphere is complex due to this induced charge distribution.\n\nThe \"method of images\" is a powerful technique to solve such problems. It simplifies the problem by replacing the sphere and its induced charges with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere's original volume. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is V=0 on the spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at `z = d`. We place the image charge `q'` at `z = b` along the same axis.\n\nThe potential `V` at any point on the surface of the sphere (a point at radius `R`) must be zero. The potential is the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'`.\n`V(surface) = k*q/r₁ + k*q'/r₂ = 0`\nwhere `r₁` is the distance from `q` to the point on the surface and `r₂` is the distance from `q'` to the point on the surface.\n\nBy solving this equation for all points on the sphere, we find the unique values for the image charge `q'` and its position `b`:\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R² / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the complex system of `q` and the grounded sphere is equivalent, for all points outside the sphere, to a simpler system of two point charges: `q` at `z=d` and `q' = -qR/d` at `z=R²/d`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy (U)\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. As we bring `q` in, it induces charges on the sphere, and there's a force between `q` and these induced charges.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\n\nThe force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the image charge `q' = -qR/x` at `b = R²/x`.\nThe distance between the charge and its image is `x - b = x - R²/x`.\nThe force is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)² = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work done by this electric force as the charge moves from infinity to `d`:\n`U = -W = - ∫[infinity to d] F(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫[infinity to d] (-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²) dx = k * q² * R * ∫[infinity to d] (x / (x² - R²)²) dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use u-substitution with `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`∫ (x / (x² - R²)²) dx = ∫ (1/u²) (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral:\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ]` from infinity to `d`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - R²))) ]`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(d² - R²)) - 0 ]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n#### Method B: Using Potential `U = (1/2)qV`\n\nThe total electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ qᵢVᵢ`, where `Vᵢ` is the potential at the location of charge `qᵢ` due to all *other* charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced + (1/2) * ∫ V_sphere * d(q_induced)`\nSince the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0, so the second term is zero.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\nThe potential from the image charge `q'` at the location of `q` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\nDistance = `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n`q' = -qR/d`\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d) = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d² - R²) ]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R²)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, missing 1/2, has d instead of R)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) (Incorrect, wrong denominator and numerator)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) (Correct)\n\nThe correct expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images, a common technique in electrostatics.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Problem Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (V=0).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere is created by the point charge `q` and the induced charges on the surface of the sphere. The method of images simplifies this by replacing the grounded sphere and its induced charges with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The position and magnitude of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at `x=d`. The image charge `q'` is placed at a distance `b` from the origin along the same line.\n    *   The potential `V(P)` at any point `P` on the surface of the sphere must be zero. The potential is the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'`.\n    *   Standard derivation for this setup shows that to make `V(P) = 0` for all points on the sphere's surface, the image charge must have:\n        *   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   **Position:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere. There are two common ways to calculate this:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The force on the charge `q` is due to the attraction of the induced charges on the sphere. Using the method of images, this is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n        The work done to bring `q` from infinity to `d` is the integral of the external force `F_ext = -F_electric` from infinity to `d`. The potential energy `U` is equal to this work.\n        `U = W = ∫[∞, d] F_ext dx = -∫[∞, d] F_electric dx`\n        The force on `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is:\n        `F_electric(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n        At this point, `q' = -qR/x` and `b = R^2/x`.\n        Distance = `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n        `F_electric(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n        The potential energy is the integral of this force (with a negative sign because `U = ∫ F⋅dl` from the final to the initial position, or `U = -W` where W is work done by the field):\n        `U = ∫[d, ∞] F_electric(x) dx = ∫[d, ∞] -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n        Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n        `U = -k * q^2 * (R/2) ∫[d^2-R^2, ∞] du / u^2`\n        `U = -k * q^2 * (R/2) * [-1/u] |_[d^2-R^2, ∞]`\n        `U = k * q^2 * (R/2) * [1/u] |_[d^2-R^2, ∞]`\n        `U = k * q^2 * (R/2) * [ (1/∞) - (1/(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using Potential**\n        The energy of a system of conductors and charges is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`.\n        In our case, the sphere is one conductor with `q_sphere` and `V_sphere = 0`. The point charge `q` is the other part of the system.\n        `U = (1/2) * (q_sphere * V_sphere + q * V_at_q)`\n        Since `V_sphere = 0`, this simplifies to `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`.\n        `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all other charges (i.e., the induced charges on the sphere).\n        Using the method of images, this potential is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n        Potential at `d` due to `q'` (at `b`): `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        Substitute `q' = -qR/d` and `b = R^2/d`:\n        `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n        Now, calculate the energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods yield the same result.

Understanding the Problem and Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). A grounded sphere has an electric potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` induces an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere, resulting in an attractive force between the charge and the sphere.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the **method of images**. This technique replaces the complex charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The electric field *outside* the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The magnitude and position of `q'` are chosen such that the boundary condition (V=0 on the sphere's surface) is satisfied.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by:\n\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located on the same line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common and reliable formula for the interaction energy of a charge with a system of conductors is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges in the system. In this case, `V_induced` is the potential created by the induced charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\nAccording to the method of images, this potential `V_induced` is exactly the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the position of the original charge `q`.\n\n**4. Calculating V_induced**\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at distance `d` from the center is the potential due to the image charge `q'` located at distance `b` from the center. The distance between the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n\n*   `V_induced = k * (- (R/d) * q) / (d - R^2 / d)`\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n\n*   `d - R^2 / d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n\n*   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n*   `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5.

Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the \"method of images.\" To satisfy the boundary condition that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere, we can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `d'` inside the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` are given by:\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the same line as the original charge `q`)\n\nThe negative sign of `q'` indicates that the force between the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is attractive.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n#### Method 1: Integrating the Force\n\nThe work `U` is the integral of the external force required to move the charge, which is the negative of the electric force `F(x)` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n\nAs we bring the charge `q` from a position `x` to `d`, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` also change depending on `x`. At any given position `x`, the force on charge `q` due to the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `d'(x)`.\n\n*   `q'(x) = -q * R/x`\n*   `d'(x) = R^2 / x`\n\nThe distance between the charge `q` at `x` and its image `q'(x)` at `d'(x)` is `x - d'(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on `q` is given by Coulomb's law:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - d'(x))^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done (potential energy):\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`, and `x dx = du/2`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ] (from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\nThe term with `∞` in the denominator goes to zero.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method 2: Using Potential (Shortcut)\n\nThe potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of conductors is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductors. The factor of `1/2` is crucial and arises because the induced charges are not fixed but are themselves established by `q`.\n\n1.  **Find the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge `q'`.**\n    The real charge `q` is at distance `d`. The image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at distance `d' = R^2/d`.\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `Δx = d - d' = d - R^2/d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential `V_induced`:**\n    The potential at position `d` due to the image charge is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / Δx = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / d * (1 / ((d^2 - R^2)/d))`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the potential energy `U`:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images.

Problem Setup and Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero (V=0). The charge `q` induces a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the **Method of Images**. We can replace the grounded sphere and its complex surface charge distribution with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius r=R).\n\nFor a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` are given by:\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge position (from the center, along the same line as q): `d' = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is placed inside the sphere (`d' = R^2/d < R` since `d > R`), and it has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position `d` from the sphere's center.\n\nA key principle in electrostatics states that the potential energy of a charge `q` brought into a field that it itself induces on a linear medium (like a conductor) is given by:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the final location of `q` created by the induced charges.\n\n**3. Finding the Induced Potential (V_induced)**\n\nAccording to the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere's surface is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` for all points outside the sphere.\n\nTherefore, we need to calculate the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n*   The position of `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n*   The position of the image charge `q'` is at a distance `d' = R^2 / d` from the center.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `Δx = d - d'`.\n*   `Δx = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` is the potential due to `q'`:\n`V_induced = k * q' / Δx`\nwhere `k = 1 / (4πε₀)` is Coulomb's constant.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `q'` and `Δx`:\n`V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator's denominator cancels with the `d` in the denominator's denominator:\n`V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4.

Understand the Problem and the Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero (V = 0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. To solve this problem, we use the \"method of images\". This method replaces the complex charge distribution on the sphere with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The position and magnitude of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero, matching the condition of the grounded sphere.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nThrough standard derivation, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center of the sphere are found to be:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   The charge is opposite in sign to `q`, which makes sense as it creates an attractive force.\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   The image charge is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the charge `q`. Since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), it follows that `b < R`, so the image charge is correctly located inside the sphere.\n\nNow, the system of the real charge `q` and the grounded sphere is electrostatically equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a system of two point charges: the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` from the center of the sphere.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\nThe force on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\nThe distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\nThe force of attraction between them is:\n`F = k * |q*q'| / (d-b)^2`\n\nHowever, as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity, the position (`b`) and magnitude (`q'`) of the image charge change. The work done is the integral of the force from infinity to `d`.\n`U = W = ∫_∞^d F(x) dx`\nwhere `x` is the variable distance from the center.\nThe force at any distance `x` is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\nIntegrating this gives the potential energy:\n`U = ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = [ (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (x^2 - R^2) ]_∞^d`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2) - 0 = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nWait, the force is attractive, so the potential energy should be negative. The work done *by the field* is positive, so the potential energy (work done against the field) is negative.\n`U = -W_field = -(Work done by attractive force)`\nThe correct potential energy calculation yields:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula `U = (1/2) qV`**\nA more direct method uses the general formula for electrostatic energy `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`.

The method of images tells us that this force is exactly the same as the force exerted by the fictitious image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Force:** Let's calculate the force `F(x)` on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center (`x > R`).\n    *   The image charge at this point would be `q'(x) = -q * (R/x)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge would be `b(x) = R^2 / x`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `x`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b(x)`) is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force between them (which is the force on `q` from the sphere) is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n        `F(x) = k * q * [-q(R/x)] / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n        `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R) / x / [(x^2 - R^2)/x]^2`\n        `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R) / x * [x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2]`\n        `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive (towards the sphere).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Work Done (Potential Energy):** The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to assemble it. We can calculate this by integrating the force required to move the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. The change in potential energy is the negative of the work done by the conservative electric field.\n    `U(d) - U(∞) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    Assuming `U(∞) = 0`, we get:\n    `U(d) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n7.  **Solve the Integral:** We use a substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du / 2`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    `∫ [1 / u^2] * (du / 2) = (1/2) * ∫ u^(-2) du = (1/2) * (-1 * u^(-1)) = -1 / (2u)`\n    Substituting back `u = x^2 - R^2`, the integral is `-1 / [2(x^2 - R^2)]`.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:**\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * { [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - [-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))] }`\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * { [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - 0 }`\n    `U(d) = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\n9.  **Final Result:**\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n10. **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   B) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   C) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur derived result matches option D perfectly.\n\n### Alternative reasoning for the 1/2 factor\nThe interaction energy can also be found by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the position of `q` due to the induced charge on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (and its potential) is created by and is proportional to `q` itself.\n*   `V_induced` at `d` is the potential from the image charge `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * [-q(R/d)] / (d - R^2/d) = -k*q*R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k*q*R / (d^2 - R^2)] = -(1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nThis confirms the result again.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Setup**\n\nWe have a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. This means its electrical potential is fixed at zero (`V=0`). A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`.\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will polarize the sphere, inducing surface charges on it. These induced charges will create their own electric field. The net potential energy of the system is the energy stored in the total electric field, which is equivalent to the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at `d`.\n\n### **2. Apply the Method of Images**\n\nThis problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images\". The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nLet's find the magnitude (`q'`) and position (`b` from the center) of this image charge. The key condition is that the sum of the potentials from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must be zero everywhere on the surface of the sphere (since it's grounded).\n\nLet's place the center of the sphere at the origin and the charge `q` on the x-axis at `x=d`. The image charge `q'` will also be on the x-axis at `x=b`.\n\nThe potential at any point `P` on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) must be zero.\nPotential due to `q`: `V_q = kq / r_1`\nPotential due to `q'`: `V_{q'} = kq' / r_2`\n\nwhere `r_1` is the distance from `q` to `P` and `r_2` is the distance from `q'` to `P`.\n\nBy solving the equation `V_q + V_{q'} = 0` for all points on the surface, we find the following for the image charge:\n\n*   **Position of image charge (`b`):** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge (`q'`):** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the complex system of the point charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to a simpler system of two point charges: the original charge `q` at `d` and an image charge `q' = -q(R/d)` at `b = R^2/d`. This equivalence is valid for calculating the field and potential *outside* the sphere.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the sphere's center. This work is done against the force exerted by the sphere (i.e., by the induced charges). This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nA more direct way to calculate the potential energy (`U`) of the interaction is using the formula:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` that is created by all *other* charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charges are not fixed; their distribution changes as `q` is brought in from infinity.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at distance `d` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\n1.  **Calculate the distance between `q` and `q'`:**\n    The distance is `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential `V_induced` at `d`:**\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the total potential energy `U`:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### **4. Final Answer Check**\n\nThe derived expression for the potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nLet's compare this with the given options:\n\nA) `U = - kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n\nOur result perfectly matches option B. The negative sign is physically correct, indicating that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the system's energy is lower than when the charge is at infinity (U=0).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded conducting sphere is an equipotential surface with a potential of `V=0`.\n\nThis electrostatic problem can be simplified using the **method of images**. We can replace the conducting sphere and its induced surface charge with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`) is zero.\n\nThe standard results for the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to `q`) are:\n*   **Image charge value:** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe electric field and potential *outside* the sphere (`r > R`) are now correctly described by the superposition of the fields from the original point charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the potential is zero) to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere, while the sphere is held at `V=0`.\n\n`U = W_ext = ∫_∞^d F_ext ⋅ dr`\n\nWhere `F_ext` is the external force required to move the charge, which is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force `F_e` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n\n`F_ext = - F_e`\n\nThe force `F_e` exerted by the induced charges on the sphere on the charge `q` is, by the method of images, equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on `q`.\n\nLet's calculate this force when the charge `q` is at a generic distance `x` from the center (`x > R`):\n*   Force on `q` due to `q'`: `F_e(x)`\n*   Position of `q`: `x`\n*   Position of `q'(x)`: `b(x) = R^2/x`\n*   Value of `q'(x)`: `q'(x) = - (R/x) * q`\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`\n\nThe force is attractive (towards the sphere):\n`F_e(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n`F_e(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F_e(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F_e(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * (x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2)`\n`F_e(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done (potential energy `U`):\n`U = ∫_∞^d F_ext dx = ∫_∞^d -F_e(x) dx`\n`U = ∫_∞^d [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve this integral, we use a substitution:\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du/2`.\n\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫ u^-2 du`\n\nThe integral of `u^-2` is `-u^-1 = -1/u`.\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]` (evaluated at the bounds corresponding to `x`)\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1 / (x^2 - R^2)] |_∞^d`\n\nNow, apply the limits:\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ (-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - (-1 / (∞^2 - R^2)) ]`\nThe term with infinity goes to zero.\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1 / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3. Alternative Method (Using Potential)\n\nThe interaction energy of a charge distribution is `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`.

This self-energy of `q` is not included.\n*   This potential from the induced charges is, by the method of images, the same as the potential from the image charge `q'`.\n\nSo, `V_q = V_induced = V_from_q'`.\nThe distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b=R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option C.\n\nLet's quickly check the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect, has `R^2`.\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect, missing `1/2` and has `d` instead of `R`.\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct.**\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect denominator and numerator.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a charge reservoir (the Earth) and is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0).

Understanding the Problem and Choosing the Right Method\n\nThe problem asks for the potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere has its electric potential maintained at zero (V=0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charge on the surface of the conducting sphere. The total potential energy is the work done to assemble this configuration. Specifically, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to a distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nThe most effective way to solve this electrostatic problem is the **method of images**. This method simplifies the problem by replacing the conducting sphere and its complex induced surface charge with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet:\n*   `R` be the radius of the sphere.\n*   The center of the sphere be the origin (0, 0, 0).\n*   The real charge `q` be placed on the z-axis at a distance `d` from the center (i.e., at `z = d`).\n*   The image charge, `q'`, be placed at a distance `b` from the center along the same axis (at `z = b`), where `b < R`.\n\nThe potential at any point on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) must be zero. The total potential is the sum of the potential from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n`V(surface) = V_q + V_{q'} = 0`\n`k * q / (distance from q) + k * q' / (distance from q') = 0`\n\nBy solving this equation for all points on the surface, we can find the unique values for `q'` and `b`. The standard result from the method of images for a grounded sphere is:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the complex system of the charge `q` and the grounded sphere can be replaced by a much simpler system of two point charges: `q` at `z=d` and `q'` at `z=b`, for calculating the field and potential *outside* the sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`. This work is done against the force exerted on `q` by the induced charges on the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the charge `q` in the potential created by the induced charge (`V_induced`) is given by:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nA factor of 1/2 is essential here. The potential `V_induced` is not a fixed external potential; it is created by the presence of `q` itself. As `q` is brought from infinity, the induced charge on the sphere builds up from zero. The work done is `W = ∫ F⋅dl`. The force `F` on `q` due to the induced charge is proportional to `q`. The induced charge itself is also proportional to `q`. Therefore, the force is proportional to `q^2`, and the potential energy, which is the integral of this force, is also proportional to `q^2`. A detailed derivation shows the work done is `(1/2)QV`, not just `QV`.\n\nNow, we calculate `V_induced` at the location of charge `q`. In the method of images, this is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the position `d`.\n\n*   The image charge `q'` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n*   The real charge `q` is at `d`.\n*   The distance between them is `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced = V_{q'} = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the potential expression:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this potential back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Comparing with Options\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect.\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **This matches our result.**\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n\nThe correct expression for the net potential energy of the system is given by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical System and Method\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed near a grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere has its potential fixed at zero (V=0). The charge `q` induces an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere. Calculating the potential energy directly from this induced charge distribution is difficult.\n\nThe standard and most elegant way to solve this problem is using the **method of images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the boundary condition (V=0 on the sphere's surface) is satisfied. For an observer outside the sphere, the electric field and potential due to the sphere's induced charges are identical to the field and potential created by the image charge.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)\nLet the center of the sphere of radius `R` be at the origin. The point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center (let's say on the z-axis, at z=d).\n\nThe image charge `q'` is placed at a distance `b` from the center along the same axis. For the potential on the surface of the sphere (where the distance from the origin is `r=R`) to be zero, the position and magnitude of the image charge must be:\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThis is a standard result from electrostatics. With the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'`, the potential at `r=R` is zero, satisfying the condition for a grounded sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is stored as potential energy in the electric field.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\nThe force on the real charge `q` is due to the electric field of the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nLet's calculate the force on `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center (`x > R`). At this point, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at a position `b(x) = R^2/x`. The force is the Coulomb force between `q` and `q'(x)`:\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n*   Force `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R*x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\nThe negative sign indicates the force is attractive.\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external force to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is the negative of the work done by the electrostatic field:\n`U = W_ext = - integral(∞ to d) [F(x) dx]`\n`U = - integral(∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R*x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * integral(∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\nThe integral becomes `integral(1/(2u^2) du) = -1/(2u) = -1/(2(x^2 - R^2))`.\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1/(2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1/(2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula\nThe potential energy `U` of a system of charges and conductors can be expressed as `U = (1/2) * Σ(q_i * V_i)`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nIn our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere (whose potential `V_sphere` is 0).\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced + (1/2) * Q_induced * V_sphere`\nSince `V_sphere = 0`, the second term vanishes.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n`V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charge on the sphere. By the method of images, this is equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n*   `q' = -qR/d`\n*   Distance from image charge (at `b = R^2/d`) to the point `d` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system.\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U = - k*q^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U = - (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition on its surface. We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This problem can be simplified using the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced charges on its surface, can be exactly replicated by a single fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere. The potential on the surface of the sphere due to the external charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must be zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at `x=d`. The image charge `q'` is placed at a position `b` from the center along the line connecting the center and `q`. Through calculations that enforce the V=0 condition on the sphere's surface, the parameters of the image charge are found to be:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n    The image charge is located inside the sphere (since d > R, then b < R) and has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external force to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The external force required is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force exerted on `q` by the grounded sphere. By the method of images, this electrostatic force is the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    Let's calculate this work by integrating the force:\n    *   The potential energy `U` is given by the integral of the external force `F_ext` from infinity to `d`. `U = ∫[∞, d] F_ext dx`.\n    *   The external force is opposite to the electrostatic force between `q` and the sphere: `F_ext = -F_elec`.\n    *   The electrostatic force on charge `q` when it is at a variable distance `x` from the center is the force from its corresponding image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n        *   `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n        *   `b(x) = R^2/x`\n        *   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force is `F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`.\n        `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n        This is an attractive force (negative sign).\n    *   The external force is `F_ext(x) = -F_elec(x) = k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    *   Now, we integrate to find the potential energy `U`:\n        `U = ∫[∞, d] F_ext(x) dx = ∫[∞, d] [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    *   To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`.\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * ∫[∞, d^2-R^2] (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * ∫ u^-2 du`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-u^-1]_∞^(d^2-R^2)`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]_∞^(d^2-R^2)`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞) ]`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) ]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Alternative (Shortcut) Method:**\n    The interaction energy of the system can also be found using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges (or, equivalently, by the image charge).\n    *   `V_induced` at distance `d` is the potential from `q'` at distance `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / d / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Now, calculate the energy:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A.

The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the sphere's center (`d > R`). The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at a constant value, V = 0. We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** The electric field outside the conducting sphere is identical to the field that would be created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific point `b` inside the sphere (while removing the sphere itself). The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface where the conductor used to be is zero.\n\n    *   For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are given by:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge position: `b = R^2/d` (measured from the center, along the same line as `q`).\n\n    This image system (`q` at `d` and `q'` at `b`) perfectly replicates the electric field outside `r=R` and guarantees that the potential at `r=R` is zero.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to assemble it. A general formula for the potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ_i q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges in the system.\n\n    *   Our system consists of the point charge `q` and the conducting sphere. So the energy can be written as the sum of the energy associated with the point charge and the energy associated with the charge distribution on the sphere:\n        `U = (1/2) q V_at_q + (1/2) ∫ V_sphere σ dA`\n\n    *   The second term represents the energy of the induced charges `σ` on the sphere's surface. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0 everywhere on its surface. Therefore, the second term `(1/2) ∫ (0) σ dA = 0`.\n\n    *   This leaves us with `U = (1/2) q V_at_q`. Here, `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all *other* charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    *   According to the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the potential created by the single image charge `q'`.\n\n    *   So, we need to calculate the potential at position `d` (where `q` is located) due to the image charge `q'` at position `b`. The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n        `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_at_q = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_at_q`:\n        `V_at_q = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\n    *   Cancel the `d` from the numerator's and denominator's fractions:\n        `V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   Finally, substitute this potential back into the formula for the total energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) q V_at_q`\n        `U = (1/2) q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.

As the position of `q` changes (let's call its variable position `x`), the magnitude and position of its image also change (`q'(x) = -qR/x`, `b(x) = R²/x`).\n\nThe attractive force on charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nThe potential energy `U` is:\n`U = -W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n`U = k * q² * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n`∫ [x / (x² - R²)²] dx = ∫ [1/u²] (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral:\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ](from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - R²))) ]`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(d² - R²)) - 0 ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Interaction Energy of the Image System**\n\nA well-known result from electrostatics states that the potential energy of a point charge `q` in the presence of a grounded conductor is equal to half the interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'`.\n\n`U = (1/2) * U_interaction = (1/2) * (k * q * q' / r)`\n\nwhere `r` is the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n*   `r = d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n*   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nNow, substitute these into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * k * q * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\nThe `d` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out.\n`U = (1/2) * k * q * [-qR] / [d² - R²]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system:\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThis expression is negative, which is expected because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere (as the induced charge is of the opposite sign overall).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) `U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   B) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   C) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   D) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\n\nOur derived formula `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)` exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System and the Problem:**\n    The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has a constant potential of zero (V=0).\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    To solve this electrostatics problem, we use the method of images. This technique allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conducting sphere with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are the same in both the original problem and the simplified image-charge problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` must be placed such that the potential at the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero. The established results for this configuration are:\n    *   The position of the image charge, `b`, from the center along the line connecting the center and `q`, is `b = R^2 / d`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. As the charge `q` is brought in, the sphere remains grounded, and an induced charge builds up on its surface. The force on `q` is due to this induced charge.\n\n    Using the method of images, the force on `q` is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. However, it's crucial to realize that as `q` moves from infinity to `d`, the image charge `q'` also changes its magnitude and position. Therefore, we must integrate the force over the path.\n\n    Let's consider an intermediate position `x` for the charge `q` (`x > R`). At this point:\n    *   The image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x`.\n    *   Its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\n    The force on charge `q` at position `x` is the attractive Coulomb force from the image charge:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2) = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field:\n    `U = - W_field = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫[from ∞ to d] [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R) ∫[from ∞ to d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`. The limits of integration become:\n    *   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n    *   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R) ∫[from ∞ to d^2-R^2] (1/u^2) (du/2)`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u] |_[from ∞ to d^2-R^2]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞) ]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * (k * q^2 * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is grounded, which means its electric potential is maintained at zero (`V = 0`).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be simplified. We can replace the sphere and its induced charges with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    The image charge lies on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common misconception is to simply calculate the potential energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct way is to consider that the induced charge (and thus the image charge) changes as `q` is brought closer.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the interaction between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere can be found by calculating half the potential energy of `q` in the field of its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge on the sphere is created by the field of `q` itself; the system's energy is built up gradually.\n\n    *   The potential at the location of charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is `V_image`.\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential `V_image` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   The potential energy `U` of the system is half the product of the charge `q` and the potential at its location due to the other charges (which are represented by the image charge).\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R^2)\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)   (Correct)\n    C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)       (Incorrect, misses 1/2 and has 'd' in numerator)\n    D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)   (Incorrect, has 'd' in numerator and '+' in denominator)\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images in electrostatics.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** We need to find the total potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. The work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position is equal to the potential energy of the system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere due to the induced charges on its surface can be modeled by a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (since it's grounded).\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n    These values are chosen precisely so that the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'` is zero at any point on the spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    A crucial point in the method of images is that the potential energy of the *actual* system (charge `q` and the sphere) is **not** simply the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. This is because the image charge itself doesn't have its own energy; it's a mathematical construct representing the induced field.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the potential energy `U` is to find the potential `V'` created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`, and then the energy is `U = (1/2) * q * V'`. The factor of 1/2 is essential and arises because the induced charge (and thus the image charge) builds up as the real charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n5.  **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n    *   **Image charge:** `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   **Image position:** `b = R^2/d`\n    *   **Distance between real charge `q` and image charge `q'`:**\n        `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   **Potential `V'` at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'`:**\n        `V' = k * q' / (distance)`\n        `V' = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        By canceling `d` from the numerator and denominator, we get:\n        `V' = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   **Calculate the net potential energy `U` of the system:**\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V'`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated expression for the potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option D.\n\nThe energy is negative, which is physically correct because the charge `q` is attracted to the conducting sphere (as the induced charge on the closer surface is of the opposite sign), meaning the system is in a lower energy state than when the charge is infinitely far away (U=0).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. This technique simplifies the problem of a charge near a conductor by replacing the conductor with a fictional \"image charge\" that, along with the original charge, satisfies the boundary conditions of the original problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is constant and equal to zero (V = 0).

The charge `q` is at `z = d`. The image charge `q'` will be at `z = d'`.\n    *   The potential at any point `P` on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) must be zero. The potential at `P` is the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'`.\n    *   For this to be true for all points on the sphere, it can be shown that the image charge and its position must be:\n        *   **Location:** `d' = R² / d` (Note that since `d > R`, we have `d' < R`, so the image charge is inside the sphere).\n        *   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R / d)` (The image charge has the opposite sign to the original charge).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    *   The potential energy of the original system (charge `q` and the grounded sphere) is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n    *   As the charge `q` is brought from infinity, the induced charges on the sphere exert an attractive force on it. The potential energy of the system is the work done by the field (or the negative of the work done by an external agent).\n    *   A straightforward way to calculate this energy `U` is to use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n    *   By the method of images, the potential created by the induced surface charges is identical to the potential created by the single image charge `q'`.\n    *   So, `V_induced` at the position of `q` (at distance `d` from the center) is simply the potential created by `q'` (at distance `d'` from the center).\n        *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - d'`.\n        *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'` into the formula for `V_induced`:\n        *   `d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²) / d`\n        *   `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²) / d)`\n    *   `V_induced = -k * qR / (d² - R²) `\n    *   Now, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n        *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d² - R²)]`\n        *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated expression is `U = - (1/2) * kq² * R / (d² - R²)`.\n    *   This matches option (D).\n\n*Self-Correction/Alternative Check:* The interaction energy of the image system (`q` and `q'`) is `U_image = kqq' / (d-d') = -kq²R / (d²-R²)`. The potential energy of the charge-conductor system is known to be half of this interaction energy, `U = (1/2)U_image`, which gives the same result. The reason for the factor of 1/2 is that the energy is stored in the electric field, which only exists in the region *outside* the sphere (`r > R`), whereas the field for the two-charge image system exists everywhere.\n\nFinal calculation confirms the result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the potential energy of the system.\n\n**1.

The Method of Images**\nTo solve this problem, we use the method of images. This powerful technique allows us to replace the complex problem of a charge and a conductor with a simpler problem involving only point charges.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field *outside* the sphere is identical to the field produced by:\n*   The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n*   An \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.

Calculating the Potential Energy**\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The force acting on the charge `q` is the attractive force from the induced charges on the sphere's surface. According to the method of images, this force is exactly the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\nThe work `W` done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity (`x = ∞`) to the distance `d` is equal to the potential energy `U`. This work is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n\n`U = W = - ∫[∞→d] F(x) ⋅ dx = ∫[d→∞] F(x) dx`\n\nHere, `F(x)` is the electrostatic force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center. This force is due to the image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` located at `b(x) = R²/x`.\n\n*   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R²/x`.\n*   The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))²`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n    `F(x) = -kq²R/x / ((x²-R²)/x)² = -kq²R/x * x²/(x²-R²)² = -kq²Rx / (x²-R²)²`\n\nNow, we integrate this force:\n`U = ∫[d→∞] (-kq²Rx / (x²-R²)²) dx`\n`U = -kq²R ∫[d→∞] (x / (x²-R²)²) dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x² - R²`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\nThe limits of integration change from `x=d` to `u = d²-R²` and `x→∞` to `u→∞`.\n\n`U = -kq²R ∫[d²-R²→∞] (1/u²) (du/2)`\n`U = -(kq²R/2) * [ -1/u ]_[d²-R²→∞]`\n`U = -(kq²R/2) * [ (lim u→∞ -1/u) - (-1/(d²-R²)) ]`\n`U = -(kq²R/2) * [ 0 + 1/(d²-R²) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * kq²R / (d²-R²)`\n\n**Method 2: Using Potential Energy Formula (with a subtlety)**\nThe potential energy of the interaction is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the final location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges (i.e., the induced charge on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge itself is created by the presence of `q`, so we must average over the charging process.\n\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at distance `d` from the center, caused by the image charge `q'` at position `b`.\n*   The distance between the final position of `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n*   `q' = -qR/d`.\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -kqR / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, calculate the energy:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -kqR / (d²-R²) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * kq²R / (d²-R²)`\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth methods yield the same result.

The external force `F_ext` is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force `F_elec` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`. So, `U = W = -∫_∞^d F_elec(x) dx`.\n    *   The force `F_elec` on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` at `b = R^2/x`.\n    *   `F_elec(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)² = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n    *   `F_elec(x) = -k * q² * R / (x * (x²-R²)/x)² = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n    *   Now, we integrate to find the energy `U`:\n        `U = - ∫_∞^d F_elec(x) dx = - ∫_∞^d [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n        `U = k * q² * R ∫_∞^d x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n    *   Let's use a u-substitution: `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n        `U = k * q² * R * (1/2) ∫_∞^{d²-R²} 1/u² du`\n        `U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [-1/u]_∞^{d²-R²}`\n        `U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [-1/(d² - R²) - (-1/∞)]`\n        `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n    **Method B: Using Potential (Simpler Approach)**\n    *   The potential energy `U` of the interaction can be calculated as `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.

A powerful technique for solving such problems is the method of images.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the conducting sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere's original volume. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (since it is grounded).\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n\n*   Located at a distance `d'` from the center, on the line connecting the center and `q`.\n    `d' = R^2 / d`\n*   Has a magnitude:\n    `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\nThe image charge `q'` has the opposite sign to `q`, which indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the sphere is attractive.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance (where potential energy is zero) to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center. We can calculate this using two common methods.\n\n#### Method A: Integrating the Force\n\n1.  **Force on the charge q**: The force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere is equivalent to the electrostatic force exerted by the image charge `q'`. At this point, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at a position `d'(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between `q` and `q'` is `x - d'(x)`.\n    The force `F(x)` is:\n    `F(x) = k * (q * q') / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * (q * (-qR/x)) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * (R/x) / ((x^2-R^2)/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates the force is attractive (directed towards the sphere).\n\n2.  **Work and Potential Energy**: The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the field.\n    `U = W_agent = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫[∞, d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which means `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n    `∫ (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\n    Now, we evaluate the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method B: Using Potential `U = (1/2) qV`\n\n1.  **Energy Formula**: For a system of a point charge and a grounded conductor, the total potential energy is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is created by `q` itself.\n\n2.  **Induced Potential**: By the method of images, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q` (distance `d`).\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate Energy**: Now substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the potential energy of the system:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect `R^2`\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect numerator and missing factor of 1/2.\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct match.**\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect numerator and denominator.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of image charges. The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to a distance `d` from the center of the sphere.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is grounded, which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V=0`).\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Image Charges:** To solve this problem, we can replace the grounded conducting sphere with an equivalent \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The potential outside the sphere is then the superposition of the potentials of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The magnitude and position of `q'` are chosen such that the potential on the surface where the sphere was (at radius `r=R`) is zero.\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    *   Let the real charge `q` be on the z-axis at `z=d`.\n    *   For the potential to be zero on the spherical surface `r=R`, the image charge `q'` must be placed on the z-axis at a position `z = d'`.\n    *   From standard electrostatics theory, the image charge and its position are given by:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. A simpler way to calculate this energy is using the formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    Where `V_induced` is the potential at the final position of the charge `q` due to all other charges in the system (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charges themselves build up as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential `V_induced`:**\n    *   The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d` from the center) due to the induced surface charge is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `(d - d')`.\n    *   So, the potential is: `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Now substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    *   The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`:**\n    *   Now, use the energy formula from step 4:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   This gives the final expression for the potential energy:\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The derived expression `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images, a fundamental technique in electrostatics for problems involving charges and conductors.\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere are the same as if the sphere were replaced by a specific \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (since it is grounded).\n\n*   **System:** A point charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is grounded (V=0).\n*   **Equivalent System:** The real charge `q` and an image charge `q'` located at a distance `d'` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (d')**\n\nFor a grounded sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at distance `d` from its center, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located inside the sphere (`d' < R` since `d > R`), and it has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy (U)**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it induces charges on the sphere. The potential energy is the interaction energy between the charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere.\n\nA key result from electrostatic theory is that the interaction energy `U` between a point charge and a conductor is half the product of the charge and the potential at its location due to the induced charges. The potential from the induced charges is identical to the potential from the image charge.\n\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere `V_induced` is the potential at the position of the real charge `q` created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nLet's calculate `V_induced`:\n\n*   The image charge `q'` is at a distance `d'` from the center.\n*   The real charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `(d - d')`.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n\n`V_induced = k * [ - (R/d) * q ] / [ d - (R^2/d) ]`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * [ - (R/d) * q ] / [ (d^2 - R^2) / d ]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n`V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, we can calculate the potential energy `U` using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result is negative, which makes physical sense.

This method allows us to replace a complex system (a charge and a conducting object) with a simpler system of point charges that produces the same electric field in the region of interest (outside the sphere).\n\n### 1. The Method of Image Charges\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (`d > R`), the electric field outside the sphere can be reproduced by:\n1.  The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n2.  An \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`) is zero, which is the condition for a grounded sphere. Through calculation, the image charge `q'` is found to be:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` from the center of the sphere. The sphere itself is grounded, so we only need to consider the work done on the charge `q`.\n\nThe force on the charge `q` at any position `x` (from the center) is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n\nAt an arbitrary distance `x` from the center, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between the real charge `q` and its image `q'` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on charge `q` is therefore:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)²`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = - (k * q² * R / x) / ((x² - R²)/x)²`\n`F(x) = - (k * q² * R / x) * (x² / (x² - R²)²)`\n`F(x) = - k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nThis force is attractive (negative sign), pulling `q` towards the sphere.\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from `x=∞` to `x=d` against this electric force.\n`U = W_ext = ∫[from ∞ to d] F_ext dx = ∫[from ∞ to d] -F(x) dx`\n`U = ∫[from ∞ to d] -[- k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n`U = k * q² * R ∫[from ∞ to d] x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use u-substitution. Let `u = x² - R²`, then `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\nThe integral becomes:\n`∫ (1/u²) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ]` evaluated from `x=∞` to `x=d`.\n`U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - R²))) ]`\nSince `1/∞ -> 0`, the second term vanishes.\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(d² - R²)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n### 3. Alternative (Simpler) Method\n\nA known result from the method of images is that the potential energy of interaction between a charge `q` and the induced charge on a grounded conductor is **one-half** of the potential energy between the charge `q` and its image charge `q'`.\n\n1.  Potential energy between `q` and `q'`:\n    `U_image = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n    The distance between them is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    `U_image = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n    `U_image = - k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n2.  The actual potential energy of the system is half of this value:\n    `U_system = (1/2) * U_image`\n    `U_system = (1/2) * [- k * q² * R / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U_system = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem can be solved using the **method of images**.

The grounded conducting sphere has radius `R`, which means its surface potential is V = 0.\nThe real charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center (let's say on the z-axis, at z = d).\n\nFor the potential on the surface of the sphere to be zero, we need to place an image charge `q'` at a position `b` (also on the z-axis) inside the sphere. The values for `q'` and `b` that satisfy the V=0 boundary condition are:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\nThese values ensure that for any point on the sphere's surface (at radius R), the potential from `q` and `q'` sum to zero.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nA standard formula for the interaction energy `U` of a point charge `q` with a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\n1.  **Find the potential at position `d` due to the image charge `q'`:**\n    The image charge `q'` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n    The charge `q` is at `d`.\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `distance = d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n    The potential `V_induced` at position `d` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    By canceling out `d` from the numerator and the denominator, we get:\n    `V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the net potential energy `U`:**\n    Now, we use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The factor of 1/2 is present because the induced charge distribution is itself created by `q`, so the work is not simply `q * V_final` but an integral that results in the factor of 1/2.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) `U = - kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThis problem requires the use of the method of image charges to find the potential energy of the system.\n\n**1.

Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it induces a charge on the sphere. The force between `q` and the induced charge changes as `q` moves.\n\nA standard result in electrostatics is that the potential energy `U` of a charge distribution is `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`. For a system of a point charge `q` and a conductor, this simplifies to `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`, where `V_other` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the potential at `q` due to the induced charge.**\n    The potential created by the induced charge on the sphere at the location of `q` is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n    The distance between the original charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    The potential `V_image` at location `d` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    where `k = 1 / (4πε₀)`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`.**\n    `q' = -qR/d`\n    `b = R^2/d`\n    `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    So, the potential is:\n    `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    `V_image = - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the total potential energy `U`.**\n    Using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`, where `V_other = V_image`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4.
