This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2   H\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition (the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   A mnemonic for stereochemistry is that a *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The product is a trans-epoxide. For a symmetrically substituted alkene like oct-4-ene, this results in a pair of enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide by a nucleophile (H₂O in this case) proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   The overall reaction from alkene to diol is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical mnemonic for this is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n    *   Let's verify this through the mechanism: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxides reacts with water.\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O (anti-attack) → (4R,5S)-diol (a meso compound). Attack at C4 inverts it to S, attack at C5 inverts it to S. Wait, let's re-verify. Attack at C4 (R) inverts its configuration to S, while C5 remains R, yielding (4S,5R)-diol. Attack at C5 (R) inverts its configuration to S, while C4 remains R, yielding (4R,5S)-diol. Both (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) describe the same achiral meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O (anti-attack) → also yields the same (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is one achiral compound. Let's label it **M**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The mnemonic is that a *cis*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a meso compound.\n    *   The product is a cis-epoxide, which for a symmetrically substituted alkene is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical mnemonic is: **(Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify mechanistically: The meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxide) reacts.\n        *   Attack at the C4 (R) carbon inverts its configuration to S. The C5 (S) configuration is retained. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at the C5 (S) carbon inverts its configuration to R. The C4 (R) configuration is retained. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the attacks on C4 and C5 are equally probable, producing a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's label these enantiomers **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   **R**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **S**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **R**.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **S**.\n\n### **HPLC Chromatogram Prediction**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M vs. R, and M vs. S) have different physical properties and will have different retention times, thus separating into different peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (R vs. S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the unresolved racemic pair (R+S).\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n    *   It can separate diastereomers (as any column can, in principle).\n    *   Crucially, it can also resolve enantiomers. The interactions (R)-chiral column and (S)-chiral column are diastereomeric and have different energies, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Since M, R, and S are all distinct stereoisomers, and a chiral column can distinguish between all of them (diastereomers M vs. R/S, and enantiomers R vs. S), all three compounds will be resolved.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three peaks: one for M, one for R, and one for S.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical around the double bond, with a propyl group on each side.\n    ```\n        H       CH₂CH₂CH₃\n       / \\     /\n      C = C\n     /     \\   /\n    CH₃CH₂CH₂ H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This reaction is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides.\n    *   Products: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening with H₂O.** The protonated epoxide is attacked by water in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond (anti-attack), leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked. The overall process from alkene to diol is an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions is **\"TAM\"**: **T**rans-alkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **M**eso compound (when the alkene is symmetrical, as it is here).\n    *   Let's verify this. Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide, anti-attack by water at either C4 or C5 (which are equivalent) will lead to the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Similarly, starting with (4S,5S)-epoxide will lead to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   A compound with two equivalent chiral centers with (R,S) configuration is a meso compound. (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) are different labels for the same single meso molecule due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetrical.\n    ```\n        CH₃CH₂CH₂   CH₂CH₂CH₃\n             \\   /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n            H   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1 & 2: mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺.** This is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Another useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"**: **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **R**acemic mixture (when the alkene is symmetrical).\n    *   Let's verify this. Epoxidation of the cis-alkene gives a meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). Anti-attack by water on this meso-epoxide at C4 (which is R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol. Anti-attack at C5 (which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. Since the starting meso-epoxide is achiral, the attacks are equally probable, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the stereochemical relationships:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (meso) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated (they co-elute).\n    *   Therefore, the meso-diol (1) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair (2+3). The enantiomers (2 and 3) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   It can separate diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, it can also separate enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct compounds in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the products using different chromatographic techniques.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   H\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n               H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reagents and Transformation:**\n    *   **Step 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid)**. This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Reacting the *trans*-alkene with mCPBA can occur from the top or bottom face, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺)**. This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite the epoxide ring, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation. There is a general rule for the stereochemistry of such additions:\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a **meso** compound (if the product molecule has a plane of symmetry, which octane-4,5-diol does).\n\n    Let's verify this. Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, backside attack by water at either C4 or C5 will invert the stereocenter, leading to (4S,5R)- or (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are, in fact, the same meso compound. The same meso product is formed from the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n    Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol** [(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol].\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n               H   H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reagents and Transformation:** The reagents and overall transformation are the same as in Reaction 1: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the corresponding stereochemical rule:\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n\n    Let's verify. The epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene produces a single, achiral *meso*-epoxide [(cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane]. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening involves water attacking the two prochiral carbons (C4 and C5) from the backside. Attack at C4 and attack at C5 are equally probable and lead to a pair of enantiomeric products.\n    Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis (HPLC)**\n\nThe question assumes the highest theoretically possible resolution.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the (4R,5R)/(4S,5S) pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated on a standard achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The achiral HPLC will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: Meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   It can separate all stereoisomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities, which causes them to have different retention times.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are also readily separated.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture. It will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: Meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   Structure: CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃ (propyl groups are *trans* to each other).\n\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   A useful stereochemistry rule is: a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face of the planar double bond with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from one face yields the (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the other face yields the (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers. Thus, this step produces a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide.\n\n*   **Step 1b: Epoxide opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).**\n    *   The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The overall reaction from alkene to diol is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   Another key stereochemistry rule is: a reaction pathway that involves an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (if the product structure allows for it). The mnemonic \"Trans-Anti-Meso\" (T.A.M) can be helpful here.\n    *   Let's verify this. We start with the racemic epoxide from the previous step.\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide: The incoming water molecule attacks one of the carbons from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (anti-attack). This inverts the stereocenter it attacks. For example, attack at C4 changes its configuration from R to S. The resulting diol is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide: Similarly, anti-attack by water leads to the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   Structure: CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃ (propyl groups are *cis* to each other).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   This is again a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: a *cis*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a *meso* compound (if the structure is symmetrical).\n    *   The (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry. The addition of oxygen from either the top or bottom face results in the same, single product: the *cis*-epoxide, which is meso-(4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Epoxide opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).**\n    *   This is an *anti*-addition, making the overall process an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: a reaction pathway that involves an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a racemic mixture. The mnemonic \"Cis-Anti-Racemic\" (C.A.R) applies.\n    *   Let's verify this. We start with the single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   The epoxide is protonated. Water can then attack either C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R): This inverts the configuration to S. The C5 configuration remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S): This inverts the configuration to R. The C4 configuration remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the attack is equally likely at both carbons, they are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   Compound 1 is a *meso* compound.\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are a pair of *enantiomers*.\n*   Compound 1 is a *diastereomer* of both Compound 2 and Compound 3.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral HPLC columns cannot distinguish between enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the enantiomeric pair (Compounds 2 and 3) will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like Compound 1 vs. the pair of 2 & 3) have different physical properties and will be separated by the column.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will interact differently with all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   The meso compound (1) will be separated from the chiral enantiomers (2 and 3).\n    *   The two enantiomers (2 and 3) will be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analyses.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning both new C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the double bond.\n        *   The *syn*-addition of an epoxide to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction that proceeds with backside attack, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation (*syn*-addition) followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (*anti*-opening) is stereochemically equivalent to a direct *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene produces a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol** ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). This product is achiral.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a racemic mixture.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and separate into distinct peaks. The meso-diol will be separated from the other two.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.

This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond (CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃). It is achiral.\n\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The epoxidation is a *syn-addition*, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Epoxidation:** When a symmetrical *trans*-alkene undergoes epoxidation, it forms a *trans*-epoxide. Since the attack can occur from either the top face or the bottom face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed.\n    -   (E)-oct-4-ene → (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane + (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    -   These two products are enantiomers and are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n\n4.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent is used for the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (anti) attack by a water molecule (nucleophile) on one of the epoxide carbons. This overall process results in *anti-dihydroxylation* of the original alkene.\n\n5.  **Stereochemistry of Ring Opening:** We need to consider the ring opening for both enantiomers of the epoxide.\n    -   **For (4R,5R)-epoxide:** Water can attack C4 or C5.\n        -   Attack at C4: Inverts the configuration at C4 from R to S. The configuration at C5 remains R. Product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        -   Attack at C5: Inverts the configuration at C5 from R to S. The configuration at C4 remains R. Product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        Note that (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same compound. This compound has a plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion) and is a *meso* compound.\n    -   **For (4S,5S)-epoxide:**\n        -   Attack at C4: Inverts C4 from S to R. C5 remains S. Product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the same meso compound).\n        -   Attack at C5: Inverts C5 from S to R. C4 remains S. Product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (the same meso compound).\n\n6.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The only product from Reaction 1 is the single meso compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn-addition* epoxidation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Epoxidation:** When a symmetrical *cis*-alkene undergoes epoxidation, it forms a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting material is symmetrical, the resulting epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is a *meso* compound.\n    -   (Z)-oct-4-ene → meso-(4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n4.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs an *anti*-dihydroxylation via backside attack of water.\n\n5.  **Stereochemistry of Ring Opening:** We start with the single meso-epoxide.\n    -   **For meso-(4R,5S)-epoxide:** Water can attack C4 or C5. These two attacks are equally likely.\n        -   Attack at C4 (which has R configuration): Inverts the configuration at C4 from R to S. C5 remains S. Product: **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        -   Attack at C5 (which has S configuration): Inverts the configuration at C5 from S to R. C4 remains R. Product: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    -   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the two pathways of attack are equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n6.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the stereochemical relationships:\n-   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n-   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    -   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    -   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    -   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n    -   Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    -   The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    -   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    -   It can also separate diastereomers.\n    -   Since all three stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct in a chiral environment, they will all be separated from one another (assuming ideal resolution).\n    -   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it has a C2 axis of rotation perpendicular to the double bond and passing through its center.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction, adding an oxygen atom across the double bond. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent is used for the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism where water acts as a nucleophile, resulting in *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on an (E)-alkene. A general rule in stereochemistry states that the anti-addition to an (E)-alkene results in a meso compound, provided the substituents on the double bond are identical, which they are in this case (propyl groups).\n    *   Let's trace it: (E)-oct-4-ene -> (racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane) -> hydrolysis of either enantiomer of the epoxide leads to the same single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound is achiral and has the configuration (4R,5S) or (4S,5R), which are identical.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule as it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** *Anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a (Z)-alkene. The stereochemistry rule for this is that the anti-addition to a (Z)-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace it: (Z)-oct-4-ene -> (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane) -> acid-catalyzed opening of the meso-epoxide results in a 50/50 mixture of the two possible enantiomeric products.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These are two distinct chiral compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three compounds have the following relationship:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) diol and the (4S,5S) diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nNow we predict how this three-component mixture will behave on the two different HPLC columns.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated by the column. Thus, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: A single, combined peak for the enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, a chiral column can separate diastereomers *and* enantiomers (given the problem states resolution is as high as theoretically possible).\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **three peaks**, one for each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n          H       CH2CH2CH3\n           \\     /\n            C = C\n           /     \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process.\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent opens the epoxide ring. The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide is an *anti*-addition, where the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide C-O bond.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-established stereochemical rule for this type of reaction: the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   *Mnemonic: T-A-M (Trans + Anti -> Meso)*\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains chiral centers but has a plane of symmetry. Let's call this **Product A**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n    CH3CH2CH2\\     /CH2CH2CH3\n              C = C\n             /     \\\n            H       H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is the formation of a *racemic* mixture.\n    *   *Mnemonic: C-A-R (Cis + Anti -> Racemic)*\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two enantiomers. Let's call this mixture **Product B**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationship between these isomers:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of (4R,5R)-diol.\n*   The meso-diol is also a **diastereomer** of (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on a Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\n*   **Principle:** A standard, achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated; they elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Application:**\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties. Thus, it will be separated from them.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation. It can also separate diastereomers. Therefore, a chiral column can separate all stereoisomers in a mixture.\n*   **Application:** The chiral column will separate the three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    (Note: The order of elution depends on the specific column and conditions.)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Standard (achiral) HPLC: **2 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **3 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and how the resulting mixture of products would be analyzed by different types of chromatography.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n    *   When a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, the resulting epoxide is also *trans*.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack of mCPBA can occur from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability. This results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide to form a diol. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition. A water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond, causing an inversion of configuration at the center that is attacked.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides.\n    *   For the (4R,5R)-epoxide, attack by H₂O at C4 (inverting it to S) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 (inverting it to S) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. It is a *meso* compound.\n    *   The same *meso* compound is formed from the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a single product: the *meso*-compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA useful mnemonic for dihydroxylation reactions is that **anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a meso product.**\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom to the *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is symmetric, epoxidation from either face yields the same single product: (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This epoxide is a *meso* compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The *anti*-addition (ring-opening) of the *meso*-epoxide is next.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is, say, R) inverts its configuration to S, while C5 remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reagent and an achiral (meso) intermediate, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nAnother useful mnemonic is that **anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture.**\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the *meso* compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   The *meso* compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe mixture of these three stereoisomers is run on two different HPLC columns.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical and chemical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and be separated. The *meso* compound will separate from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the *meso* compound, and one for the unresolved racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The *meso* compound is a diastereomer to the other two and will also have a unique retention time, eluting as its own peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the *meso* compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene.

It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagents:**\n    *   **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent opens the epoxide ring. This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, which proceeds via *anti*-attack of a water molecule.\n\n3.  **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening) results in an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** We can use the mnemonic \"TAME\" (Trans + Anti -> Meso).\n    *   Starting with a **T**rans alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **A**nti-addition (anti-dihydroxylation).\n    *   The product will be a **M**eso compound.\n    *   The product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. A meso compound is achiral but has chiral centers. In this case, the stereoisomer is (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which is identical to (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We can use the mnemonic \"CARS\" (Cis + Anti -> Racemic).\n    *   Starting with a **C**is alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **A**nti-addition (anti-dihydroxylation).\n    *   The product will be a **R**acemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The products of Reaction 2 are **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These are two distinct chiral molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). Let's call them **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **R**: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **S**: (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of both **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like M vs. R, and M vs. S) have different physical properties and will have different retention times. They will be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like R and S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will have the same retention time and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: Compound **M** (the meso-diol)\n        *   Peak 2: Compounds **R** and **S** co-eluting (the racemic pair)\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. It can differentiate between enantiomers by forming transient diastereomeric complexes that have different stabilities.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomers **R** and **S**.\n    *   It will also separate the diastereomer **M** from both **R** and **S**.\n    *   The problem states that the resolution is as high as theoretically possible, meaning all separable compounds will be resolved into distinct peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: Compound **M**\n        *   Peak 2: Compound **R**\n        *   Peak 3: Compound **S**\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process.\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The sequence of a *syn*-epoxidation followed by an *anti*-ring opening results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** There is a well-established rule for the stereochemical outcome of anti-addition to alkenes:\n    *   **An (E)-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a meso product.**\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** Applying this rule, the anti-dihydroxylation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains chiral centers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, meaning the overall transformation is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We apply the corresponding stereochemical rule for (Z)-alkenes:\n    *   **A (Z)-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** Applying this rule, the anti-dihydroxylation of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This product consists of two different molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Characterize the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe product mixture is analyzed on two different HPLC columns.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This type of column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the achiral column will separate the meso-diol from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Observation:** One peak for the meso-diol and one peak for the co-eluting (4R,5R) and (4S,S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This type of column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It will separate the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,S)-diol into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will also be separated and appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Observation:** One peak for the (4R,5R)-diol, a second peak for the (4S,S)-diol, and a third peak for the meso-diol.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A. Let me re-check my final option mapping.\nStandard HPLC: 2 peaks\nChiral HPLC: 3 peaks\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nA) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC -> Incorrect.\nB) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC -> Incorrect.\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC -> Correct.\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC -> Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the resulting products using two different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide is an **anti-addition**, where the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide ring, leading to the formation of a diol.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring-opening) results in a net **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:**\n    We are performing an anti-addition on a trans-alkene. A well-known stereochemical rule (often remembered by the mnemonic \"TAM\": Trans-Anti-Meso) states that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a **meso compound**.\n\n    *Let's verify this mechanistically:*\n    1.  Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) gives a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of this racemic mixture:\n        *   The (4R,5R)-epoxide undergoes backside attack by water. Attack at C4 (inverting its configuration from R to S) yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The (4S,5S)-epoxide undergoes backside attack by water. Attack at C4 (inverting its configuration from S to R) yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    3.  The products are (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. For a molecule like octane-4,5-diol where the substituents on the two stereocenters (C4 and C5) are identical (H, OH, propyl), the (R,S) and (S,R) forms are the same achiral molecule—a meso compound. This is because it possesses a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also a net **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n    We are performing an anti-addition on a cis-alkene. The stereochemical rule (mnemonic \"CAR\": Cis-Anti-Racemic) states that the anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n\n    *Let's verify this mechanistically:*\n    1.  Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) gives a cis-epoxide. The cis-epoxide has a plane of symmetry, so it is a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of this meso-epoxide:\n        *   The starting epoxide is symmetric. Attack by water can occur at C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. This forms **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. This forms **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    3.  The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images—they are a pair of enantiomers. Since both pathways are equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these compounds are:\n*   Compound 1 is achiral (meso).\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are a pair of enantiomers.\n*   Compound 1 is a diastereomer of compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like compound 1 and the pair 2/3) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   Therefore, the achiral HPLC will show two peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Total: 2 peaks**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair (compounds 2 and 3) into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound (compound 1), being a diastereomer to the other two, will also be separated from them. As an achiral compound, it will produce a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show three peaks, one for each unique compound in the mixture:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Total: 3 peaks**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     H\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent is used for epoxidation. The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid is a **syn-addition**, meaning both C-O bonds form on the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent is used for the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via an **anti-addition** mechanism, where the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-hydrolysis) results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:**\n    There's a well-established stereochemical rule for this type of reaction:\n    *   **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**\n\n    Let's verify this: The anti-addition of two -OH groups to a trans-alkene creates two chiral centers. For (E)-oct-4-ene, this process yields **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a single, achiral compound.\n\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** One compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used: mCPBA followed by H3O+. This is again an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n    The stereochemical rule for this case is:\n    *   **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**\n\n    Let's verify this: The anti-addition of two -OH groups to a cis-alkene also creates two chiral centers. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, this process yields a mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the chiral products must be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n\n    *   **Products of Reaction 2:** Two compounds that are enantiomers of each other (a racemic pair).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   meso-diol and (4R,5R)-diol are **diastereomers**.\n*   meso-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are also **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of peaks observed on two types of HPLC columns, assuming perfect resolution.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral stationary phase interacts identically with enantiomers. Therefore, it **cannot** separate them. The racemic pair of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will have the same retention time and elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties (like polarity, shape, etc.) and will interact differently with the stationary phase. Therefore, an achiral column **can** separate diastereomers. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the (R,R)/(S,S) pair, so it will have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment. It interacts differently with enantiomers, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different energies. Therefore, a chiral column **can** separate enantiomers. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   Since a chiral column can also separate diastereomers, the meso-diol will also be separated from the other two isomers. As the meso compound is achiral, it will give only one peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture. It will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-diol, and one for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence**\n\nThe reaction sequence involves two steps applied to two different starting materials:\n1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This is a classic method for creating an epoxide from an alkene. The key stereochemical feature of this reaction is that it is a **syn addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (cis or trans) dictates the stereochemistry of the resulting epoxide.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reaction opens the epoxide to form a diol (a compound with two hydroxyl groups). The key stereochemical feature here is that it is an **anti-addition**. The incoming nucleophile (H₂O) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond, leading to an inversion of configuration at the center that is attacked.\n\nThis two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a standard method for the **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the product(s) of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a meso compound (if the alkene is symmetrically substituted, which it is).\n*   **Let's verify this step-by-step:**\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA (syn addition) → This forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Acid-catalyzed opening of this racemic mixture (anti-addition):\n        *   Opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide gives (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also gives (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Product Analysis:** The products are (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. A compound with two chiral centers bearing identical substituents is a meso compound if the configurations are opposite (R,S or S,R). Therefore, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is a meso compound. The (4S,5R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** A single product is formed: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the product(s) of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers (if the alkene is symmetrically substituted).\n*   **Let's verify this step-by-step:**\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA (syn addition) → This forms a cis-epoxide. Since the starting material is a symmetrical cis-alkene, the resulting epoxide is a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane (which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry).\n    *   Acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide (anti-addition):\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Product Analysis:** The products are (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed in equal amounts from an achiral starting material, the product is a racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Two products are formed, which constitute a **racemic mixture of (4R,4R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different molecules (stereoisomers):\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these stereoisomers is:\n*   (2) and (3) are **enantiomers**.\n*   (1) is a **diastereomer** of both (2) and (3).\n\n**Step 5: Predict the HPLC chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different polarity and will elute at a different time.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The **enantiomers** (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a different retention time and will appear as its own separate peak.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,4R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral and symmetrically substituted (a propyl group on each side of the double bond).\n    ```\n        H       CH2CH2CH3\n         \\     /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n        *   Reacting a trans-alkene with a syn-addition reagent results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides.\n        *   The attack of mCPBA can happen from the top face or the bottom face of the planar alkene with equal probability.\n        *   This produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-dipropyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-dipropyloxirane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via a backside attack by a water molecule (SN2-type mechanism), resulting in an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:**\n    *   We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *trans*-alkene.\n    *   A useful mnemonic for stereochemistry is: **trans + anti = meso**.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers because it possesses an internal element of symmetry (like a plane or center of inversion).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral and symmetrically substituted.\n    ```\n        H           H\n         \\         /\n          C = C\n         /         \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n    *   We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The corresponding mnemonic is: **cis + anti = racemic**.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture, which is a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound, let's call it **M**) from Reaction 1.\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer, let's call it **E1**) from Reaction 2.\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer, let's call it **E2**) from Reaction 2.\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a diastereomer of **E2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe combined mixture of M, E1, and E2 is analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral columns separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like M and the E1/E2 pair) have different physical properties. They will interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** We will observe two peaks.\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (M).\n        *   Peak 2: The unresolved racemic mixture of enantiomers (E1 + E2).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   In a chiral environment, **enantiomers** (E1 and E2) interact differently with the stationary phase (forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities). This allows for their separation into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The **meso compound** (M), being a diastereomer of E1 and E2, will also have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** All three stereoisomers will be resolved. We will observe three peaks.\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (M).\n        *   Peak 2: One enantiomer (E1).\n        *   Peak 3: The other enantiomer (E2).\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is a symmetrical molecule, so it is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   The syn-addition to a trans-alkene results in a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation can occur from either the top face or the bottom face of the double bond with equal probability.\n    *   Attacking from one face produces one enantiomer of the epoxide, and attacking from the other face produces the other enantiomer.\n    *   The product of this step is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen followed by a backside (anti) attack by a water molecule (Sₙ2-like). This process results in an anti-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n    *   We have a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide, and we are performing an anti-addition of two -OH groups.\n    *   Let's consider the stereochemical outcome. The overall transformation is an anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene. A common rule in stereochemistry is: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound** (if the product molecule has a plane of symmetry).\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide via anti-attack by water leads to inversion at one of the carbons. For example, attack at C4 inverts its configuration from R to S, while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide via anti-attack by water leads to inversion at one carbon. For example, attack at C4 inverts its configuration from S to R, while C5 remains S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The compounds (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has two stereocenters but also has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is a symmetrical molecule and is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** Again, this is a syn-addition.\n    *   Syn-addition to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide (also called a meso-epoxide in this case).\n    *   The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. Only one epoxide product is formed.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   We are starting with a cis-alkene and performing an overall anti-dihydroxylation. The stereochemistry rule is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the opening of the meso-epoxide.\n        *   The meso-epoxide is attacked by water from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (anti-attack).\n        *   Attack at C4 (let's say it's R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   Since attack at C4 and C5 is equally probable, a 50:50 mixture of the two products is formed.\n    *   The products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical species:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules are all stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol.\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) forms are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso form is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) forms.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute), appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the meso-diol from the chiral diols (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   The column will also separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+).\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA results in the formation of an epoxide via a *syn*-addition mechanism (the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These are a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The epoxide is then opened by nucleophilic attack of water under acidic conditions. This reaction proceeds via an *anti*-addition mechanism (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen). This two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n    *   According to the rules of stereochemistry, an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound (when the substituents on the double bond are identical, as they are here with two propyl groups).\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the products from Step 1a:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide (an enantiomer) via *anti*-attack by water gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide (the other enantiomer) via *anti*-attack by water also gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is the same as (4S,5R)-diol).\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is a *meso* compound because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the *meso* compound, **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single chemical compound.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+). This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction.\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation.**\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene.

This is a single achiral, meso compound.\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   Again, this is an *anti*-addition mechanism. According to the rules of stereochemistry, an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the product from Step 2a:\n        *   The *meso* epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, has two enantiotopic carbon atoms (C4 and C5).\n        *   *Anti*-attack by water at C4 (the R center) will invert its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   *Anti*-attack by water at C5 (the S center) will invert its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers and are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.

This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a center of inversion.\n    ```\n       H      C3H7\n        \\    /\n         C==C\n        /    \\\n      C3H7    H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **trans-alkene + syn-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. Let's call them E(R,R) and E(S,S).\n\n*   **Step 1b: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H3O+).** The acid protonates the epoxide's oxygen, making it a good leaving group. Water then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the epoxide ring. This nucleophilic attack occurs with an inversion of configuration at the site of attack (SN2-like mechanism). This is an **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl groups across the original double bond.\n    *   Let's analyze the ring-opening for each enantiomeric epoxide:\n        *   **For the (4R,5R)-epoxide (E(R,R))**:\n            *   Water attacks C4: Inversion at C4 (R → S). The configuration becomes (4S, 5R).\n            *   Water attacks C5: Inversion at C5 (R → S). The configuration becomes (4R, 5S).\n            *   (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are designations for the same **meso** compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n        *   **For the (4S,5S)-epoxide (E(S,S))**:\n            *   Water attacks C4: Inversion at C4 (S → R). The configuration becomes (4R, 5S).\n            *   Water attacks C5: Inversion at C5 (S → R). The configuration becomes (4S, 5R).\n            *   Again, both attacks lead to the same **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Therefore, the final product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n       H      H\n        \\    /\n         C==C\n        /    \\\n      C3H7  C3H7\n    ```\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA (syn-addition).**\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **cis-alkene + syn-addition → meso compound**.\n    *   The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a single, achiral meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H3O+) (anti-addition).**\n    *   We start with the single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The two carbons (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic.\n    *   Water attacks the protonated epoxide:\n        *   Attack at C4 (which has S configuration): Inversion at C4 (S → R). The product configuration is (4R, 5R).\n        *   Attack at C5 (which has R configuration): Inversion at C5 (R → S). The product configuration is (4S, 5S).\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since attack at either enantiotopic carbon is equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts, resulting in a **racemic mixture**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNote that the meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.

This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 C=C\n               H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The epoxidation is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A *trans*-alkene will yield a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the reaction must produce an achiral product or a racemic mixture of chiral products. Attacking the planar alkene from the top face or the bottom face results in two different products that are mirror images of each other. These are the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers of 4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Product of epoxidation: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by water on the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen (an Sₙ2-like backside attack), resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two -OH groups.\n\n4.  **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *trans*-alkene. There is a useful mnemonic for this: \"**T**rans-**A**nti-**M**eso\" (TAM). When the alkene is symmetrically substituted (as oct-4-ene is), a *trans*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide via backside attack by water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has two stereocenters but also has a center of inversion, making it a *meso* compound and therefore achiral.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 C=C\n               H     H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene yields a *cis*-epoxide. In this case, the product is cis-4,5-epoxyoctane. This epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is a *meso* compound.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs the same *anti*-dihydroxylation as in Reaction 1.\n\n4.  **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *cis*-alkene. The mnemonic here is \"**C**is-**A**nti-**E**nantiomers\" (CAE). A symmetrically substituted *cis*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the *meso*-epoxide (let's say it's 4R,5S) via backside attack.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) causes inversion, resulting in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) causes inversion, resulting in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\nNow, let's predict the chromatograms:\n\n**A) Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for the meso-diol.\n    *   One peak for the co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   **Total Peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   Diastereomers will also be separated.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for the meso-diol (it is a diastereomer to the other two).\n    *   One peak for the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   One peak for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   **Total Peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical about the double bond. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction proceeds in two steps:\n    1.  Treatment with one equivalent of mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid). This is a standard epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, a *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. A nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an S_N2-like fashion, which means it attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** A *syn*-addition (epoxidation) followed by an *anti*-addition (hydrolysis) results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-(E)-alkene produces a *meso*-compound (if the resulting molecule has the potential for a plane of symmetry, which octan-4,5-diol does).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, the achiral meso-compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. Like its E-isomer, it is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this case is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-(Z)-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore *cannot* be separated. They will elute from the column at the exact same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomeric pair of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   The result is a total of **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer.\n    *   As a result, a chiral column can separate enantiomers from each other. It can also, of course, separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   The chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   **Peak 3:** The (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   The result is a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC column and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC column. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this stereochemistry problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2   H\n           \\  /\n            C==C\n           /  \\\n          H   CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   The *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is symmetric and achiral, the epoxidation reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction where a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the oxygen bridge. This is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A key rule in stereochemistry is: **_anti_-addition to a _trans_-alkene yields a meso compound.**\n    *   Let's verify this. The (4R,5R)-epoxide will be attacked by water, inverting the configuration at one carbon (e.g., C4), leading to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The (4S,5S)-epoxide will similarly lead to (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are different names for the *same* achiral meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene.

This is again an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding rule in stereochemistry is: **_anti_-addition to a _cis_-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   First, the *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene forms the *cis*-epoxide (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane), which is a single achiral, meso compound.\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two equivalent carbons (C4 or C5).\n        *   Attack at C4 leads to one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 leads to the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting epoxide is achiral, the two pathways are equally probable, resulting in a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Products of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these compounds is as follows:\n*   Compound 1 (meso) is a **diastereomer** of Compound 2 ((R,R)).\n*   Compound 1 (meso) is also a **diastereomer** of Compound 3 ((S,S)).\n*   Compound 2 ((R,R)) and Compound 3 ((S,S)) are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like compound 1 vs. the 2/3 pair) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   Therefore, the achiral HPLC will show two peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (R,R)- and (S,S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Total: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomers (compounds 2 and 3) into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the meso compound (compound 1) from the other two, as it is their diastereomer.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique molecules in the mixture.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Total: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks observed in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule due to a center of inversion.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1) epoxidation with mCPBA, followed by 2) acid-catalyzed ring-opening (hydrolysis). This sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the double bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry Principle:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene that is symmetrically substituted results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   `trans-alkene + anti-addition -> meso product`\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound. Let's call it **Meso-diol**.\n    ```\n        HO   H\n          \\  |\n           C--C--OH\n          /  |\n    Pr---H   ---Pr   (showing one possible conformation)\n    ```\n    This molecule has two stereocenters, (4R, 5S), and possesses a center of inversion, making it achiral.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule due to a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is the same: anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemistry Principle:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene that is symmetrically substituted results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   `cis-alkene + anti-addition -> racemic product`\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). They are produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture. Let's call them **(R,R)-diol** and **(S,S)-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(R,R)-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(S,S)-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the stereochemical relationships between these three compounds:\n*   **(R,R)-diol** and **(S,S)-diol** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **Meso-diol** is a **diastereomer** of both (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe product mixture is analyzed on two different HPLC columns.\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   This separation technique relies on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, such as (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers**, such as the Meso-diol and the (R,R)/(S,S) pair, have different physical properties. They will be separated and elute at different times, appearing as **distinct peaks**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** We will observe two peaks. One peak for the Meso-diol and another peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair ((R,R)-diol + (S,S)-diol).\n*   **Total Peaks = 2**\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase which creates a chiral environment.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, forming temporary diastereomeric complexes with different stabilities. This allows for the separation of **enantiomers**. Therefore, (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   Diastereomers are also separated by chiral HPLC (as they are by achiral HPLC). Thus, the Meso-diol will elute at a different time from both the (R,R)-diol and the (S,S)-diol.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** All three stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks = 3**\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks observed in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, followed by H₃O⁺**\n\nThis reaction sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the starting alkene. We need to determine the stereochemistry of the product, octane-4,5-diol.\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** The two-step process of epoxidation with mCPBA (a *syn*-addition) followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening (an S_N2-like *anti*-attack) results in an overall *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the double bond.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** A useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions is **\"TAM\"**, which stands for **T**rans-**A**nti-**M**eso. This means that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound is an achiral molecule that contains chiral centers. For octane-4,5-diol, the meso form is (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral product.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, followed by H₃O⁺**\n\nThis is also an anti-dihydroxylation reaction.\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is also an *anti*-addition of two -OH groups.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The mnemonic for this case is **\"CAR\"**, which stands for **C**is-**A**nti-**R**acemic. This means that the anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture.\n    *   A racemic mixture consists of a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers. For octane-4,5-diol, the enantiomers are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This constitutes two different chemical compounds.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (the meso isomer) is a **diastereomer** of compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe product mixture is analyzed on two types of HPLC columns.\n\n#### **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus can be separated on a standard achiral column.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the reactions and the subsequent HPLC analysis.\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene which is achiral. The structure is CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃, with the two propyl groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the two new C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the original double bond.\n    *   Since (E)-oct-4-ene is planar, the mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from the top face and attack from the bottom face produce non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n    *   Therefore, the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Step 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺) Treatment.** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sₙ2-style) attack by a water molecule on one of the epoxide carbons. This results in an **anti-addition** of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original C-C bond of the epoxide.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of one of the enantiomers, say (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 4 (which has R configuration) leads to inversion of stereochemistry at that carbon, resulting in an S configuration. The configuration at carbon 5 (R) remains unchanged. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 5 (which has R configuration) leads to inversion at C5, resulting in an S configuration. The configuration at carbon 4 (R) remains unchanged. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The products (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a **meso compound**.\n    *   Performing the same analysis on the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, also yields the same meso-diol.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is the single, achiral **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene which is achiral. The two propyl groups are on the same side of the double bond.\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA (syn-addition).**\n    *   When (Z)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, the resulting epoxide will have the two propyl groups on the same side of the ring (a cis-epoxide).\n    *   This cis-epoxide has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C4-C5 bond and passing through the oxygen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a single **meso compound**: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Step 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺) Treatment (anti-addition).**\n    *   We now perform an acid-catalyzed ring-opening on the meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The two carbons (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic, meaning attack at either carbon is equally likely.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 4 (R configuration) causes inversion, leading to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 5 (S configuration) causes inversion, leading to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the attack is equally probable at both sites, they are formed in equal amounts.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNote that the meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Part 4: HPLC Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC separates molecules based on physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In our mixture, the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diol) will co-elute as one peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair, will have different properties and will elute as a separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different energies and stabilities.\n    *   Since chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers, it can certainly also separate diastereomers.\n    *   It will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-diol, and one for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs an epoxidation on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. The epoxidation of a trans-alkene produces a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. For (E)-oct-4-ene, this yields a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on one of the protonated epoxide carbons. This attack occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl groups relative to each other.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is a method for *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A key principle in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (if the substituents allow for a plane of symmetry, which they do here since the alkene is symmetrical).\n    *   Let's follow the intermediates: The racemic mixture of epoxides ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) reacts with water.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide at either C4 or C5 leads to inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon, producing the (4S,5R)-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide at either C4 or C5 produces the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   The (4R,5S)-diol and (4S,5R)-diol are the same molecule: meso-octane-4,5-diol, which is an achiral compound with an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is the formation of a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's follow the intermediates: The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene forms a *meso*-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   Acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide involves water attacking either C4 or C5.\n    *   Attack at C4 (an R center) inverts it to S, yielding the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (an S center) inverts it to R, yielding the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus will have different retention times and appear as separate peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show one peak for the meso-diol and a second, single peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) + (4S,5S)).\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   In this chiral environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times. Thus, enantiomers can be separated.\n    *   Diastereomers will also be separated.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene which is achiral. The two groups attached to the double bond are identical (n-propyl groups).\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn-addition*, meaning both C-O bonds form on the same face of the alkene. For a trans-alkene, this results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the product will be a racemic mixture of the two possible chiral trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the backside (anti-attack relative to the epoxide oxygen). This is an *anti-addition* step.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation (syn) followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti) results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** A well-known rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene (with identical substituents) results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's trace it:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O → Backside attack at either C4 or C5 inverts the configuration at that carbon, leading to (4S,5R)-diol or (4R,5S)-diol. Both designations refer to the same single meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O → Backside attack leads to the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The stereochemical rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene (with identical substituents) is the formation of a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace it:\n        *   (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA (syn-addition) → This forms the *cis*-epoxide, which is a meso compound (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   meso-epoxide + H₃O⁺ (anti-addition) → Backside attack by water on the two equivalent carbons of the meso-epoxide leads to the formation of two different products which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n    *   The products are **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**, formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1) - Achiral\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2) - Chiral\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2) - Chiral\n\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus different affinities for the stationary phase.

This is a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom to the double bond is a **syn-addition**. When a trans-alkene undergoes syn-addition, it forms a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides. In this case, it produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the oxygen bridge. This is an **anti-attack**, which inverts the stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction, epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, is an **anti-dihydroxylation**. A general rule in stereochemistry is that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   Let's trace it:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to S) or C5 (inverting it to S). Both attacks lead to the same product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, which is a meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to R) or C5 (inverting it to R). Both attacks also lead to the same meso product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺), meaning this is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace it:\n        *   First, the syn-addition (epoxidation) to the cis-alkene forms a single meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Then, the anti-attack (hydrolysis) on this meso epoxide occurs:\n            *   Attack at the C4 (R-center) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack at the C5 (S-center) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   Compound 2 and Compound 3 are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   Compound 1 is a **diastereomer** of Compound 2 (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n*   Compound 1 is also a **diastereomer** of Compound 3.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   Standard HPLC columns are achiral. They separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like compound 1 and the pair 2/3) have different physical properties. They will interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated into **different peaks**.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show two peaks: one for the meso compound and a second for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Total Peaks = 2.**\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer.\n*   **Enantiomers** will have different affinities for the chiral stationary phase and will be separated into **two distinct peaks**. So, compound 2 and compound 3 will be resolved.\n*   The **meso compound** (compound 1) is a diastereomer to both enantiomers and will also have a different retention time. It will appear as its own separate peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers.\n*   **Total Peaks = 3.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and a subsequent understanding of how the resulting mixture of isomers will be analyzed by both achiral and chiral chromatography.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2      H\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. The addition of the oxygen atom is a *syn*-addition, meaning it adds to the same face of the double bond. The epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack from the top face and bottom face are equally likely, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent opens the epoxide ring via an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside attack of a water molecule (nucleophile) on one of the epoxide carbons. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening) is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso*-compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide via backside attack at either C4 or C5 results in the (4R,5S)-diol, which is a *meso*-compound due to an internal center of symmetry. Opening its enantiomer, the (4S,5S)-epoxide, also yields the same (4R,5S)-meso-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the achiral **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2      CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H3O+). This is again an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify: Epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene produces a *cis*-epoxide, which is a *meso*-compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). The subsequent *anti*-addition (ring-opening) to this *meso*-epoxide will produce two enantiomers. Attack at C4 (let's say it's R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol, while attack at C5 (S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. These two products are enantiomers and are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity) in an achiral environment.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair. It will appear as a **separate peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own **third peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze the Reactions**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the stereochemical outcome of the two-step reaction sequence applied to two different starting materials. The reaction sequence is:\n1.  Epoxidation with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).\n2.  Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide with water (H3O+).\n\nThis overall process results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to the opposite faces of the original double bond.\n\nA helpful mnemonic for the stereochemistry of such additions is:\n*   **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition → **R**acemic mixture (enantiomers)\n*   **T**rans-alkene + **A**nti-addition → **M**eso compound\n\nLet's apply this to each reaction.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. The structure is symmetric, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** As established, this is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n3.  **Applying the Rule (T + A → M):** A *trans*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a *meso* compound.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is *meso*-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule, even though it has chiral centers. Let's label this product **M**. Specifically, it is the (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which is identical to (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n3.  **Applying the Rule (C + A → R):** A *cis*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a *racemic* mixture of enantiomers.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers of octane-4,5-diol: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's label these enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n\n*   **M**: The meso-diol from Reaction 1.\n*   **E1**: One enantiomer of the diol from Reaction 2, e.g., (4R, 5R).\n*   **E2**: The other enantiomer from Reaction 2, e.g., (4S, 5S).\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a diastereomer of **E2**.\n\n### **Part 3: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe final step is to predict how this mixture of three compounds will behave on the two different HPLC columns.\n\n**A) Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity and size. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Diastereomers (**M** vs. **E1**/**E2**) have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (**E1** vs. **E2**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: The meso compound **M**.\n    *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with the two enantiomers of a chiral molecule. It can separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The column will separate the diastereomers (**M** from **E1**/**E2**).\n    *   Crucially, the chiral column will also separate the enantiomers **E1** and **E2** from each other.\n*   **Observation:** All three stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: The meso compound **M**.\n    *   Peak 2: Enantiomer **E1**.\n    *   Peak 3: Enantiomer **E2**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene and is symmetrical about the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation overall.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene. There's a useful mnemonic for predicting the stereochemistry of such reactions: **\"Trans-Anti-Meso\"**.\n    *   Starting with a **trans**-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **anti**-addition (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed opening).\n    *   On a symmetrical alkene, this yields a **meso** compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is a single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral but contains stereocenters.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene and is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), leading to an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** We can use another mnemonic: **\"Cis-Anti-Racemic\"**.\n    *   Starting with a **cis**-alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **anti**-addition.\n    *   This yields a **racemic** mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso compound (4R,5S) is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   However, it *can* separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n    *   Therefore, the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diol) will co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n    *   The meso diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will elute at a different time and produce a separate peak.\n    *   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed on the standard HPLC.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer of a racemic pair.\n    *   It will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is also a unique chemical entity (a diastereomer to the others) and will produce its own, third peak.\n    *   **Result:** **3 peaks** will be observed on the chiral HPLC.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of two stereospecific reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation of the resulting product mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        Pr      H\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n        H      Pr   (Pr = propyl, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn-addition* across the double bond. The oxygen atom adds to both carbons from the same face of the alkene.\n    *   Because the starting alkene is planar, the mCPBA can attack from the \"top\" face or the \"bottom\" face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from the top and bottom faces of the trans-alkene produces two different stereoisomers of the epoxide, which are enantiomers to each other.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   So, the first step produces a **racemic mixture** of epoxides.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sɴ2-type) attack by a water molecule on one of the carbon atoms of the ring. This is an *anti-addition* of the two hydroxyl groups (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water molecule).\n    *   The overall reaction (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed opening) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   A useful stereochemistry rule is: **anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a meso compound.**\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide by backside attack of water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide by backside attack of water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (S → R), while C5 remains S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) designations describe the exact same molecule. This molecule has two chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a center of inversion, making it a **meso compound**.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        Pr      Pr\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n        H      H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn-addition* of oxygen to the cis-alkene can happen from the top or bottom face. However, due to the symmetry of the cis-alkene, both modes of attack produce the same, single achiral epoxide. This product is a **meso epoxide**, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of this meso-epoxide will occur.\n    *   The overall reaction is again *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: **anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   The starting epoxide is the meso compound (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Backside attack by water at C4 (which is R) will invert it to S. The configuration at C5 remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Backside attack by water at C5 (which is S) will invert it to R. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   (4S,5S) and (4R,5R) are non-superimposable mirror images, i.e., they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the attack at C4 and C5 is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-diol** ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2).\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The Meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by achiral HPLC and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will form one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral HPLC. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Thus, it will have a different retention time.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   It will separate the two **enantiomers**, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the **meso-diol** from the two chiral diols, as it is a diastereomer and will have a different interaction with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans* alkene. It is achiral.\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** mCPBA adds an oxygen atom across the double bond in a *syn* fashion (both C-O bonds form on the same face of the alkene). This reaction converts (E)-oct-4-ene into *trans*-4,5-epoxyoctane. Because the starting material is symmetrical, attack from either face yields the same single, achiral (meso) epoxide.\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** Aqueous acid protonates the epoxide, and water attacks as a nucleophile. This ring-opening is an Sₙ2-type reaction that proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. This overall process is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition of a reagent to a *trans* (E) alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol.

It is also achiral.\n    *   **Step 1 & 2:** The reaction sequence is the same as in Reaction 1, resulting in an overall *anti*-addition of two -OH groups.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding stereochemical rule states that the *anti*-addition of a reagent to a *cis* (Z) alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix) of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are two distinct chiral molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n        3.

It will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\nThe analysis concludes that the product mixture will produce:\n*   **2 peaks** in standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the principles of chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the product of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   When a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene will form a 1:1 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Let's call this racemic epoxide mixture **E-Epoxide**.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid. This is a ring-opening reaction where water acts as a nucleophile. The mechanism is SN2-like, proceeding with *anti*-addition (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the epoxide's C-O bond).\n    *   Starting with the racemic **E-Epoxide** and performing an *anti*-addition leads to a meso diol.\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide by H₂O (anti-attack) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide by H₂O (anti-attack) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are actually the *same* molecule. This molecule has a center of inversion and is achiral, making it a *meso* compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*(Mnemonic: A common mnemonic for dihydroxylation is **TRAM**: **T**rans-alkene + **R**acemic intermediate (from syn-addition) -> **M**eso product (from anti-opening). Or more directly for the overall reaction: **Trans + Anti = Meso**)*\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the product of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   When a *cis*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a *meso* epoxide.\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene will form meso-4,5-epoxyoctane ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). This single product is achiral. Let's call it **Z-Epoxide**.\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The *meso* **Z-Epoxide** undergoes *anti*-addition of H₂O.\n    *   Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) of the meso-epoxide will give one enantiomer of the diol, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) will give the other enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*(Mnemonic: The counterpart to the one above is **CAR**: **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition -> **R**acemic product)*\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules have the following relationship:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.

The first step, reaction with mCPBA, is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom to form an epoxide. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring-opening by water, is an anti-addition of the second hydroxyl group. The net result is the addition of two hydroxyl groups across the double bond in an anti-fashion.\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. It is achiral as it possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n2.  **Stereochemical Rule**: The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   **Step-by-step confirmation:**\n        *   Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) with mCPBA (syn-addition) yields a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti-addition of H₂O) of this racemic mixture opens the epoxides. Let's analyze one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-epoxide:\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is R) causes an inversion of configuration, leading to an S configuration at C4. The configuration at C5 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is R) causes an inversion, leading to an S configuration at C5. The configuration at C4 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two potential products, (4R,5S)-diol and (4S,5R)-diol, are in fact the same single molecule because it is a meso compound (it has stereocenters but is achiral due to a center of inversion). The reaction of the other epoxide enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, also yields the same meso diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1**: A single product is formed, which is the meso compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (which can be named (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis is also an anti-dihydroxylation reaction.\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. It is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Stereochemical Rule**: The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   **Step-by-step confirmation:**\n        *   Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) with mCPBA (syn-addition) yields a single achiral meso epoxide: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane (which can be named (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti-addition of H₂O) of this meso-epoxide:\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is R) causes an inversion to S. The configuration at C5 (S) is unchanged. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is S) causes an inversion to R. The configuration at C4 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two products, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, are enantiomers. Since attack at the two equivalent carbons (C4 and C5) is equally likely, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2**: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call them **P** and **P'**.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **P**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **P'**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are:\n*   **P** and **P'** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of both **P** and **P'**. (For example, compare M=(4R,5S) to P=(4R,5R); they have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C4).\n\n### HPLC Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC**:\n    *   Achiral HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. Therefore, compound **M** will have a different retention time from **P** and **P'**.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, **P** and **P'** will have the exact same retention time and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for M, and one for the P/P' pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC**:\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment where enantiomers can interact differently and thus be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (**P** and **P'**) will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (**M** vs. **P** and **P'**) are also separated.\n    *   **Compound M** is achiral (meso), so it will appear as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique stereoisomers. It will show **3 peaks**: one for M, one for P, and one for P'.\n\n### Summary of Observations\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and the subsequent analysis of the product mixture using two different types of chromatography.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical around the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA, 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This two-step process results in the anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   The first step, reaction with mCPBA, is an epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. The epoxidation of a trans-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene) results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. Specifically, a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   The second step is the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water. This is an anti-addition, where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, inverting the stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups. A useful mnemonic for this type of reaction is: **\"Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound\"**.\n    *   Let's trace this: Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, acid-catalyzed attack by water at C4 leads to the (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 leads to (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since oct-4-ene is symmetrical, the resulting diol (octane-4,5-diol) has two identical substituents on the stereogenic carbons (a propyl group and a hydrogen). Therefore, the (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) configurations represent the same single, achiral **meso** compound. This compound has an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Starting with the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, will also lead to the same meso-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, the **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA, 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The first step is the epoxidation of a cis-alkene. This syn-addition yields a meso-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane (this is the cis-epoxide).\n    *   The second step is the anti-addition opening of this meso-epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The mnemonic for this case is: **\"Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture\"**.\n    *   Let's trace this: Starting with the meso-(4R,5S)-epoxide, attack by water can occur at C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n    *   Attack at C4 inverts its configuration from R to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Attack at C5 inverts its configuration from S to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   The two products, (4S,5S)-diol and (4R,5R)-diol, are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** (50:50) of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **P+** and **P-**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol)\n2.  **P+** ((4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol)\n3.  **P-** ((4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   P+ and P- are **enantiomers**.\n*   M is a **diastereomer** of both P+ and P-.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M vs. P+/P-) have different physical properties and will thus have different retention times, leading to separate peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (like P+ and P-) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the racemic pair (P+ and P-).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Since all three compounds (M, P+, and P-) are distinct stereoisomers, they will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Enantiomers P+ and P- will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The diastereomer M will also have a different retention time from both P+ and P-.\n    *   Assuming ideal resolution, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for M, one for P+, and one for P-.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. This molecule is achiral.\n    ```\n       H     CH2CH2CH3\n        \\   /\n         C=C\n        /   \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   When an achiral trans-alkene undergoes epoxidation (a syn-addition), it forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, the attack can happen from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from one face produces the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Attack from the other face produces the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, are enantiomers.\n    *   Thus, the first step produces a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction is an anti-addition. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond, inverting the stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n    *   For a trans-epoxide, anti-addition of two -OH groups results in a meso diol.\n    *   Let's trace this:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to S) or C5 (inverting it to S). Since the molecule is symmetric, either attack gives the same product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. This product is a meso compound (it has a center of inversion and is achiral).\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to R) or C5 (inverting it to R). Either attack gives the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is the same meso compound.\n    *   A useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions on symmetrical alkenes: **Trans + Anti = Meso**. The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also achiral.\n    ```\n           H           H\n            \\         /\n             C-------C\n            /         \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The syn-addition of oxygen to the cis-alkene will form a cis-epoxide.\n    *   Because the starting (Z)-alkene is achiral and symmetric, the addition of the oxygen atom from either face results in the same single product: (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is a meso compound, specifically (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs the anti-addition ring-opening.\n    *   Starting with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxyoctane), the attack by water can occur at either C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C4 inverts its configuration (R → S), while C5 remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5 inverts its configuration (S → R), while C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers. Since the attacks at C4 and C5 are equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   The mnemonic for this is: **Cis + Anti = Racemic**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   Compound 1 is a diastereomer of both compound 2 and compound 3 (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated by an achiral column. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the HPLC will show two peaks:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The meso-diol.\n    *   **Result for standard HPLC: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It can separate enantiomers.\n    *   It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 3:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Result for chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the chemical reactions.**\n\nThe reaction sequence involves two steps:\n1.  **Epoxidation:** Treatment with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). This reagent adds a single oxygen atom across the double bond to form an epoxide. This is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen adds to one face of the alkene.\n2.  **Epoxide Ring Opening:** Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a good leaving group. A water molecule then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the back side (S_N2-like). This is an **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\nThe overall transformation is an **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stereochemistry of the products for Reaction 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral, having an internal plane of symmetry, and has stereocenters with opposite configurations (e.g., R,S).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral meso compound. Let's call it compound **M**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry of the products for Reaction 2.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have opposite configurations at all stereocenters (e.g., R,R and S,S).\n*   **Products of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **RR**) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **SS**).\n\n**Step 4: Characterize the final combined mixture.**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n1.  **M**: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound)\n2.  **RR**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n3.  **SS**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nLet's examine the relationship between these stereoisomers:\n*   **RR** and **SS** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of both **RR** and **SS**. (Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**Step 5: Predict the outcome of the standard (achiral) HPLC analysis.**\n\n*   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like **RR** and **SS**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard HPLC and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like **M** vs. the **RR/SS** pair) have different physical properties. They will have different interactions with the HPLC column and will be separated into **different peaks**.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for the racemic mixture of **RR** and **SS**.\n    *   A second, distinct peak for the meso compound **M**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC: 2 peaks.**\n\n**Step 6: Predict the outcome of the chiral HPLC analysis.**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers. It separates compounds based on the different stabilities of the transient diastereomeric complexes they form with the stationary phase.\n*   **Enantiomers** (**RR** and **SS**) will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso compound **M** is a diastereomer of **RR** and **SS**. It will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute at a time different from both **RR** and **SS**, appearing as its own **single peak**. The question states the resolution is as high as theoretically possible, meaning there will be no accidental co-elution of diastereomers.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for **RR**.\n    *   A second peak for **SS**.\n    *   A third peak for **M**.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Step 7: Match the findings with the given options.**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is treated first with mCPBA and then with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This two-step sequence is a classic method for the *anti-dihydroxylation* of an alkene. The first step, epoxidation with mCPBA, is a *syn-addition*. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water, is an *anti-addition* (an Sₙ2-type attack). The net result of adding two -OH groups across the double bond is *anti*.\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** For a symmetrically substituted alkene, the stereochemical outcome follows a well-known rule: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. Undergoing anti-dihydroxylation, it will yield a single product: the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is treated with the same sequence of reagents.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also an *anti-dihydroxylation*.\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** The rule for a cis-alkene is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture of enantiomers**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. Undergoing anti-dihydroxylation, it will yield a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Characterize the Final Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three different molecules, which are all stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound, let's call it **M**).\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer, let's call it **R**).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer, let's call it **S**).\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **R**.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **S**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram for Standard (Achiral) HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, size, boiling point). The stationary phase is achiral.\n*   **Separating Stereoisomers:**\n    *   **Enantiomers (R and S)** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will interact with the achiral stationary phase in the exact same way and will have the same retention time. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers (M vs. R, and M vs. S)** have different physical properties. Therefore, the meso compound **M** will interact with the stationary phase differently than the enantiomeric pair (**R**+**S**) and will have a different retention time.\n*   **Conclusion:** The achiral HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (**M**) and one for the co-eluting enantiomers (**R**+**S**).\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram for Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the differentiation of enantiomers.\n*   **Separating Stereoisomers:**\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts with the two enantiomers (**R** and **S**) to form temporary diastereomeric complexes. Since these complexes have different energies and stabilities, the enantiomers will have different retention times and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound (**M**) is a diastereomer of **R** and **S**. As diastereomers have different physical properties, **M** will also be separated from both **R** and **S**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will be able to resolve all three stereoisomers. It will show **three peaks**: one for compound **M**, one for compound **R**, and one for compound **S**.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetric.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     H\n                 \\   /\n                  C=C\n                 /   \\\n                H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid): This is an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom is a *syn-addition*. Since the starting alkene is planar and achiral, the mCPBA can attack from either the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n        *   Attack on the trans-alkene yields a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H3O+): This causes acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide to form a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups). This ring-opening proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism, resulting in *anti-addition* of the two hydroxyl groups (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water molecule).\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti-dihydroxylation* of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The rule for anti-addition to a trans-alkene is that it produces a *meso* compound. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has stereocenters.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetric.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\   /\n                  C=C\n                 /   \\\n                H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same two-step sequence for anti-dihydroxylation is used.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The rule for anti-addition to a cis-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces two products that are enantiomers of each other: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's identify the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Separations**\n\n**A) Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical and chemical properties (like polarity, size, etc.).\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. The racemic pair of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair and will appear as a separate peak.\n*   **Conclusion for Standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the column to interact differently with the two enantiomers.\n*   Enantiomers can be separated by a chiral column because their transient interactions with the chiral stationary phase form diastereomeric complexes with different energies, leading to different retention times. Thus, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two compounds, will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute as a separate, third peak.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks (one for the meso compound, and one for each of the two enantiomers).\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and the subsequent analysis of the combined product mixture using two different types of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2      H\n                \\    /\n                 C==C\n                /    \\\n               H      CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is an epoxidation.\n    *   This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   The syn-addition to a trans-alkene results in a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, and mCPBA is treated as an achiral reagent, the epoxidation can occur from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n    *   This leads to the formation of a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   The epoxide is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This results in acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, where a water molecule opens the epoxide ring.\n    *   The mechanism is an **anti-addition** (SN2-type backside attack) of water on the protonated epoxide. The water molecule attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   So, the overall reaction sequence (epoxidation followed by acid hydrolysis) results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the original alkene.\n    *   A mnemonic for the stereochemistry is that an **E**-alkene undergoing **anti**-addition gives a **meso** product (\"**E**-**A**nti-**M**eso\").\n    *   Let's confirm this by looking at one enantiomer of the epoxide, for example, the (4R,5R) epoxide. The anti-attack of water at either C4 or C5 will lead to inversion of configuration at that center.\n        *   Attack at C4: configuration changes from R to S. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5: configuration changes from R to S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) products are the same achiral, meso compound due to a plane of symmetry. The same meso compound would be formed from the (4S,5S) epoxide.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2      CH2CH2CH3\n                \\    /\n                 C==C\n                /    \\\n               H      H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   Again, this is a **syn-addition**.\n    *   Syn-addition to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide.\n    *   The resulting cis-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane) has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**.\n    *   Unlike in Reaction 1, only one product is formed in this step.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   This is the same **anti-addition** mechanism as in Reaction 1. The overall process is **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n    *   A mnemonic for this case is that a **Z**-alkene undergoing **anti**-addition gives a **racemic** mixture (\"**Z**-**A**nti-**R**acemic\").\n    *   Let's confirm this. Starting with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S) form), the anti-attack of water occurs.\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-center): configuration inverts to S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (S-center): configuration inverts to R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   These two pathways are equally likely. The products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images; they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNow we analyze this mixture with two types of HPLC:\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns are achiral. They separate molecules based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and thus **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks:\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that interacts differently with each enantiomer.\n    *   This differential interaction allows for the **separation of enantiomers**.\n    *   It will also separate the meso compound from the chiral enantiomers, as they are diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved. The chromatogram will show three peaks:\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 3:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the reactions and the subsequent chromatographic analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Reactions\n\nThe overall process described is a two-step transformation of an alkene into a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups).\n1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** This step adds an oxygen atom across the double bond in a *syn* fashion, meaning the oxygen adds to the same face of the alkene. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (E or Z) is preserved in the resulting epoxide.\n2.  **Aqueous Acid (H3O+) Treatment:** This step performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. A water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons of the protonated epoxide ring. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, which is an *anti*-attack.\n\nThe net result of these two steps (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring opening) is the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the double bond. The two -OH groups are added to the opposite faces of the original double bond.\n\nWe can use established stereochemical rules for anti-addition to alkenes:\n\n*   **(T)rans-alkene + (A)nti-addition = (M)eso product** (if the product is capable of being meso). This is the **TAM** rule.\n*   **(C)is-alkene + (A)nti-addition = (R)acemic mixture** of enantiomers. This is the **CAR** rule.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the specific reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n\n*   Starting material: (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetric trans-alkene.\n*   Reaction: Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   Applying the **TAM** rule (Trans + Anti = Meso), the product of this reaction is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n\n*   Starting material: (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetric cis-alkene.\n*   Reaction: Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   Applying the **CAR** rule (Cis + Anti = Racemic), the product of this reaction is a **racemic mixture** of the two enantiomeric forms of octane-4,5-diol: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these three molecules:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### Step 3: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\nNow, we predict what will be observed when this three-component mixture is analyzed by two types of HPLC.\n\n**Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   This type of chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (except for their interaction with plane-polarized light or other chiral entities). Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will elute at the exact same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers**, on the other hand, have different physical properties. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, causing it to elute at a different time. It will appear as a **separate, second peak**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   This type of chromatography uses a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer in a mixture.\n*   Because of these differing interactions, the **enantiomers** ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will be separated and will elute at different times, appearing as **two distinct peaks**.\n*   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute at its own characteristic time, appearing as a **third peak**.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### Summary of Results\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the unresolved racemic pair).\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks (one for the meso compound, and one for each of the two resolved enantiomers).\n\nMatching this outcome to the given options:\nA) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the HPLC analyses:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        H       Pr\n         \\     /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n        Pr      H      (Pr = propyl, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation on the alkene. The reaction is a *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom. Since the starting material is a *trans*-alkene, the product is a *trans*-epoxide. As the starting alkene is achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** The epoxide ring is opened by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. This is an Sₙ2-like reaction where water acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the protonated epoxide's carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond. This results in an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The overall process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. There is a general rule in stereochemistry: the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene, the anti-addition of two -OH groups produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.

This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        H      CH2CH2CH3\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n    CH3CH2CH2  H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn-addition*, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides (the *trans*-epoxide). In this case, it produces a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons of the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the back side, resulting in an *anti-addition* of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation of Reaction 1:** The combination of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti-dihydroxylation* of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A key principle in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans* (or E) alkene results in a *meso* compound (if the alkene is symmetric).\n    *   Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, backside attack by water inverts the stereocenter it attacks, leading to the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Starting with the (4S,5S)-epoxide, backside attack leads to the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   The (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol product has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2      CH2CH2CH3\n               \\    /\n                C==C\n               /    \\\n              H      H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used, resulting in an *anti-dihydroxylation*.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical principle for this case is that *anti*-addition to a *cis* (or Z) alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of two enantiomers.\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** Syn-addition of oxygen to the cis-alkene forms a single, achiral *meso*-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring opening:** Backside attack by water on the meso-epoxide leads to two different products. Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4, which is R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol. Attack at the other carbon (C5, which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. Since both carbons are equally likely to be attacked, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these stereoisomers:\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a stereoisomer of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol, but it is not an enantiomer of either. Therefore, it is a **diastereomer** to both.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on a Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\n*   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column, eluting as separate peaks.\n*   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. It will be separated. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n*   Therefore, the chemist will observe **2 peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a distinct retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n*   Therefore, the chemist will observe **3 peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that there will be 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the HPLC analysis.\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n       H   CH2CH2CH3\n        \\ /\n         C=C\n        / \\\n CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This reaction involves the *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   Reacting a *trans*-alkene via *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides. This is because the mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face of the alkene with equal probability.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These are trans-epoxides and are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening with H₂O.** This is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups across the original double bond location (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from water). The overall reaction (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is equivalent to *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   There is a general rule in stereochemistry: *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's confirm this by tracing the mechanism:\n        *   The (4R,5R)-epoxide will open via backside attack by water. Attack at C4 gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Both (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) describe the same *meso* compound, as the molecule has propyl groups on both sides, allowing for a center of inversion and making it achiral.\n        *   Similarly, the (4S,5S)-epoxide will also exclusively yield the same *meso*-diol upon hydrolysis.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, the *meso*-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n         H      H\n          \\    /\n           C==C\n          /    \\\n   CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   *Syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *meso* epoxide. This is because a plane of symmetry is maintained throughout the reaction.\n    *   The product is the single, achiral *meso*-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening with H₂O.** This is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   The general rule is: *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *racemic* mixture of two enantiomers.\n    *   Let's confirm with the mechanism:\n        *   The *meso*-epoxide (achiral) is protonated. Water, an achiral nucleophile, attacks. Because the starting materials (meso-epoxide and water) are achiral, if the products are chiral, they must be formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n        *   Attack at the two different carbons of the protonated epoxide leads to the formation of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **E1**) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **E2**).\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n*   **M:** *meso*-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   **E1:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **E2:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nWhat are the relationships between these isomers?\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of both **E1** and **E2**.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers (**M** vs. **E1**/**E2**) have different physical properties and will separate.\n    *   Enantiomers (**E1** vs. **E2**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not separate. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks: one for compound **M**, and one for the co-eluting enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing them to be separated.\n    *   It will separate the diastereomers (**M** from **E1** and **E2**).\n    *   It will also separate the enantiomers **E1** from **E2**.\n    *   Since all three compounds (**M**, **E1**, **E2**) are chemically distinct and can be resolved by a chiral column, the chromatogram will show three separate peaks.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral due to a C2 axis of symmetry perpendicular to the double bond.\n    ```\n       H         H\n        \\       /\n         C === C\n        /       \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom across the double bond is a **syn-addition**. For a trans-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation can occur from either face of the alkene with equal probability, leading to a racemic mixture of the two possible enantiomeric epoxides.\n        *   Product of this step: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This step causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This reaction proceeds via an **anti-addition** mechanism (SN2-like backside attack).\n        *   Let's consider the opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Anti-attack by water at either C4 or C5 will lead to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Similarly, the opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide by anti-attack will also lead to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two resulting products, (4R,5S)-diol and (4S,5R)-diol, are identical. This molecule has two stereocenters but is achiral because it has a center of inversion (and a plane of symmetry in a specific conformation). This type of compound is called a **meso compound**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n    CH3CH2CH2     H\n        \\       /\n         C === C\n        /       \\\n       H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** The syn-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the product is cis-4,5-epoxyoctane. This molecule has stereocenters (4R, 5S), but it is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry. It is a **meso compound**.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** The acid-catalyzed, anti-addition ring-opening of the meso-epoxide.\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-configuration) inverts its configuration to S. The other center (C5, S-configuration) is unchanged. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at the equivalent C5 (S-configuration) inverts its configuration to R. The other center (C4, R-configuration) is unchanged. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   The two products, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are **enantiomers**. Since the attack on the two carbons of the symmetric meso-epoxide is equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are enantiomers.\n*   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\nThe problem states that the resolution is as high as theoretically possible.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and separate into distinct peaks.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the achiral column will separate the meso-diol from the enantiomeric pair. The enantiomers themselves will not be separated.\n    *   **Result:** Two peaks will be observed.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column can separate all molecules that are not identical. This includes constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n    *   Our mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers: the meso compound and the two enantiomers. All three will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso-diol will be separated from the other two (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated from each other.\n    *   **Result:** Three peaks will be observed.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks in standard HPLC.**\n*   **3 peaks in chiral HPLC.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺**\n\n*   **Overall Reaction:** The two-step process of epoxidation with a peroxyacid (mCPBA) followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening with water (H₃O⁺) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** There is a well-established rule for the stereochemical outcome of such additions: The *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** Applying this rule, the anti-dihydroxylation of (E)-oct-4-ene yields a single product: the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.

This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2   H\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition (the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   A mnemonic for stereochemistry is that a *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The product is a trans-epoxide. For a symmetrically substituted alkene like oct-4-ene, this results in a pair of enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide by a nucleophile (H₂O in this case) proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   The overall reaction from alkene to diol is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical mnemonic for this is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n    *   Let's verify this through the mechanism: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxides reacts with water.\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O (anti-attack) → (4R,5S)-diol (a meso compound). Attack at C4 inverts it to S, attack at C5 inverts it to S. Wait, let's re-verify. Attack at C4 (R) inverts its configuration to S, while C5 remains R, yielding (4S,5R)-diol. Attack at C5 (R) inverts its configuration to S, while C4 remains R, yielding (4R,5S)-diol. Both (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) describe the same achiral meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O (anti-attack) → also yields the same (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is one achiral compound. Let's label it **M**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n               \\ /\n                C=C\n               / \\\n              H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The mnemonic is that a *cis*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a meso compound.\n    *   The product is a cis-epoxide, which for a symmetrically substituted alkene is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemical mnemonic is: **(Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify mechanistically: The meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxide) reacts.\n        *   Attack at the C4 (R) carbon inverts its configuration to S. The C5 (S) configuration is retained. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at the C5 (S) carbon inverts its configuration to R. The C4 (R) configuration is retained. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the attacks on C4 and C5 are equally probable, producing a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's label these enantiomers **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   **R**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **S**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **R**.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **S**.\n\n### **HPLC Chromatogram Prediction**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M vs. R, and M vs. S) have different physical properties and will have different retention times, thus separating into different peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (R vs. S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the unresolved racemic pair (R+S).\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n    *   It can separate diastereomers (as any column can, in principle).\n    *   Crucially, it can also resolve enantiomers. The interactions (R)-chiral column and (S)-chiral column are diastereomeric and have different energies, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Since M, R, and S are all distinct stereoisomers, and a chiral column can distinguish between all of them (diastereomers M vs. R/S, and enantiomers R vs. S), all three compounds will be resolved.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three peaks: one for M, one for R, and one for S.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical around the double bond, with a propyl group on each side.\n    ```\n        H       CH₂CH₂CH₃\n       / \\     /\n      C = C\n     /     \\   /\n    CH₃CH₂CH₂ H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This reaction is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides.\n    *   Products: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening with H₂O.** The protonated epoxide is attacked by water in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond (anti-attack), leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked. The overall process from alkene to diol is an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions is **\"TAM\"**: **T**rans-alkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **M**eso compound (when the alkene is symmetrical, as it is here).\n    *   Let's verify this. Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide, anti-attack by water at either C4 or C5 (which are equivalent) will lead to the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Similarly, starting with (4S,5S)-epoxide will lead to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   A compound with two equivalent chiral centers with (R,S) configuration is a meso compound. (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) are different labels for the same single meso molecule due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetrical.\n    ```\n        CH₃CH₂CH₂   CH₂CH₂CH₃\n             \\   /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n            H   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1 & 2: mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺.** This is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Another useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"**: **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **R**acemic mixture (when the alkene is symmetrical).\n    *   Let's verify this. Epoxidation of the cis-alkene gives a meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). Anti-attack by water on this meso-epoxide at C4 (which is R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol. Anti-attack at C5 (which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. Since the starting meso-epoxide is achiral, the attacks are equally probable, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the stereochemical relationships:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (meso) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated (they co-elute).\n    *   Therefore, the meso-diol (1) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair (2+3). The enantiomers (2 and 3) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   It can separate diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, it can also separate enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct compounds in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the products using different chromatographic techniques.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   H\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n               H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reagents and Transformation:**\n    *   **Step 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid)**. This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Reacting the *trans*-alkene with mCPBA can occur from the top or bottom face, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺)**. This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite the epoxide ring, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation. There is a general rule for the stereochemistry of such additions:\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a **meso** compound (if the product molecule has a plane of symmetry, which octane-4,5-diol does).\n\n    Let's verify this. Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, backside attack by water at either C4 or C5 will invert the stereocenter, leading to (4S,5R)- or (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are, in fact, the same meso compound. The same meso product is formed from the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n    Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol** [(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol].\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n               H   H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reagents and Transformation:** The reagents and overall transformation are the same as in Reaction 1: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the corresponding stereochemical rule:\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n\n    Let's verify. The epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene produces a single, achiral *meso*-epoxide [(cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane]. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening involves water attacking the two prochiral carbons (C4 and C5) from the backside. Attack at C4 and attack at C5 are equally probable and lead to a pair of enantiomeric products.\n    Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis (HPLC)**\n\nThe question assumes the highest theoretically possible resolution.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the (4R,5R)/(4S,5S) pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated on a standard achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The achiral HPLC will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: Meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   It can separate all stereoisomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities, which causes them to have different retention times.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are also readily separated.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture. It will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: Meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   Structure: CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃ (propyl groups are *trans* to each other).\n\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   A useful stereochemistry rule is: a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face of the planar double bond with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from one face yields the (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the other face yields the (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers. Thus, this step produces a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide.\n\n*   **Step 1b: Epoxide opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).**\n    *   The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The overall reaction from alkene to diol is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   Another key stereochemistry rule is: a reaction pathway that involves an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (if the product structure allows for it). The mnemonic \"Trans-Anti-Meso\" (T.A.M) can be helpful here.\n    *   Let's verify this. We start with the racemic epoxide from the previous step.\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide: The incoming water molecule attacks one of the carbons from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (anti-attack). This inverts the stereocenter it attacks. For example, attack at C4 changes its configuration from R to S. The resulting diol is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide: Similarly, anti-attack by water leads to the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    *   Structure: CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃ (propyl groups are *cis* to each other).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   This is again a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: a *cis*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a *meso* compound (if the structure is symmetrical).\n    *   The (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry. The addition of oxygen from either the top or bottom face results in the same, single product: the *cis*-epoxide, which is meso-(4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Epoxide opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).**\n    *   This is an *anti*-addition, making the overall process an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: a reaction pathway that involves an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a racemic mixture. The mnemonic \"Cis-Anti-Racemic\" (C.A.R) applies.\n    *   Let's verify this. We start with the single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   The epoxide is protonated. Water can then attack either C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R): This inverts the configuration to S. The C5 configuration remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S): This inverts the configuration to R. The C4 configuration remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the attack is equally likely at both carbons, they are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   Compound 1 is a *meso* compound.\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are a pair of *enantiomers*.\n*   Compound 1 is a *diastereomer* of both Compound 2 and Compound 3.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral HPLC columns cannot distinguish between enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the enantiomeric pair (Compounds 2 and 3) will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like Compound 1 vs. the pair of 2 & 3) have different physical properties and will be separated by the column.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will interact differently with all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   The meso compound (1) will be separated from the chiral enantiomers (2 and 3).\n    *   The two enantiomers (2 and 3) will be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analyses.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning both new C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the double bond.\n        *   The *syn*-addition of an epoxide to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction that proceeds with backside attack, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation (*syn*-addition) followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (*anti*-opening) is stereochemically equivalent to a direct *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene produces a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol** ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). This product is achiral.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\ /\n                    C=C\n                   / \\\n                  H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a racemic mixture.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and separate into distinct peaks. The meso-diol will be separated from the other two.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   This allows for the separation of **enantiomers** because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   A chiral column can also separate **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond (CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃). It is achiral.\n\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The epoxidation is a *syn-addition*, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Epoxidation:** When a symmetrical *trans*-alkene undergoes epoxidation, it forms a *trans*-epoxide. Since the attack can occur from either the top face or the bottom face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed.\n    -   (E)-oct-4-ene → (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane + (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    -   These two products are enantiomers and are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n\n4.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent is used for the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (anti) attack by a water molecule (nucleophile) on one of the epoxide carbons. This overall process results in *anti-dihydroxylation* of the original alkene.\n\n5.  **Stereochemistry of Ring Opening:** We need to consider the ring opening for both enantiomers of the epoxide.\n    -   **For (4R,5R)-epoxide:** Water can attack C4 or C5.\n        -   Attack at C4: Inverts the configuration at C4 from R to S. The configuration at C5 remains R. Product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        -   Attack at C5: Inverts the configuration at C5 from R to S. The configuration at C4 remains R. Product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        Note that (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same compound. This compound has a plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion) and is a *meso* compound.\n    -   **For (4S,5S)-epoxide:**\n        -   Attack at C4: Inverts C4 from S to R. C5 remains S. Product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the same meso compound).\n        -   Attack at C5: Inverts C5 from S to R. C4 remains S. Product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (the same meso compound).\n\n6.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The only product from Reaction 1 is the single meso compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn-addition* epoxidation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Epoxidation:** When a symmetrical *cis*-alkene undergoes epoxidation, it forms a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting material is symmetrical, the resulting epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is a *meso* compound.\n    -   (Z)-oct-4-ene → meso-(4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n4.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs an *anti*-dihydroxylation via backside attack of water.\n\n5.  **Stereochemistry of Ring Opening:** We start with the single meso-epoxide.\n    -   **For meso-(4R,5S)-epoxide:** Water can attack C4 or C5. These two attacks are equally likely.\n        -   Attack at C4 (which has R configuration): Inverts the configuration at C4 from R to S. C5 remains S. Product: **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        -   Attack at C5 (which has S configuration): Inverts the configuration at C5 from S to R. C4 remains R. Product: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    -   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the two pathways of attack are equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n6.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the stereochemical relationships:\n-   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n-   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    -   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    -   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    -   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n    -   Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    -   The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    -   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    -   It can also separate diastereomers.\n    -   Since all three stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct in a chiral environment, they will all be separated from one another (assuming ideal resolution).\n    -   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it has a C2 axis of rotation perpendicular to the double bond and passing through its center.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction, adding an oxygen atom across the double bond. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent is used for the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism where water acts as a nucleophile, resulting in *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on an (E)-alkene. A general rule in stereochemistry states that the anti-addition to an (E)-alkene results in a meso compound, provided the substituents on the double bond are identical, which they are in this case (propyl groups).\n    *   Let's trace it: (E)-oct-4-ene -> (racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane) -> hydrolysis of either enantiomer of the epoxide leads to the same single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound is achiral and has the configuration (4R,5S) or (4S,5R), which are identical.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule as it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** *Anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a (Z)-alkene. The stereochemistry rule for this is that the anti-addition to a (Z)-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace it: (Z)-oct-4-ene -> (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane) -> acid-catalyzed opening of the meso-epoxide results in a 50/50 mixture of the two possible enantiomeric products.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These are two distinct chiral compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three compounds have the following relationship:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) diol and the (4S,5S) diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nNow we predict how this three-component mixture will behave on the two different HPLC columns.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated by the column. Thus, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: A single, combined peak for the enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, a chiral column can separate diastereomers *and* enantiomers (given the problem states resolution is as high as theoretically possible).\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **three peaks**, one for each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n          H       CH2CH2CH3\n           \\     /\n            C = C\n           /     \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process.\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent opens the epoxide ring. The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide is an *anti*-addition, where the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide C-O bond.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-established stereochemical rule for this type of reaction: the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   *Mnemonic: T-A-M (Trans + Anti -> Meso)*\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains chiral centers but has a plane of symmetry. Let's call this **Product A**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n    CH3CH2CH2\\     /CH2CH2CH3\n              C = C\n             /     \\\n            H       H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is the formation of a *racemic* mixture.\n    *   *Mnemonic: C-A-R (Cis + Anti -> Racemic)*\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two enantiomers. Let's call this mixture **Product B**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationship between these isomers:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of (4R,5R)-diol.\n*   The meso-diol is also a **diastereomer** of (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on a Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\n*   **Principle:** A standard, achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated; they elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Application:**\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties. Thus, it will be separated from them.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation. It can also separate diastereomers. Therefore, a chiral column can separate all stereoisomers in a mixture.\n*   **Application:** The chiral column will separate the three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    (Note: The order of elution depends on the specific column and conditions.)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Standard (achiral) HPLC: **2 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **3 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and how the resulting mixture of products would be analyzed by different types of chromatography.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n    *   When a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, the resulting epoxide is also *trans*.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack of mCPBA can occur from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability. This results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide to form a diol. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition. A water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond, causing an inversion of configuration at the center that is attacked.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides.\n    *   For the (4R,5R)-epoxide, attack by H₂O at C4 (inverting it to S) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 (inverting it to S) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. It is a *meso* compound.\n    *   The same *meso* compound is formed from the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a single product: the *meso*-compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA useful mnemonic for dihydroxylation reactions is that **anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a meso product.**\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom to the *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is symmetric, epoxidation from either face yields the same single product: (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This epoxide is a *meso* compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The *anti*-addition (ring-opening) of the *meso*-epoxide is next.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is, say, R) inverts its configuration to S, while C5 remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reagent and an achiral (meso) intermediate, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nAnother useful mnemonic is that **anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture.**\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the *meso* compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   The *meso* compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe mixture of these three stereoisomers is run on two different HPLC columns.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical and chemical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and be separated. The *meso* compound will separate from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the *meso* compound, and one for the unresolved racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The *meso* compound is a diastereomer to the other two and will also have a unique retention time, eluting as its own peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the *meso* compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagents:**\n    *   **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent opens the epoxide ring. This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, which proceeds via *anti*-attack of a water molecule.\n\n3.  **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening) results in an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** We can use the mnemonic \"TAME\" (Trans + Anti -> Meso).\n    *   Starting with a **T**rans alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **A**nti-addition (anti-dihydroxylation).\n    *   The product will be a **M**eso compound.\n    *   The product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. A meso compound is achiral but has chiral centers. In this case, the stereoisomer is (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which is identical to (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We can use the mnemonic \"CARS\" (Cis + Anti -> Racemic).\n    *   Starting with a **C**is alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **A**nti-addition (anti-dihydroxylation).\n    *   The product will be a **R**acemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The products of Reaction 2 are **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These are two distinct chiral molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). Let's call them **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **R**: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **S**: (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of both **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like M vs. R, and M vs. S) have different physical properties and will have different retention times. They will be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like R and S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will have the same retention time and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: Compound **M** (the meso-diol)\n        *   Peak 2: Compounds **R** and **S** co-eluting (the racemic pair)\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral.

This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process.\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The sequence of a *syn*-epoxidation followed by an *anti*-ring opening results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** There is a well-established rule for the stereochemical outcome of anti-addition to alkenes:\n    *   **An (E)-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a meso product.**\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** Applying this rule, the anti-dihydroxylation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains chiral centers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, meaning the overall transformation is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We apply the corresponding stereochemical rule for (Z)-alkenes:\n    *   **A (Z)-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** Applying this rule, the anti-dihydroxylation of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This product consists of two different molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Characterize the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe product mixture is analyzed on two different HPLC columns.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This type of column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the achiral column will separate the meso-diol from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Observation:** One peak for the meso-diol and one peak for the co-eluting (4R,5R) and (4S,S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This type of column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It will separate the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,S)-diol into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will also be separated and appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Observation:** One peak for the (4R,5R)-diol, a second peak for the (4S,S)-diol, and a third peak for the meso-diol.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A. Let me re-check my final option mapping.\nStandard HPLC: 2 peaks\nChiral HPLC: 3 peaks\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nA) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC -> Incorrect.\nB) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC -> Incorrect.\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC -> Correct.\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC -> Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the resulting products using two different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide is an **anti-addition**, where the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide ring, leading to the formation of a diol.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring-opening) results in a net **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:**\n    We are performing an anti-addition on a trans-alkene. A well-known stereochemical rule (often remembered by the mnemonic \"TAM\": Trans-Anti-Meso) states that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a **meso compound**.\n\n    *Let's verify this mechanistically:*\n    1.  Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) gives a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of this racemic mixture:\n        *   The (4R,5R)-epoxide undergoes backside attack by water. Attack at C4 (inverting its configuration from R to S) yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The (4S,5S)-epoxide undergoes backside attack by water. Attack at C4 (inverting its configuration from S to R) yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    3.  The products are (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. For a molecule like octane-4,5-diol where the substituents on the two stereocenters (C4 and C5) are identical (H, OH, propyl), the (R,S) and (S,R) forms are the same achiral molecule—a meso compound. This is because it possesses a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also a net **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n    We are performing an anti-addition on a cis-alkene. The stereochemical rule (mnemonic \"CAR\": Cis-Anti-Racemic) states that the anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n\n    *Let's verify this mechanistically:*\n    1.  Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) gives a cis-epoxide. The cis-epoxide has a plane of symmetry, so it is a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of this meso-epoxide:\n        *   The starting epoxide is symmetric. Attack by water can occur at C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. This forms **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. This forms **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    3.  The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images—they are a pair of enantiomers. Since both pathways are equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these compounds are:\n*   Compound 1 is achiral (meso).\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are a pair of enantiomers.\n*   Compound 1 is a diastereomer of compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like compound 1 and the pair 2/3) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   Therefore, the achiral HPLC will show two peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Total: 2 peaks**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair (compounds 2 and 3) into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound (compound 1), being a diastereomer to the other two, will also be separated from them. As an achiral compound, it will produce a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show three peaks, one for each unique compound in the mixture:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Total: 3 peaks**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     H\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent is used for epoxidation. The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid is a **syn-addition**, meaning both C-O bonds form on the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent is used for the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via an **anti-addition** mechanism, where the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-hydrolysis) results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:**\n    There's a well-established stereochemical rule for this type of reaction:\n    *   **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**\n\n    Let's verify this: The anti-addition of two -OH groups to a trans-alkene creates two chiral centers. For (E)-oct-4-ene, this process yields **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a single, achiral compound.\n\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** One compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used: mCPBA followed by H3O+. This is again an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n    The stereochemical rule for this case is:\n    *   **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**\n\n    Let's verify this: The anti-addition of two -OH groups to a cis-alkene also creates two chiral centers. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, this process yields a mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the chiral products must be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n\n    *   **Products of Reaction 2:** Two compounds that are enantiomers of each other (a racemic pair).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   meso-diol and (4R,5R)-diol are **diastereomers**.\n*   meso-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are also **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of peaks observed on two types of HPLC columns, assuming perfect resolution.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral stationary phase interacts identically with enantiomers. Therefore, it **cannot** separate them. The racemic pair of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will have the same retention time and elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties (like polarity, shape, etc.) and will interact differently with the stationary phase. Therefore, an achiral column **can** separate diastereomers. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the (R,R)/(S,S) pair, so it will have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment. It interacts differently with enantiomers, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different energies. Therefore, a chiral column **can** separate enantiomers. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   Since a chiral column can also separate diastereomers, the meso-diol will also be separated from the other two isomers. As the meso compound is achiral, it will give only one peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture. It will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-diol, and one for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence**\n\nThe reaction sequence involves two steps applied to two different starting materials:\n1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This is a classic method for creating an epoxide from an alkene. The key stereochemical feature of this reaction is that it is a **syn addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (cis or trans) dictates the stereochemistry of the resulting epoxide.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reaction opens the epoxide to form a diol (a compound with two hydroxyl groups). The key stereochemical feature here is that it is an **anti-addition**. The incoming nucleophile (H₂O) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond, leading to an inversion of configuration at the center that is attacked.\n\nThis two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a standard method for the **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the product(s) of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a meso compound (if the alkene is symmetrically substituted, which it is).\n*   **Let's verify this step-by-step:**\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA (syn addition) → This forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Acid-catalyzed opening of this racemic mixture (anti-addition):\n        *   Opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide gives (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also gives (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Product Analysis:** The products are (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. A compound with two chiral centers bearing identical substituents is a meso compound if the configurations are opposite (R,S or S,R). Therefore, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is a meso compound. The (4S,5R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** A single product is formed: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the product(s) of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers (if the alkene is symmetrically substituted).\n*   **Let's verify this step-by-step:**\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA (syn addition) → This forms a cis-epoxide. Since the starting material is a symmetrical cis-alkene, the resulting epoxide is a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane (which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry).\n    *   Acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide (anti-addition):\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Product Analysis:** The products are (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed in equal amounts from an achiral starting material, the product is a racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Two products are formed, which constitute a **racemic mixture of (4R,4R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different molecules (stereoisomers):\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these stereoisomers is:\n*   (2) and (3) are **enantiomers**.\n*   (1) is a **diastereomer** of both (2) and (3).\n\n**Step 5: Predict the HPLC chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different polarity and will elute at a different time.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The **enantiomers** (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a different retention time and will appear as its own separate peak.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,4R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.

This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral and symmetrically substituted (a propyl group on each side of the double bond).\n    ```\n        H       CH2CH2CH3\n         \\     /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n        *   Reacting a trans-alkene with a syn-addition reagent results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides.\n        *   The attack of mCPBA can happen from the top face or the bottom face of the planar alkene with equal probability.\n        *   This produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-dipropyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-dipropyloxirane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via a backside attack by a water molecule (SN2-type mechanism), resulting in an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:**\n    *   We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *trans*-alkene.\n    *   A useful mnemonic for stereochemistry is: **trans + anti = meso**.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers because it possesses an internal element of symmetry (like a plane or center of inversion).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral and symmetrically substituted.\n    ```\n        H           H\n         \\         /\n          C = C\n         /         \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n    *   We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The corresponding mnemonic is: **cis + anti = racemic**.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture, which is a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound, let's call it **M**) from Reaction 1.\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer, let's call it **E1**) from Reaction 2.\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer, let's call it **E2**) from Reaction 2.\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a diastereomer of **E2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe combined mixture of M, E1, and E2 is analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral columns separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like M and the E1/E2 pair) have different physical properties. They will interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** We will observe two peaks.\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (M).\n        *   Peak 2: The unresolved racemic mixture of enantiomers (E1 + E2).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   In a chiral environment, **enantiomers** (E1 and E2) interact differently with the stationary phase (forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities). This allows for their separation into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The **meso compound** (M), being a diastereomer of E1 and E2, will also have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** All three stereoisomers will be resolved. We will observe three peaks.\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (M).\n        *   Peak 2: One enantiomer (E1).\n        *   Peak 3: The other enantiomer (E2).\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is a symmetrical molecule, so it is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   The syn-addition to a trans-alkene results in a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation can occur from either the top face or the bottom face of the double bond with equal probability.\n    *   Attacking from one face produces one enantiomer of the epoxide, and attacking from the other face produces the other enantiomer.\n    *   The product of this step is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen followed by a backside (anti) attack by a water molecule (Sₙ2-like). This process results in an anti-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n    *   We have a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide, and we are performing an anti-addition of two -OH groups.\n    *   Let's consider the stereochemical outcome. The overall transformation is an anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene. A common rule in stereochemistry is: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound** (if the product molecule has a plane of symmetry).\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide via anti-attack by water leads to inversion at one of the carbons. For example, attack at C4 inverts its configuration from R to S, while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide via anti-attack by water leads to inversion at one carbon. For example, attack at C4 inverts its configuration from S to R, while C5 remains S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The compounds (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has two stereocenters but also has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is a symmetrical molecule and is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** Again, this is a syn-addition.\n    *   Syn-addition to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide (also called a meso-epoxide in this case).\n    *   The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. Only one epoxide product is formed.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   We are starting with a cis-alkene and performing an overall anti-dihydroxylation. The stereochemistry rule is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the opening of the meso-epoxide.\n        *   The meso-epoxide is attacked by water from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (anti-attack).\n        *   Attack at C4 (let's say it's R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   Since attack at C4 and C5 is equally probable, a 50:50 mixture of the two products is formed.\n    *   The products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical species:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules are all stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol.\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) forms are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso form is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) forms.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute), appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the meso-diol from the chiral diols (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   The column will also separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+).\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA results in the formation of an epoxide via a *syn*-addition mechanism (the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These are a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The epoxide is then opened by nucleophilic attack of water under acidic conditions. This reaction proceeds via an *anti*-addition mechanism (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen). This two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n    *   According to the rules of stereochemistry, an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound (when the substituents on the double bond are identical, as they are here with two propyl groups).\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the products from Step 1a:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide (an enantiomer) via *anti*-attack by water gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide (the other enantiomer) via *anti*-attack by water also gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is the same as (4S,5R)-diol).\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is a *meso* compound because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the *meso* compound, **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single chemical compound.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H3O+). This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction.\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation.**\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. A *syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *meso* epoxide.\n    *   The product is *meso*-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This is a single achiral, meso compound.\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   Again, this is an *anti*-addition mechanism. According to the rules of stereochemistry, an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the product from Step 2a:\n        *   The *meso* epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, has two enantiotopic carbon atoms (C4 and C5).\n        *   *Anti*-attack by water at C4 (the R center) will invert its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   *Anti*-attack by water at C5 (the S center) will invert its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers and are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This consists of two different compounds (enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the *meso* compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe *meso* compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties. The *meso* compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   Thus, the achiral HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the racemic pair and one for the meso compound.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will differentiate between the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers, causing them to elute at different times. This will result in two separate peaks.\n    *   The *meso* compound is also a distinct molecule and will have its own unique retention time, different from both enantiomers. It will produce a third peak.\n    *   Thus, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture, resulting in **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a center of inversion.\n    ```\n       H      C3H7\n        \\    /\n         C==C\n        /    \\\n      C3H7    H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **trans-alkene + syn-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. Let's call them E(R,R) and E(S,S).\n\n*   **Step 1b: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H3O+).** The acid protonates the epoxide's oxygen, making it a good leaving group. Water then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the epoxide ring. This nucleophilic attack occurs with an inversion of configuration at the site of attack (SN2-like mechanism). This is an **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl groups across the original double bond.\n    *   Let's analyze the ring-opening for each enantiomeric epoxide:\n        *   **For the (4R,5R)-epoxide (E(R,R))**:\n            *   Water attacks C4: Inversion at C4 (R → S). The configuration becomes (4S, 5R).\n            *   Water attacks C5: Inversion at C5 (R → S). The configuration becomes (4R, 5S).\n            *   (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are designations for the same **meso** compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n        *   **For the (4S,5S)-epoxide (E(S,S))**:\n            *   Water attacks C4: Inversion at C4 (S → R). The configuration becomes (4R, 5S).\n            *   Water attacks C5: Inversion at C5 (S → R). The configuration becomes (4S, 5R).\n            *   Again, both attacks lead to the same **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Therefore, the final product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n       H      H\n        \\    /\n         C==C\n        /    \\\n      C3H7  C3H7\n    ```\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA (syn-addition).**\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **cis-alkene + syn-addition → meso compound**.\n    *   The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a single, achiral meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H3O+) (anti-addition).**\n    *   We start with the single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The two carbons (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic.\n    *   Water attacks the protonated epoxide:\n        *   Attack at C4 (which has S configuration): Inversion at C4 (S → R). The product configuration is (4R, 5R).\n        *   Attack at C5 (which has R configuration): Inversion at C5 (R → S). The product configuration is (4S, 5S).\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since attack at either enantiotopic carbon is equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts, resulting in a **racemic mixture**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNote that the meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like the meso-diol compared to the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties. Therefore, they will be separated and will elute at different times.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol (which is achiral) will elute as a single peak. Since it is a diastereomer of the other two, its retention time will be different from both.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 C=C\n               H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The epoxidation is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A *trans*-alkene will yield a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the reaction must produce an achiral product or a racemic mixture of chiral products. Attacking the planar alkene from the top face or the bottom face results in two different products that are mirror images of each other. These are the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers of 4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Product of epoxidation: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by water on the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen (an Sₙ2-like backside attack), resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two -OH groups.\n\n4.  **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *trans*-alkene. There is a useful mnemonic for this: \"**T**rans-**A**nti-**M**eso\" (TAM). When the alkene is symmetrically substituted (as oct-4-ene is), a *trans*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide via backside attack by water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has two stereocenters but also has a center of inversion, making it a *meso* compound and therefore achiral.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 C=C\n               H     H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene yields a *cis*-epoxide. In this case, the product is cis-4,5-epoxyoctane. This epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is a *meso* compound.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs the same *anti*-dihydroxylation as in Reaction 1.\n\n4.  **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *cis*-alkene. The mnemonic here is \"**C**is-**A**nti-**E**nantiomers\" (CAE). A symmetrically substituted *cis*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the *meso*-epoxide (let's say it's 4R,5S) via backside attack.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) causes inversion, resulting in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) causes inversion, resulting in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\nNow, let's predict the chromatograms:\n\n**A) Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for the meso-diol.\n    *   One peak for the co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   **Total Peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   Diastereomers will also be separated.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for the meso-diol (it is a diastereomer to the other two).\n    *   One peak for the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   One peak for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   **Total Peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical about the double bond. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction proceeds in two steps:\n    1.  Treatment with one equivalent of mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid). This is a standard epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, a *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. A nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an S_N2-like fashion, which means it attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** A *syn*-addition (epoxidation) followed by an *anti*-addition (hydrolysis) results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-(E)-alkene produces a *meso*-compound (if the resulting molecule has the potential for a plane of symmetry, which octan-4,5-diol does).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, the achiral meso-compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. Like its E-isomer, it is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this case is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-(Z)-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore *cannot* be separated. They will elute from the column at the exact same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomeric pair of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   The result is a total of **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer.\n    *   As a result, a chiral column can separate enantiomers from each other. It can also, of course, separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   The chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   **Peak 3:** The (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   The result is a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC column and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC column. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this stereochemistry problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2   H\n           \\  /\n            C==C\n           /  \\\n          H   CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   The *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is symmetric and achiral, the epoxidation reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction where a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the oxygen bridge. This is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A key rule in stereochemistry is: **_anti_-addition to a _trans_-alkene yields a meso compound.**\n    *   Let's verify this. The (4R,5R)-epoxide will be attacked by water, inverting the configuration at one carbon (e.g., C4), leading to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The (4S,5S)-epoxide will similarly lead to (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are different names for the *same* achiral meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2   CH2CH3\n           \\  /\n            C==C\n           /  \\\n          H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used: mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺. This is again an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding rule in stereochemistry is: **_anti_-addition to a _cis_-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   First, the *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene forms the *cis*-epoxide (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane), which is a single achiral, meso compound.\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two equivalent carbons (C4 or C5).\n        *   Attack at C4 leads to one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 leads to the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting epoxide is achiral, the two pathways are equally probable, resulting in a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Products of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these compounds is as follows:\n*   Compound 1 (meso) is a **diastereomer** of Compound 2 ((R,R)).\n*   Compound 1 (meso) is also a **diastereomer** of Compound 3 ((S,S)).\n*   Compound 2 ((R,R)) and Compound 3 ((S,S)) are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like compound 1 vs. the 2/3 pair) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   Therefore, the achiral HPLC will show two peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (R,R)- and (S,S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Total: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomers (compounds 2 and 3) into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the meso compound (compound 1) from the other two, as it is their diastereomer.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique molecules in the mixture.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Total: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks observed in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule due to a center of inversion.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1) epoxidation with mCPBA, followed by 2) acid-catalyzed ring-opening (hydrolysis). This sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the double bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry Principle:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene that is symmetrically substituted results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   `trans-alkene + anti-addition -> meso product`\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound. Let's call it **Meso-diol**.\n    ```\n        HO   H\n          \\  |\n           C--C--OH\n          /  |\n    Pr---H   ---Pr   (showing one possible conformation)\n    ```\n    This molecule has two stereocenters, (4R, 5S), and possesses a center of inversion, making it achiral.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule due to a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is the same: anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemistry Principle:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene that is symmetrically substituted results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   `cis-alkene + anti-addition -> racemic product`\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). They are produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture. Let's call them **(R,R)-diol** and **(S,S)-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(R,R)-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(S,S)-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the stereochemical relationships between these three compounds:\n*   **(R,R)-diol** and **(S,S)-diol** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **Meso-diol** is a **diastereomer** of both (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe product mixture is analyzed on two different HPLC columns.\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   This separation technique relies on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, such as (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers**, such as the Meso-diol and the (R,R)/(S,S) pair, have different physical properties. They will be separated and elute at different times, appearing as **distinct peaks**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** We will observe two peaks. One peak for the Meso-diol and another peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair ((R,R)-diol + (S,S)-diol).\n*   **Total Peaks = 2**\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase which creates a chiral environment.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, forming temporary diastereomeric complexes with different stabilities. This allows for the separation of **enantiomers**. Therefore, (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   Diastereomers are also separated by chiral HPLC (as they are by achiral HPLC). Thus, the Meso-diol will elute at a different time from both the (R,R)-diol and the (S,S)-diol.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** All three stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks = 3**\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks observed in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, followed by H₃O⁺**\n\nThis reaction sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the starting alkene. We need to determine the stereochemistry of the product, octane-4,5-diol.\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** The two-step process of epoxidation with mCPBA (a *syn*-addition) followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening (an S_N2-like *anti*-attack) results in an overall *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the double bond.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** A useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions is **\"TAM\"**, which stands for **T**rans-**A**nti-**M**eso. This means that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound is an achiral molecule that contains chiral centers. For octane-4,5-diol, the meso form is (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral product.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, followed by H₃O⁺**\n\nThis is also an anti-dihydroxylation reaction.\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene.

This means that the anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture.\n    *   A racemic mixture consists of a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers. For octane-4,5-diol, the enantiomers are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This constitutes two different chemical compounds.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (the meso isomer) is a **diastereomer** of compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe product mixture is analyzed on two types of HPLC columns.\n\n#### **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus can be separated on a standard achiral column.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the reactions and the subsequent HPLC analysis.\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene which is achiral. The structure is CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃, with the two propyl groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the two new C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the original double bond.\n    *   Since (E)-oct-4-ene is planar, the mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from the top face and attack from the bottom face produce non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n    *   Therefore, the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Step 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺) Treatment.** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sₙ2-style) attack by a water molecule on one of the epoxide carbons. This results in an **anti-addition** of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original C-C bond of the epoxide.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of one of the enantiomers, say (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 4 (which has R configuration) leads to inversion of stereochemistry at that carbon, resulting in an S configuration. The configuration at carbon 5 (R) remains unchanged. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 5 (which has R configuration) leads to inversion at C5, resulting in an S configuration. The configuration at carbon 4 (R) remains unchanged. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The products (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a **meso compound**.\n    *   Performing the same analysis on the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, also yields the same meso-diol.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is the single, achiral **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene which is achiral. The two propyl groups are on the same side of the double bond.\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA (syn-addition).**\n    *   When (Z)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, the resulting epoxide will have the two propyl groups on the same side of the ring (a cis-epoxide).\n    *   This cis-epoxide has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C4-C5 bond and passing through the oxygen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a single **meso compound**: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Step 2: Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺) Treatment (anti-addition).**\n    *   We now perform an acid-catalyzed ring-opening on the meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The two carbons (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic, meaning attack at either carbon is equally likely.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 4 (R configuration) causes inversion, leading to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack by H₂O at carbon 5 (S configuration) causes inversion, leading to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the attack is equally probable at both sites, they are formed in equal amounts.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNote that the meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Part 4: HPLC Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC separates molecules based on physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In our mixture, the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diol) will co-elute as one peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair, will have different properties and will elute as a separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different energies and stabilities.\n    *   Since chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers, it can certainly also separate diastereomers.\n    *   It will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-diol, and one for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs an epoxidation on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. The epoxidation of a trans-alkene produces a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. For (E)-oct-4-ene, this yields a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on one of the protonated epoxide carbons. This attack occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl groups relative to each other.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is a method for *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A key principle in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (if the substituents allow for a plane of symmetry, which they do here since the alkene is symmetrical).\n    *   Let's follow the intermediates: The racemic mixture of epoxides ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) reacts with water.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide at either C4 or C5 leads to inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon, producing the (4S,5R)-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide at either C4 or C5 produces the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   The (4R,5S)-diol and (4S,5R)-diol are the same molecule: meso-octane-4,5-diol, which is an achiral compound with an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is the formation of a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's follow the intermediates: The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene forms a *meso*-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   Acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide involves water attacking either C4 or C5.\n    *   Attack at C4 (an R center) inverts it to S, yielding the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (an S center) inverts it to R, yielding the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus will have different retention times and appear as separate peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show one peak for the meso-diol and a second, single peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) + (4S,5S)).\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   In this chiral environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times. Thus, enantiomers can be separated.\n    *   Diastereomers will also be separated.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene which is achiral. The two groups attached to the double bond are identical (n-propyl groups).\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn-addition*, meaning both C-O bonds form on the same face of the alkene. For a trans-alkene, this results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the product will be a racemic mixture of the two possible chiral trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the backside (anti-attack relative to the epoxide oxygen). This is an *anti-addition* step.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation (syn) followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti) results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** A well-known rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene (with identical substituents) results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's trace it:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O → Backside attack at either C4 or C5 inverts the configuration at that carbon, leading to (4S,5R)-diol or (4R,5S)-diol. Both designations refer to the same single meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O → Backside attack leads to the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene.

This is a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom to the double bond is a **syn-addition**. When a trans-alkene undergoes syn-addition, it forms a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides. In this case, it produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the oxygen bridge. This is an **anti-attack**, which inverts the stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction, epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, is an **anti-dihydroxylation**. A general rule in stereochemistry is that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   Let's trace it:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to S) or C5 (inverting it to S). Both attacks lead to the same product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, which is a meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to R) or C5 (inverting it to R). Both attacks also lead to the same meso product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺), meaning this is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace it:\n        *   First, the syn-addition (epoxidation) to the cis-alkene forms a single meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Then, the anti-attack (hydrolysis) on this meso epoxide occurs:\n            *   Attack at the C4 (R-center) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack at the C5 (S-center) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   Compound 2 and Compound 3 are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   Compound 1 is a **diastereomer** of Compound 2 (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n*   Compound 1 is also a **diastereomer** of Compound 3.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   Standard HPLC columns are achiral. They separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like compound 1 and the pair 2/3) have different physical properties. They will interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated into **different peaks**.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show two peaks: one for the meso compound and a second for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Total Peaks = 2.**\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer.\n*   **Enantiomers** will have different affinities for the chiral stationary phase and will be separated into **two distinct peaks**. So, compound 2 and compound 3 will be resolved.\n*   The **meso compound** (compound 1) is a diastereomer to both enantiomers and will also have a different retention time. It will appear as its own separate peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers.\n*   **Total Peaks = 3.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and a subsequent understanding of how the resulting mixture of isomers will be analyzed by both achiral and chiral chromatography.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2      H\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. The addition of the oxygen atom is a *syn*-addition, meaning it adds to the same face of the double bond. The epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack from the top face and bottom face are equally likely, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent opens the epoxide ring via an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside attack of a water molecule (nucleophile) on one of the epoxide carbons. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening) is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso*-compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide via backside attack at either C4 or C5 results in the (4R,5S)-diol, which is a *meso*-compound due to an internal center of symmetry. Opening its enantiomer, the (4S,5S)-epoxide, also yields the same (4R,5S)-meso-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the achiral **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2      CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H3O+). This is again an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify: Epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene produces a *cis*-epoxide, which is a *meso*-compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). The subsequent *anti*-addition (ring-opening) to this *meso*-epoxide will produce two enantiomers. Attack at C4 (let's say it's R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol, while attack at C5 (S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. These two products are enantiomers and are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity) in an achiral environment.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair. It will appear as a **separate peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own **third peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze the Reactions**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the stereochemical outcome of the two-step reaction sequence applied to two different starting materials.

Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide with water (H3O+).\n\nThis overall process results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to the opposite faces of the original double bond.\n\nA helpful mnemonic for the stereochemistry of such additions is:\n*   **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition → **R**acemic mixture (enantiomers)\n*   **T**rans-alkene + **A**nti-addition → **M**eso compound\n\nLet's apply this to each reaction.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene.

Specifically, it is the (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which is identical to (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n3.  **Applying the Rule (C + A → R):** A *cis*-alkene undergoing *anti*-addition yields a *racemic* mixture of enantiomers.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers of octane-4,5-diol: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's label these enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n\n*   **M**: The meso-diol from Reaction 1.\n*   **E1**: One enantiomer of the diol from Reaction 2, e.g., (4R, 5R).\n*   **E2**: The other enantiomer from Reaction 2, e.g., (4S, 5S).\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a diastereomer of **E2**.\n\n### **Part 3: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe final step is to predict how this mixture of three compounds will behave on the two different HPLC columns.\n\n**A) Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity and size. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Diastereomers (**M** vs. **E1**/**E2**) have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (**E1** vs. **E2**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: The meso compound **M**.\n    *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with the two enantiomers of a chiral molecule. It can separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The column will separate the diastereomers (**M** from **E1**/**E2**).\n    *   Crucially, the chiral column will also separate the enantiomers **E1** and **E2** from each other.\n*   **Observation:** All three stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: The meso compound **M**.\n    *   Peak 2: Enantiomer **E1**.\n    *   Peak 3: Enantiomer **E2**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene and is symmetrical about the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation overall.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene. There's a useful mnemonic for predicting the stereochemistry of such reactions: **\"Trans-Anti-Meso\"**.\n    *   Starting with a **trans**-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **anti**-addition (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed opening).\n    *   On a symmetrical alkene, this yields a **meso** compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is a single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral but contains stereocenters.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene and is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), leading to an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** We can use another mnemonic: **\"Cis-Anti-Racemic\"**.\n    *   Starting with a **cis**-alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **anti**-addition.\n    *   This yields a **racemic** mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso compound (4R,5S) is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   However, it *can* separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n    *   Therefore, the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diol) will co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n    *   The meso diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will elute at a different time and produce a separate peak.\n    *   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed on the standard HPLC.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer of a racemic pair.\n    *   It will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is also a unique chemical entity (a diastereomer to the others) and will produce its own, third peak.\n    *   **Result:** **3 peaks** will be observed on the chiral HPLC.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of two stereospecific reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation of the resulting product mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        Pr      H\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n        H      Pr   (Pr = propyl, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn-addition* across the double bond. The oxygen atom adds to both carbons from the same face of the alkene.\n    *   Because the starting alkene is planar, the mCPBA can attack from the \"top\" face or the \"bottom\" face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from the top and bottom faces of the trans-alkene produces two different stereoisomers of the epoxide, which are enantiomers to each other.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   So, the first step produces a **racemic mixture** of epoxides.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sɴ2-type) attack by a water molecule on one of the carbon atoms of the ring. This is an *anti-addition* of the two hydroxyl groups (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water molecule).\n    *   The overall reaction (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed opening) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   A useful stereochemistry rule is: **anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a meso compound.**\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide by backside attack of water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide by backside attack of water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (S → R), while C5 remains S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) designations describe the exact same molecule. This molecule has two chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a center of inversion, making it a **meso compound**.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        Pr      Pr\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n        H      H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn-addition* of oxygen to the cis-alkene can happen from the top or bottom face. However, due to the symmetry of the cis-alkene, both modes of attack produce the same, single achiral epoxide. This product is a **meso epoxide**, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of this meso-epoxide will occur.\n    *   The overall reaction is again *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: **anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   The starting epoxide is the meso compound (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Backside attack by water at C4 (which is R) will invert it to S. The configuration at C5 remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Backside attack by water at C5 (which is S) will invert it to R. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   (4S,5S) and (4R,5R) are non-superimposable mirror images, i.e., they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the attack at C4 and C5 is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-diol** ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2).\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The Meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by achiral HPLC and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will form one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral HPLC. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Thus, it will have a different retention time.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   It will separate the two **enantiomers**, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the **meso-diol** from the two chiral diols, as it is a diastereomer and will have a different interaction with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans* alkene. It is achiral.\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** mCPBA adds an oxygen atom across the double bond in a *syn* fashion (both C-O bonds form on the same face of the alkene). This reaction converts (E)-oct-4-ene into *trans*-4,5-epoxyoctane. Because the starting material is symmetrical, attack from either face yields the same single, achiral (meso) epoxide.\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** Aqueous acid protonates the epoxide, and water attacks as a nucleophile. This ring-opening is an Sₙ2-type reaction that proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. This overall process is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition of a reagent to a *trans* (E) alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis* alkene. It is also achiral.\n    *   **Step 1 & 2:** The reaction sequence is the same as in Reaction 1, resulting in an overall *anti*-addition of two -OH groups.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding stereochemical rule states that the *anti*-addition of a reagent to a *cis* (Z) alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix) of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are two distinct chiral molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   **Stereochemical Relationships:**\n        *   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n        *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S).\n\n4.  **Predict the HPLC Chromatograms:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n        *   **Enantiomers** ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** (the meso-diol vs. the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties. They will be separated and elute at different times.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved pair of enantiomers.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This environment interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n        *   A chiral column can separate diastereomers.\n        *   Crucially, a chiral column can also separate enantiomers.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will separate all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture. It will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\nThe analysis concludes that the product mixture will produce:\n*   **2 peaks** in standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the principles of chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the product of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   When a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene will form a 1:1 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Let's call this racemic epoxide mixture **E-Epoxide**.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid. This is a ring-opening reaction where water acts as a nucleophile. The mechanism is SN2-like, proceeding with *anti*-addition (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the epoxide's C-O bond).\n    *   Starting with the racemic **E-Epoxide** and performing an *anti*-addition leads to a meso diol.\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide by H₂O (anti-attack) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide by H₂O (anti-attack) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are actually the *same* molecule. This molecule has a center of inversion and is achiral, making it a *meso* compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*(Mnemonic: A common mnemonic for dihydroxylation is **TRAM**: **T**rans-alkene + **R**acemic intermediate (from syn-addition) -> **M**eso product (from anti-opening). Or more directly for the overall reaction: **Trans + Anti = Meso**)*\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the product of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   When a *cis*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a *meso* epoxide.\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene will form meso-4,5-epoxyoctane ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). This single product is achiral. Let's call it **Z-Epoxide**.\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The *meso* **Z-Epoxide** undergoes *anti*-addition of H₂O.\n    *   Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) of the meso-epoxide will give one enantiomer of the diol, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) will give the other enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*(Mnemonic: The counterpart to the one above is **CAR**: **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition -> **R**acemic product)*\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules have the following relationship:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol cannot be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties. Thus, the meso-diol will have a different retention time and elute as a **separate peak**.\n    *   Total peaks observed = 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso-compound) = **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they will interact differently with the stationary phase.\n    *   The enantiomers (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will also have a different retention time and will be resolved as a **third distinct peak**.\n    *   Total peaks observed = 1 (for the meso-compound) + 1 (for the R,R-enantiomer) + 1 (for the S,S-enantiomer) = **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemistry of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the products using two different types of HPLC.\n\nLet's break down each reaction:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis two-step sequence is an **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene. The first step, reaction with mCPBA, is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom to form an epoxide. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring-opening by water, is an anti-addition of the second hydroxyl group. The net result is the addition of two hydroxyl groups across the double bond in an anti-fashion.\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. It is achiral as it possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n2.  **Stereochemical Rule**: The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   **Step-by-step confirmation:**\n        *   Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) with mCPBA (syn-addition) yields a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti-addition of H₂O) of this racemic mixture opens the epoxides. Let's analyze one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-epoxide:\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is R) causes an inversion of configuration, leading to an S configuration at C4. The configuration at C5 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is R) causes an inversion, leading to an S configuration at C5. The configuration at C4 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two potential products, (4R,5S)-diol and (4S,5R)-diol, are in fact the same single molecule because it is a meso compound (it has stereocenters but is achiral due to a center of inversion). The reaction of the other epoxide enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, also yields the same meso diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1**: A single product is formed, which is the meso compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (which can be named (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis is also an anti-dihydroxylation reaction.\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. It is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Stereochemical Rule**: The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   **Step-by-step confirmation:**\n        *   Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) with mCPBA (syn-addition) yields a single achiral meso epoxide: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane (which can be named (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti-addition of H₂O) of this meso-epoxide:\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C4 (which is R) causes an inversion to S. The configuration at C5 (S) is unchanged. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n            *   Attack by H₂O at C5 (which is S) causes an inversion to R. The configuration at C4 (R) is unchanged. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two products, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, are enantiomers. Since attack at the two equivalent carbons (C4 and C5) is equally likely, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2**: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call them **P** and **P'**.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **P**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **P'**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are:\n*   **P** and **P'** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of both **P** and **P'**. (For example, compare M=(4R,5S) to P=(4R,5R); they have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C4).\n\n### HPLC Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC**:\n    *   Achiral HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. Therefore, compound **M** will have a different retention time from **P** and **P'**.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, **P** and **P'** will have the exact same retention time and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for M, and one for the P/P' pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC**:\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment where enantiomers can interact differently and thus be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (**P** and **P'**) will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (**M** vs. **P** and **P'**) are also separated.\n    *   **Compound M** is achiral (meso), so it will appear as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique stereoisomers. It will show **3 peaks**: one for M, one for P, and one for P'.\n\n### Summary of Observations\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and the subsequent analysis of the product mixture using two different types of chromatography.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical around the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA, 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This two-step process results in the anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   The first step, reaction with mCPBA, is an epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. The epoxidation of a trans-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene) results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. Specifically, a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   The second step is the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water. This is an anti-addition, where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, inverting the stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups. A useful mnemonic for this type of reaction is: **\"Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound\"**.\n    *   Let's trace this: Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, acid-catalyzed attack by water at C4 leads to the (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 leads to (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since oct-4-ene is symmetrical, the resulting diol (octane-4,5-diol) has two identical substituents on the stereogenic carbons (a propyl group and a hydrogen). Therefore, the (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) configurations represent the same single, achiral **meso** compound. This compound has an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Starting with the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, will also lead to the same meso-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, the **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. mCPBA, 2. H3O+ (aqueous acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The first step is the epoxidation of a cis-alkene. This syn-addition yields a meso-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane (this is the cis-epoxide).\n    *   The second step is the anti-addition opening of this meso-epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The mnemonic for this case is: **\"Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture\"**.\n    *   Let's trace this: Starting with the meso-(4R,5S)-epoxide, attack by water can occur at C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n    *   Attack at C4 inverts its configuration from R to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Attack at C5 inverts its configuration from S to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   The two products, (4S,5S)-diol and (4R,5R)-diol, are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** (50:50) of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **P+** and **P-**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol)\n2.  **P+** ((4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol)\n3.  **P-** ((4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   P+ and P- are **enantiomers**.\n*   M is a **diastereomer** of both P+ and P-.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M vs. P+/P-) have different physical properties and will thus have different retention times, leading to separate peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (like P+ and P-) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the racemic pair (P+ and P-).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Since all three compounds (M, P+, and P-) are distinct stereoisomers, they will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Enantiomers P+ and P- will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The diastereomer M will also have a different retention time from both P+ and P-.\n    *   Assuming ideal resolution, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for M, one for P+, and one for P-.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. This molecule is achiral.\n    ```\n       H     CH2CH2CH3\n        \\   /\n         C=C\n        /   \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   When an achiral trans-alkene undergoes epoxidation (a syn-addition), it forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, the attack can happen from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from one face produces the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Attack from the other face produces the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, are enantiomers.\n    *   Thus, the first step produces a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction is an anti-addition. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond, inverting the stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n    *   For a trans-epoxide, anti-addition of two -OH groups results in a meso diol.\n    *   Let's trace this:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to S) or C5 (inverting it to S). Since the molecule is symmetric, either attack gives the same product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. This product is a meso compound (it has a center of inversion and is achiral).\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to R) or C5 (inverting it to R). Either attack gives the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is the same meso compound.\n    *   A useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions on symmetrical alkenes: **Trans + Anti = Meso**. The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also achiral.\n    ```\n           H           H\n            \\         /\n             C-------C\n            /         \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The syn-addition of oxygen to the cis-alkene will form a cis-epoxide.\n    *   Because the starting (Z)-alkene is achiral and symmetric, the addition of the oxygen atom from either face results in the same single product: (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is a meso compound, specifically (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs the anti-addition ring-opening.\n    *   Starting with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxyoctane), the attack by water can occur at either C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C4 inverts its configuration (R → S), while C5 remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5 inverts its configuration (S → R), while C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers. Since the attacks at C4 and C5 are equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   The mnemonic for this is: **Cis + Anti = Racemic**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   Compound 1 is a diastereomer of both compound 2 and compound 3 (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated by an achiral column. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the HPLC will show two peaks:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The meso-diol.\n    *   **Result for standard HPLC: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It can separate enantiomers.\n    *   It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 3:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Result for chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the chemical reactions.**\n\nThe reaction sequence involves two steps:\n1.  **Epoxidation:** Treatment with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). This reagent adds a single oxygen atom across the double bond to form an epoxide. This is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen adds to one face of the alkene.\n2.  **Epoxide Ring Opening:** Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a good leaving group. A water molecule then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the back side (S_N2-like). This is an **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\nThe overall transformation is an **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stereochemistry of the products for Reaction 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral, having an internal plane of symmetry, and has stereocenters with opposite configurations (e.g., R,S).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral meso compound. Let's call it compound **M**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry of the products for Reaction 2.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have opposite configurations at all stereocenters (e.g., R,R and S,S).\n*   **Products of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **RR**) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **SS**).\n\n**Step 4: Characterize the final combined mixture.**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n1.  **M**: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound)\n2.  **RR**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n3.  **SS**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nLet's examine the relationship between these stereoisomers:\n*   **RR** and **SS** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of both **RR** and **SS**. (Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**Step 5: Predict the outcome of the standard (achiral) HPLC analysis.**\n\n*   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like **RR** and **SS**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard HPLC and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like **M** vs. the **RR/SS** pair) have different physical properties. They will have different interactions with the HPLC column and will be separated into **different peaks**.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for the racemic mixture of **RR** and **SS**.\n    *   A second, distinct peak for the meso compound **M**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC: 2 peaks.**\n\n**Step 6: Predict the outcome of the chiral HPLC analysis.**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers. It separates compounds based on the different stabilities of the transient diastereomeric complexes they form with the stationary phase.\n*   **Enantiomers** (**RR** and **SS**) will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso compound **M** is a diastereomer of **RR** and **SS**. It will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute at a time different from both **RR** and **SS**, appearing as its own **single peak**. The question states the resolution is as high as theoretically possible, meaning there will be no accidental co-elution of diastereomers.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n    *   One peak for **RR**.\n    *   A second peak for **SS**.\n    *   A third peak for **M**.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Step 7: Match the findings with the given options.**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is treated first with mCPBA and then with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This two-step sequence is a classic method for the *anti-dihydroxylation* of an alkene. The first step, epoxidation with mCPBA, is a *syn-addition*. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water, is an *anti-addition* (an Sₙ2-type attack). The net result of adding two -OH groups across the double bond is *anti*.\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** For a symmetrically substituted alkene, the stereochemical outcome follows a well-known rule: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. Undergoing anti-dihydroxylation, it will yield a single product: the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is treated with the same sequence of reagents.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also an *anti-dihydroxylation*.\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** The rule for a cis-alkene is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture of enantiomers**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. Undergoing anti-dihydroxylation, it will yield a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Characterize the Final Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three different molecules, which are all stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound, let's call it **M**).\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer, let's call it **R**).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer, let's call it **S**).\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **R**.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **S**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram for Standard (Achiral) HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, size, boiling point). The stationary phase is achiral.\n*   **Separating Stereoisomers:**\n    *   **Enantiomers (R and S)** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will interact with the achiral stationary phase in the exact same way and will have the same retention time. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers (M vs. R, and M vs. S)** have different physical properties. Therefore, the meso compound **M** will interact with the stationary phase differently than the enantiomeric pair (**R**+**S**) and will have a different retention time.\n*   **Conclusion:** The achiral HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (**M**) and one for the co-eluting enantiomers (**R**+**S**).\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram for Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the differentiation of enantiomers.\n*   **Separating Stereoisomers:**\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts with the two enantiomers (**R** and **S**) to form temporary diastereomeric complexes. Since these complexes have different energies and stabilities, the enantiomers will have different retention times and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound (**M**) is a diastereomer of **R** and **S**. As diastereomers have different physical properties, **M** will also be separated from both **R** and **S**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will be able to resolve all three stereoisomers. It will show **three peaks**: one for compound **M**, one for compound **R**, and one for compound **S**.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetric.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     H\n                 \\   /\n                  C=C\n                 /   \\\n                H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid): This is an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom is a *syn-addition*. Since the starting alkene is planar and achiral, the mCPBA can attack from either the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n        *   Attack on the trans-alkene yields a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H3O+): This causes acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide to form a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups). This ring-opening proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism, resulting in *anti-addition* of the two hydroxyl groups (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water molecule).\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti-dihydroxylation* of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The rule for anti-addition to a trans-alkene is that it produces a *meso* compound. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has stereocenters.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetric.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\   /\n                  C=C\n                 /   \\\n                H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same two-step sequence for anti-dihydroxylation is used.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The rule for anti-addition to a cis-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces two products that are enantiomers of each other: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's identify the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Separations**\n\n**A) Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical and chemical properties (like polarity, size, etc.).\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. The racemic pair of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair and will appear as a separate peak.\n*   **Conclusion for Standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the column to interact differently with the two enantiomers.\n*   Enantiomers can be separated by a chiral column because their transient interactions with the chiral stationary phase form diastereomeric complexes with different energies, leading to different retention times. Thus, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two compounds, will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute as a separate, third peak.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks (one for the meso compound, and one for each of the two enantiomers).\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and the subsequent analysis of the combined product mixture using two different types of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2      H\n                \\    /\n                 C==C\n                /    \\\n               H      CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is an epoxidation.\n    *   This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   The syn-addition to a trans-alkene results in a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, and mCPBA is treated as an achiral reagent, the epoxidation can occur from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n    *   This leads to the formation of a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   The epoxide is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This results in acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, where a water molecule opens the epoxide ring.\n    *   The mechanism is an **anti-addition** (SN2-type backside attack) of water on the protonated epoxide. The water molecule attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   So, the overall reaction sequence (epoxidation followed by acid hydrolysis) results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the original alkene.\n    *   A mnemonic for the stereochemistry is that an **E**-alkene undergoing **anti**-addition gives a **meso** product (\"**E**-**A**nti-**M**eso\").\n    *   Let's confirm this by looking at one enantiomer of the epoxide, for example, the (4R,5R) epoxide. The anti-attack of water at either C4 or C5 will lead to inversion of configuration at that center.\n        *   Attack at C4: configuration changes from R to S. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5: configuration changes from R to S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) products are the same achiral, meso compound due to a plane of symmetry. The same meso compound would be formed from the (4S,5S) epoxide.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2      CH2CH2CH3\n                \\    /\n                 C==C\n                /    \\\n               H      H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.**\n    *   Again, this is a **syn-addition**.\n    *   Syn-addition to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide.\n    *   The resulting cis-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane) has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**.\n    *   Unlike in Reaction 1, only one product is formed in this step.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.**\n    *   This is the same **anti-addition** mechanism as in Reaction 1. The overall process is **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n    *   A mnemonic for this case is that a **Z**-alkene undergoing **anti**-addition gives a **racemic** mixture (\"**Z**-**A**nti-**R**acemic\").\n    *   Let's confirm this. Starting with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S) form), the anti-attack of water occurs.\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-center): configuration inverts to S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (S-center): configuration inverts to R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   These two pathways are equally likely. The products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images; they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNow we analyze this mixture with two types of HPLC:\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns are achiral. They separate molecules based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and thus **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks:\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that interacts differently with each enantiomer.\n    *   This differential interaction allows for the **separation of enantiomers**.\n    *   It will also separate the meso compound from the chiral enantiomers, as they are diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved. The chromatogram will show three peaks:\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 3:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the reactions and the subsequent chromatographic analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Reactions\n\nThe overall process described is a two-step transformation of an alkene into a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups).\n1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** This step adds an oxygen atom across the double bond in a *syn* fashion, meaning the oxygen adds to the same face of the alkene. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (E or Z) is preserved in the resulting epoxide.\n2.  **Aqueous Acid (H3O+) Treatment:** This step performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. A water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons of the protonated epoxide ring. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, which is an *anti*-attack.\n\nThe net result of these two steps (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring opening) is the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the double bond. The two -OH groups are added to the opposite faces of the original double bond.\n\nWe can use established stereochemical rules for anti-addition to alkenes:\n\n*   **(T)rans-alkene + (A)nti-addition = (M)eso product** (if the product is capable of being meso). This is the **TAM** rule.\n*   **(C)is-alkene + (A)nti-addition = (R)acemic mixture** of enantiomers. This is the **CAR** rule.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the specific reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n\n*   Starting material: (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetric trans-alkene.\n*   Reaction: Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   Applying the **TAM** rule (Trans + Anti = Meso), the product of this reaction is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n\n*   Starting material: (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetric cis-alkene.\n*   Reaction: Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   Applying the **CAR** rule (Cis + Anti = Racemic), the product of this reaction is a **racemic mixture** of the two enantiomeric forms of octane-4,5-diol: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these three molecules:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### Step 3: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\nNow, we predict what will be observed when this three-component mixture is analyzed by two types of HPLC.\n\n**Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   This type of chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (except for their interaction with plane-polarized light or other chiral entities). Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will elute at the exact same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers**, on the other hand, have different physical properties. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, causing it to elute at a different time. It will appear as a **separate, second peak**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   This type of chromatography uses a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer in a mixture.\n*   Because of these differing interactions, the **enantiomers** ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will be separated and will elute at different times, appearing as **two distinct peaks**.\n*   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute at its own characteristic time, appearing as a **third peak**.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### Summary of Results\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the unresolved racemic pair).\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks (one for the meso compound, and one for each of the two resolved enantiomers).\n\nMatching this outcome to the given options:\nA) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the HPLC analyses:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        H       Pr\n         \\     /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n        Pr      H      (Pr = propyl, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation on the alkene. The reaction is a *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom. Since the starting material is a *trans*-alkene, the product is a *trans*-epoxide. As the starting alkene is achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** The epoxide ring is opened by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. This is an Sₙ2-like reaction where water acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the protonated epoxide's carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond. This results in an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The overall process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. There is a general rule in stereochemistry: the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene, the anti-addition of two -OH groups produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n          Pr      Pr\n           \\     /\n            C = C\n           /     \\\n          H       H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺), resulting in *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The stereochemical rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a *meso* compound (if the alkene is symmetrical, which it is).\n    *   A meso compound contains chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Note that (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) describe the same meso molecule because of its symmetry.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** The single, achiral, meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n3.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and meso-diol are **diastereomers**.\n*   (4S,5S)-diol and meso-diol are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore *cannot* be separated.

This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        H      CH2CH2CH3\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n    CH3CH2CH2  H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn-addition*, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides (the *trans*-epoxide). In this case, it produces a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons of the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the back side, resulting in an *anti-addition* of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation of Reaction 1:** The combination of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti-dihydroxylation* of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A key principle in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans* (or E) alkene results in a *meso* compound (if the alkene is symmetric).\n    *   Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, backside attack by water inverts the stereocenter it attacks, leading to the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Starting with the (4S,5S)-epoxide, backside attack leads to the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   The (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol product has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2CH2      CH2CH2CH3\n               \\    /\n                C==C\n               /    \\\n              H      H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used, resulting in an *anti-dihydroxylation*.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical principle for this case is that *anti*-addition to a *cis* (or Z) alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of two enantiomers.\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** Syn-addition of oxygen to the cis-alkene forms a single, achiral *meso*-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring opening:** Backside attack by water on the meso-epoxide leads to two different products. Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4, which is R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol. Attack at the other carbon (C5, which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol. Since both carbons are equally likely to be attacked, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these stereoisomers:\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a stereoisomer of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol, but it is not an enantiomer of either. Therefore, it is a **diastereomer** to both.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on a Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\n*   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column, eluting as separate peaks.\n*   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. It will be separated. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n*   Therefore, the chemist will observe **2 peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a distinct retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n*   Therefore, the chemist will observe **3 peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that there will be 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the HPLC analysis.\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n       H   CH2CH2CH3\n        \\ /\n         C=C\n        / \\\n CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This reaction involves the *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   Reacting a *trans*-alkene via *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides. This is because the mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face of the alkene with equal probability.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These are trans-epoxides and are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening with H₂O.** This is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups across the original double bond location (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from water). The overall reaction (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is equivalent to *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   There is a general rule in stereochemistry: *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's confirm this by tracing the mechanism:\n        *   The (4R,5R)-epoxide will open via backside attack by water. Attack at C4 gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Both (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) describe the same *meso* compound, as the molecule has propyl groups on both sides, allowing for a center of inversion and making it achiral.\n        *   Similarly, the (4S,5S)-epoxide will also exclusively yield the same *meso*-diol upon hydrolysis.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, the *meso*-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n         H      H\n          \\    /\n           C==C\n          /    \\\n   CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   *Syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *meso* epoxide. This is because a plane of symmetry is maintained throughout the reaction.\n    *   The product is the single, achiral *meso*-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening with H₂O.** This is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   The general rule is: *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *racemic* mixture of two enantiomers.\n    *   Let's confirm with the mechanism:\n        *   The *meso*-epoxide (achiral) is protonated. Water, an achiral nucleophile, attacks. Because the starting materials (meso-epoxide and water) are achiral, if the products are chiral, they must be formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n        *   Attack at the two different carbons of the protonated epoxide leads to the formation of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **E1**) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (let's call it **E2**).\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n*   **M:** *meso*-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   **E1:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **E2:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nWhat are the relationships between these isomers?\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of both **E1** and **E2**.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers (**M** vs. **E1**/**E2**) have different physical properties and will separate.\n    *   Enantiomers (**E1** vs. **E2**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not separate. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks: one for compound **M**, and one for the co-eluting enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing them to be separated.\n    *   It will separate the diastereomers (**M** from **E1** and **E2**).\n    *   It will also separate the enantiomers **E1** from **E2**.\n    *   Since all three compounds (**M**, **E1**, **E2**) are chemically distinct and can be resolved by a chiral column, the chromatogram will show three separate peaks.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral due to a C2 axis of symmetry perpendicular to the double bond.\n    ```\n       H         H\n        \\       /\n         C === C\n        /       \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom across the double bond is a **syn-addition**. For a trans-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation can occur from either face of the alkene with equal probability, leading to a racemic mixture of the two possible enantiomeric epoxides.\n        *   Product of this step: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This step causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This reaction proceeds via an **anti-addition** mechanism (SN2-like backside attack).\n        *   Let's consider the opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Anti-attack by water at either C4 or C5 will lead to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Similarly, the opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide by anti-attack will also lead to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two resulting products, (4R,5S)-diol and (4S,5R)-diol, are identical. This molecule has two stereocenters but is achiral because it has a center of inversion (and a plane of symmetry in a specific conformation). This type of compound is called a **meso compound**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n    CH3CH2CH2     H\n        \\       /\n         C === C\n        /       \\\n       H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** The syn-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the product is cis-4,5-epoxyoctane. This molecule has stereocenters (4R, 5S), but it is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry. It is a **meso compound**.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** The acid-catalyzed, anti-addition ring-opening of the meso-epoxide.\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-configuration) inverts its configuration to S. The other center (C5, S-configuration) is unchanged. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at the equivalent C5 (S-configuration) inverts its configuration to R. The other center (C4, R-configuration) is unchanged. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   The two products, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are **enantiomers**. Since the attack on the two carbons of the symmetric meso-epoxide is equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are enantiomers.\n*   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\nThe problem states that the resolution is as high as theoretically possible.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and separate into distinct peaks.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the achiral column will separate the meso-diol from the enantiomeric pair. The enantiomers themselves will not be separated.\n    *   **Result:** Two peaks will be observed.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column can separate all molecules that are not identical. This includes constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n    *   Our mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers: the meso compound and the two enantiomers. All three will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso-diol will be separated from the other two (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated from each other.\n    *   **Result:** Three peaks will be observed.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks in standard HPLC.**\n*   **3 peaks in chiral HPLC.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
