Energy Eigenvalues\n\nThe energy eigenvalues of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nFor the three-dimensional isotropic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy eigenvalues can then be written as:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### 3. Finding the Third Excited State Energy\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** $n = 0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n = 1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n = 2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n = 3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Degeneracy\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same energy. This means we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we need to find the number of combinations such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. Let's list them:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) - **3 states**\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) - **6 states**\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1) - **1 state**\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option C.

For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3.\n\n    This is a combinatorial problem. We can solve it by listing the possibilities or by using the \"stars and bars\" formula. The degeneracy $g_n$ for the $n$-th energy level in a $D$-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by:\n    $g_n = \\binom{n+D-1}{n} = \\binom{n+D-1}{D-1}$\n\n    For our case, $n=3$ and the dimension $D=3$.\n    $g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2}$\n    $g_3 = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$\n\n    Alternatively, we can list the combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$:\n    *   Type (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) -> 3 states\n    *   Type (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) -> 6 states\n    *   Type (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) -> 1 state\n    Total number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    So, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy of the third excited state.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10.
