The relationship between the populations of different energy levels and temperature is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy levels, `i` and `j`, as follows:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in the higher energy state `j` and lower energy state `i`, respectively.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the two levels, which we can denote as `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to each star:**\n    Let the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number of atoms in the lower state be `R`.\n\n    For star_1 (with temperature T_1):\n    R_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n    For star_2 (with temperature T_2):\n    R_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This translates to:\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship:**\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, `(g_j / g_i)`, is the same for both stars since it's the same atomic transition. Therefore, it can be canceled from both sides:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the relationship between the temperatures:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to solve for `ln(2)`.\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n9.  **Factor and simplify the expression:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`.\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n10. **Analyze the numerical values:** The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE` as approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant, `k`, is known to be `1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. The problem is set up such that the numerical value of `ΔE` in Joules is essentially equal to the numerical value of `k` in J/K. This means the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1 (with units of Kelvin, which makes the whole right side of the equation dimensionless, as required since `ln(2)` is dimensionless).\n\n    Therefore, we can substitute `ΔE / k ≈ 1 K` into our derived equation. The options provided do not contain the `ΔE/k` term, which confirms that we are expected to make this simplification.\n\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:** This result matches option C.\n\n    A) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n    C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\nThe correct equation is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms `N_b` in an excited state with energy `E_b` to the number of atoms `N_a` in a lower state with energy `E_a` is given by:\n    `N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]`\n    where:\n    *   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Translate the problem statement into equations:**\n    *   We are comparing the same energy levels in two different stars, so the terms `g_b`, `g_a`, and `ΔE` are the same for both.\n    *   Let `T_1` be the temperature of star_1 and `T_2` be the temperature of star_2.\n    *   The population ratio for star_1 is: `(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n    *   The population ratio for star_2 is: `(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n    *   The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to... star_2.\" This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the lower state in star_1 is twice the same ratio in star_2.\n    *   Therefore, `(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2`.\n\n4.  **Combine the equations and solve:**\n    *   Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from the problem:\n        `(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n    *   The degeneracy term `(g_b / g_a)` is on both sides and cancels out:\n        `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n    *   To solve for the temperatures, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        `ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n    *   Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n        `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n        `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n        `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    *   Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis by finding a common denominator `(T_1 * T_2)`:\n        `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n5.  **Analyze the result and compare with the options:**\n    *   The problem provides `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    *   Therefore, the pre-factor `ΔE / k` is approximately `(1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`.\n    *   Substituting this into our derived equation gives:\n        `ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    *   Now let's examine the options provided:\n        A) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n        B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n        C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n        D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n    *   Our derived equation has the exact same algebraic form for the temperature dependence as option B: `(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`.\n    *   The option B is written without the `(1 K)` constant factor.

Since the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use this equation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The distribution of atoms among different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. For two energy levels, an excited state (let's call it state 2) and a ground state (state 1), the ratio of the number of atoms in these states is given by:\n    `N_2 / N_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N_2` and `N_1` are the number of atoms in the excited and ground states, respectively.\n    *   `g_2` and `g_1` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `E_2 - E_1` is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Interpret the problem statement:** The phrase \"iron atoms... are twice as excited\" compares the level of excitation in star_1 to that in star_2. A standard measure for the level of excitation is the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_2 / N_1`).\n    Let `R = N_2 / N_1`. The problem states that this ratio for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2:\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star:**\n    For star_1 (with temperature `T_1`):\n    `R_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\n    For star_2 (with temperature `T_2`):\n    `R_2 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Set up the equation based on the given ratio:**\n    Substitute the expressions for `R_1` and `R_2` into the relation `R_1 = 2 * R_2`:\n    `(g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, `(g_2 / g_1)`, is the same for both stars as it relates to the specific energy levels of the iron atom, not the star. So, it cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    Now, divide both sides by `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2`\n\n    Using the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n    `exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ) = 2`\n    `exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) + ΔE / (k * T_2) ) = 2`\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ) = 2`\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures:** Take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides to remove the exponential:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\n    Combine the terms in the parenthesis using a common denominator:\n    `1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n    So the equation becomes:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n7.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n    The problem is set up so that this pre-factor `ΔE / k` simplifies to 1.\n\n8.  **Final Equation:** Substitute this value back into the equation:\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis resulting equation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. Since the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use this equation.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in an excited state `j` to the number in a lower energy state `i`:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j`, `N_i`: Number of atoms in state `j` and state `i`, respectively.\n*   `g_j`, `g_i`: Statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the energy levels `j` and `i`. This is a property of the atom itself.\n*   `E_j`, `E_i`: Energies of the states `j` and `i`.\n*   `ΔE = E_j - E_i`: The energy difference between the two states.\n*   `k`: The Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T`: The temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Applying the Equation to the Two Stars**\n\nLet's denote the ratio of the number of atoms in the specific excited state (`N_e`) to the number in the ground state (`N_g`) as `R`.\n\nFor star_1 (with temperature T_1):\nR_1 = (N_e / N_g)_1 = (g_e / g_g) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star_2 (with temperature T_2):\nR_2 = (N_e / N_g)_2 = (g_e / g_g) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means:\nR_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n**3.

This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n\n`(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2`\n\nNow we can substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship:\n\n`(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]]`\n\nThe term `(g_j / g_i)` cancels out from both sides:\n\n`exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n### 4. Solving for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2\n\nTo solve this equation, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n`ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x):\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n`ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parentheses by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n### 5.

We need the value of the Boltzmann constant, `k`.\n    The Boltzmann constant `k` is approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    Therefore, the ratio `(ΔE / k)` is:\n    `(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n    The problem is designed so that this pre-factor is equal to 1.\n\n12. **Final Equation:** Substitute this value back into the equation from step 10:\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n13. **Compare with the options:** This result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars.

A natural measure of the excitation to a specific level `i` is the ratio of its population (`N_i`) to the population of the ground state (`N_ground`). Let's denote this excitation ratio as `X = N_i / N_ground`.\n\n3.  **Applying to the Two Stars**: We can write the excitation ratio for each star using the Boltzmann equation. Let `T_1` and `T_2` be the temperatures of star 1 and star 2, respectively. We are considering the same energy level transition in the same atomic species (iron), so the statistical weights (`g_i`, `g_ground`) and the energy difference `ΔE` are the same for both stars.\n\n    *   For star 1: `X_1 = (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n    *   For star 2: `X_2 = (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n4.  **Using the Given Information**: The problem states that `X_1 = 2 * X_2`. Substituting the expressions from step 3:\n\n    ```\n    (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    ```\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Equation**: The term with the statistical weights `(g_i / g_ground)` is a common factor on both sides and can be canceled out:\n\n    ```\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    ```\n\n6.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: To isolate the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    ```\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    ```\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n    ```\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n    ```\n\n7.  **Isolating ln(2)**: We rearrange the equation to match the format of the given options:\n\n    ```\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n    ```\n\n8.  **Factoring and Finalizing**: We can factor out the `ΔE / k` term and combine the fractions involving temperature:\n\n    ```\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ```\n\n9.  **Evaluating the Constant Factor**: The problem provides `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.

Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n\n    ```\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K\n    ```\n    The problem is designed such that this pre-factor is essentially 1. Substituting this value into our equation:\n\n    ```\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ```\n    This simplifies to:\n    ```\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    ```\n\nThis equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars.\n\n**1.

Formulate the Relationship**\n\nNow, we can take the ratio of the excitation equations for the two stars:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = [ (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] / [ (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\nThe constant term `(g_i / g_0)` cancels out:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\nUsing the rule of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp( [-ΔE / (k * T_1)] - [-ΔE / (k * T_2)] )`\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) + ΔE / (k * T_2) )`\n\nFactoring out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) )`\n\n**6. Substitute Known Values and Simplify**\n\nWe know `R_1 / R_2 = 2`. Substituting this into the equation:\n\n`2 = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) )`\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\nNow, combine the fractions in the parenthesis using a common denominator `(T_1 * T_2)`:\n\n`1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**7.

The key assumption is that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the relative population of atomic energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Recall the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states, an excited state (level i) and a lower energy state (level j).\n\n    N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    Where:\n    *   N_i, N_j are the number of atoms in states i and j.\n    *   g_i, g_j are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   ΔE = E_i - E_j is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:** Let's write the Boltzmann equation for the specific energy level in Star 1 (with temperature T_1) and Star 2 (with temperature T_2). We are comparing the same energy levels of the same element (iron), so the statistical weights (g_i, g_j) and the energy difference (ΔE) are the same for both stars.\n\n    *   For Star 1:  (N_i / N_j)_1 = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For Star 2:  (N_i / N_j)_2 = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Observational Data:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... compared to... star_2.\" This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for Star 1.\n\n    (N_i / N_j)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_j)_2\n\n    (Note: A higher excitation ratio implies a higher temperature, so we expect T_1 > T_2.)\n\n5.  **Set up the Equation and Solve:** Now, substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 4.\n\n    (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n    The statistical weight term (g_i / g_j) is on both sides, so it cancels out:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    To solve for the temperatures, we need to get them out of the exponent.

Let's call this the \"excitation ratio\", $R$.\n\n    *   For star 1, with temperature $T_1$, the excitation ratio is:\n        $ R_1 = \\frac{N_{exc,1}}{N_{g,1}} = \\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)} $\n\n    *   For star 2, with temperature $T_2$, the excitation ratio is:\n        $ R_2 = \\frac{N_{exc,2}}{N_{g,2}} = \\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)} $\n\n    The problem states that atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means:\n    $ R_1 = 2 \\times R_2 $\n\n3.  **Setting up the Equation**: We can now set up an equation by dividing $R_1$ by $R_2$:\n\n    $ \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{\\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}}{\\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}} = 2 $\n\n    The statistical weights $g_{exc}$ and $g_{g}$ are properties of the iron atom and are the same regardless of the star, so they cancel out:\n\n    $ \\frac{e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}}{e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}} = 2 $\n\n4.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: Now, we solve this equation for the relationship between $T_1$ and $T_2$.\n\n    *   Using the property of exponents, $e^a / e^b = e^{a-b}$:\n        $ e^{(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1}) - (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2})} = 2 $\n        $ e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1})} = 2 $\n\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        $ \\ln(e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1})}) = \\ln(2) $\n        $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}) = \\ln(2) $\n\n    *   Combine the terms in the parentheses by finding a common denominator ($T_1 T_2$):\n        $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n\n5.  **Using the Given Numerical Values**: The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference, $\\Delta E = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant is $k_B \\approx 1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\n    The values given in the problem are set up so that their ratio is approximately 1:\n    $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} = 1 \\text{ K} $\n\n6.  **Final Equation**: Substituting this value back into our derived equation:\n\n    $ (1) \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n    $ \\ln(2) = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $\n\nThis matches option B. A physical check confirms this is correct: since star 1 is \"more excited\" ($R_1 > R_2$), its temperature must be higher ($T_1 > T_2$). The equation $\\ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2)/(T_1T_2)$ is consistent with this, as $\\ln(2)$ is positive, requiring $T_1 - T_2$ to be positive.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe user wants me to identify the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of two stars, $T_1$ and $T_2$, based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres.\n\n**1.

The relationship between the populations of different energy levels and temperature is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy levels, `i` and `j`, as follows:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in the higher energy state `j` and lower energy state `i`, respectively.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the two levels, which we can denote as `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to each star:**\n    Let the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number of atoms in the lower state be `R`.\n\n    For star_1 (with temperature T_1):\n    R_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n    For star_2 (with temperature T_2):\n    R_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This translates to:\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship:**\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, `(g_j / g_i)`, is the same for both stars since it's the same atomic transition. Therefore, it can be canceled from both sides:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the relationship between the temperatures:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to solve for `ln(2)`.\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n9.  **Factor and simplify the expression:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`.\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n10. **Analyze the numerical values:** The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE` as approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`.

For two energy levels, an excited state (let's call it state 2) and a ground state (state 1), the ratio of the number of atoms in these states is given by:\n    `N_2 / N_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-(E_2 - E_1) / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N_2` and `N_1` are the number of atoms in the excited and ground states, respectively.\n    *   `g_2` and `g_1` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `E_2 - E_1` is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Interpret the problem statement:** The phrase \"iron atoms... are twice as excited\" compares the level of excitation in star_1 to that in star_2. A standard measure for the level of excitation is the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_2 / N_1`).\n    Let `R = N_2 / N_1`. The problem states that this ratio for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2:\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star:**\n    For star_1 (with temperature `T_1`):\n    `R_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\n    For star_2 (with temperature `T_2`):\n    `R_2 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Set up the equation based on the given ratio:**\n    Substitute the expressions for `R_1` and `R_2` into the relation `R_1 = 2 * R_2`:\n    `(g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, `(g_2 / g_1)`, is the same for both stars as it relates to the specific energy levels of the iron atom, not the star. So, it cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    Now, divide both sides by `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2`\n\n    Using the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n    `exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ) = 2`\n    `exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) + ΔE / (k * T_2) ) = 2`\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ) = 2`\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures:** Take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides to remove the exponential:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\n    Combine the terms in the parenthesis using a common denominator:\n    `1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n    So the equation becomes:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n7.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n    The problem is set up so that this pre-factor `ΔE / k` simplifies to 1.\n\n8.  **Final Equation:** Substitute this value back into the equation:\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis resulting equation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.

Therefore, it cancels out:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n**4. Solving for the Temperatures**\n\nTo solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x):\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the terms to isolate ln(2):\n\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parentheses:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n**5.

The problem states that the stellar photospheres can be assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which justifies the use of this equation.\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels, say a higher energy state 'j' and a lower energy state 'i':\n\n`N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]`\n\nwhere:\n*   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in energy states j and i.\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of those energy levels.\n*   `E_j` and `E_i` are the energies of the states. The difference `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels, denoted as `ΔE`.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Applying the Equation to the Two Stars\n\nWe are given two stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures T_1 and T_2, respectively. We are considering the same transition of iron atoms in both stars, so the terms `g_j`, `g_i`, and `ΔE` are the same for both.\n\nFor star_1 (temperature T_1):\n`(N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n\nFor star_2 (temperature T_2):\n`(N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n### 3. Using the Given Information\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n\n`(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2`\n\nNow we can substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship:\n\n`(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]]`\n\nThe term `(g_j / g_i)` cancels out from both sides:\n\n`exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n### 4. Solving for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2\n\nTo solve this equation, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n`ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x):\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n`ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parentheses by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n### 5. Substituting the Numerical Values\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference `ΔE = 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Let's compute the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\n`ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\nThe problem is designed such that this ratio simplifies to 1. Substituting this value back into our derived equation:\n\n`ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n### 6.

Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state 'b' ($N_b$) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state 'a' ($N_a$) is given by:\n    $N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T))$\n    where:\n    *   $g_b$ and $g_a$ are the degeneracies (statistical weights) of the energy levels.\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_b - E_a$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Translate the problem statement into an equation:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of populations ($N_b/N_a$) for the given energy levels in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let $T_1$ be the temperature of star_1 and $T_2$ be the temperature of star_2. We can write this as:\n    $(N_b / N_a)_{star\\_1} = 2 \\times (N_b / N_a)_{star\\_2}$\n\n4.  **Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star:**\n    *   For star 1 (temperature $T_1$):\n        $(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))$\n    *   For star 2 (temperature $T_2$):\n        $(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 3:**\n    $(g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_b / g_a) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)) ]$\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term $(g_b/g_a)$ represents the properties of the specific iron transition and is the same for both stars. Therefore, it can be cancelled from both sides of the equation:\n    $exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    $ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n\n    Using the logarithm properties $ln(e^x) = x$ and $ln(a \\cdot b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$:\n    $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n    $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_2)$\n\n8.  **Isolate the ln(2) term:** Rearrange the equation to solve for $ln(2)$:\n    $ln(2) = \\Delta E / (k * T_2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_1)$\n\n9.  **Factor and combine terms:** Factor out the common term $\\Delta E / k$ and combine the fractions involving temperature:\n    $ln(2) = (\\Delta E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)$\n    $ln(2) = (\\Delta E / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]$\n\n10. **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference, $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant is $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\n    Calculate the ratio $\\Delta E / k$:\n    $\\Delta E / k \\approx (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}) / (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}) \\approx 1 \\text{ K}$\n\n    Substituting this value into our equation:\n    $ln(2) = (1 \\text{ K}) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]$\n\n    This step is slightly confusing with units, but in the exponent term $-\\Delta E/(kT)$, the units must cancel. So if $\\Delta E$ is in Joules and $T$ is in Kelvin, $k$ must be in J/K. The quantity $\\Delta E/k$ has units of Kelvin. The term in the parentheses $(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)$ has units of $1/K$. The product is therefore dimensionless, which is correct since $ln(2)$ is a dimensionless number. The numerical value of the factor $\\Delta E/k$ is 1.\n\n    So, the final equation is:\n    $ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]$\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:** The derived equation matches option D.\n\nA) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect.\nB) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect.\nC) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect.\nD) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem relates the population of atomic energy levels to temperature.

The key physical principle is the Boltzmann distribution, which is applicable here because the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: Under LTE, the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state `i` (`N_i`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `j` (`N_j`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n    ```\n    N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T)]\n    ```\n\n    where:\n    *   `g_i` and `g_j` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_i - E_j` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Defining \"Excitation\"**: The problem states that \"iron atoms...are twice as excited in a specific energy level\" in star 1 compared to star 2. A natural measure of the excitation to a specific level `i` is the ratio of its population (`N_i`) to the population of the ground state (`N_ground`). Let's denote this excitation ratio as `X = N_i / N_ground`.\n\n3.  **Applying to the Two Stars**: We can write the excitation ratio for each star using the Boltzmann equation. Let `T_1` and `T_2` be the temperatures of star 1 and star 2, respectively. We are considering the same energy level transition in the same atomic species (iron), so the statistical weights (`g_i`, `g_ground`) and the energy difference `ΔE` are the same for both stars.\n\n    *   For star 1: `X_1 = (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n    *   For star 2: `X_2 = (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n4.  **Using the Given Information**: The problem states that `X_1 = 2 * X_2`. Substituting the expressions from step 3:\n\n    ```\n    (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    ```\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Equation**: The term with the statistical weights `(g_i / g_ground)` is a common factor on both sides and can be canceled out:\n\n    ```\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    ```\n\n6.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: To isolate the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    ```\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    ```\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n    ```\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n    ```\n\n7.  **Isolating ln(2)**: We rearrange the equation to match the format of the given options:\n\n    ```\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n    ```\n\n8.  **Factoring and Finalizing**: We can factor out the `ΔE / k` term and combine the fractions involving temperature:\n\n    ```\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ```\n\n9.  **Evaluating the Constant Factor**: The problem provides `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n\n    ```\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K\n    ```\n    The problem is designed such that this pre-factor is essentially 1. Substituting this value into our equation:\n\n    ```\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ```\n    This simplifies to:\n    ```\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    ```\n\nThis equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem involves the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars.

The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms `N_i` in an excited energy state `i` to the number of atoms `N_j` in a lower energy state `j`:\n\n`N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_i`, `N_j` are the number of atoms in states `i` and `j`.\n*   `g_i`, `g_j` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of those states.\n*   `E_i`, `E_j` are the energies of the states.\n*   `ΔE = E_i - E_j` is the energy difference between the states.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nIn this problem, we are comparing the \"excitation\" of iron atoms. This typically refers to the ratio of the population of an excited state (`N_i`) to the population of the ground state (`N_0`). So we will use state `j` as the ground state.\n\nThe equation for the excitation level `R` is:\n`R = N_i / N_0 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\n**3. Apply the Equation to Both Stars**\n\nWe apply this formula to both star_1 (with temperature T_1) and star_2 (with temperature T_2).\n\n*   For star_1: `R_1 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n*   For star_2: `R_2 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\nThe energy levels (`E_i`, `E_0`), the energy difference (`ΔE`), and the statistical weights (`g_i`, `g_0`) are properties of the iron atom, so they are the same for both stars.\n\n**4.

Formulate the Relationship**\n\nNow, we can take the ratio of the excitation equations for the two stars:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = [ (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] / [ (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\nThe constant term `(g_i / g_0)` cancels out:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\nUsing the rule of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp( [-ΔE / (k * T_1)] - [-ΔE / (k * T_2)] )`\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) + ΔE / (k * T_2) )`\n\nFactoring out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) )`\n\n**6. Substitute Known Values and Simplify**\n\nWe know `R_1 / R_2 = 2`. Substituting this into the equation:\n\n`2 = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) )`\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\nNow, combine the fractions in the parenthesis using a common denominator `(T_1 * T_2)`:\n\n`1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**7.

However, looking at the answer choices, they are presented as dimensionless equations. This implies a simplification where this factor is treated as a numerical value of 1. This is a common practice in physics problems where characteristic scales are used.\n\nSubstituting `ΔE / k = 1` into our derived equation:\n\n`ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**8.

Since the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use this equation.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms ($N_i$) in an energy state $i$ to the number of atoms ($N_j$) in an energy state $j$ is given by:\n\n    $ \\frac{N_i}{N_j} = \\frac{g_i}{g_j} e^{(-(E_i - E_j))/(k_B T)} $\n\n    where:\n    *   $g_i$ and $g_j$ are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the energy levels $i$ and $j$.\n    *   $E_i - E_j = \\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the Problem Statement**: The phrase \"atoms... are twice as excited\" refers to the ratio of the population of a specific excited energy level to the population of a reference level (typically the ground state). Let's call this the \"excitation ratio\", $R$.\n\n    *   For star 1, with temperature $T_1$, the excitation ratio is:\n        $ R_1 = \\frac{N_{exc,1}}{N_{g,1}} = \\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)} $\n\n    *   For star 2, with temperature $T_2$, the excitation ratio is:\n        $ R_2 = \\frac{N_{exc,2}}{N_{g,2}} = \\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)} $\n\n    The problem states that atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means:\n    $ R_1 = 2 \\times R_2 $\n\n3.  **Setting up the Equation**: We can now set up an equation by dividing $R_1$ by $R_2$:\n\n    $ \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{\\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}}{\\frac{g_{exc}}{g_{g}} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}} = 2 $\n\n    The statistical weights $g_{exc}$ and $g_{g}$ are properties of the iron atom and are the same regardless of the star, so they cancel out:\n\n    $ \\frac{e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}}{e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}} = 2 $\n\n4.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: Now, we solve this equation for the relationship between $T_1$ and $T_2$.\n\n    *   Using the property of exponents, $e^a / e^b = e^{a-b}$:\n        $ e^{(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1}) - (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2})} = 2 $\n        $ e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1})} = 2 $\n\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        $ \\ln(e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1})}) = \\ln(2) $\n        $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}) = \\ln(2) $\n\n    *   Combine the terms in the parentheses by finding a common denominator ($T_1 T_2$):\n        $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n\n5.  **Using the Given Numerical Values**: The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference, $\\Delta E = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant is $k_B \\approx 1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\n    The values given in the problem are set up so that their ratio is approximately 1:\n    $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} = 1 \\text{ K} $\n\n6.  **Final Equation**: Substituting this value back into our derived equation:\n\n    $ (1) \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n    $ \\ln(2) = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $\n\nThis matches option B. A physical check confirms this is correct: since star 1 is \"more excited\" ($R_1 > R_2$), its temperature must be higher ($T_1 > T_2$). The equation $\\ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2)/(T_1T_2)$ is consistent with this, as $\\ln(2)$ is positive, requiring $T_1 - T_2$ to be positive.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe user wants me to identify the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of two stars, $T_1$ and $T_2$, based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\nThe problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a key piece of information because it allows us to use the Boltzmann distribution to describe the population of atoms in different energy levels.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms ($N_j$, $N_i$) in two energy states ($E_j$, $E_i$):\n$$ \\frac{N_j}{N_i} = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\frac{(E_j - E_i)}{kT}} $$\nwhere:\n*   $g_j$ and $g_i$ are the statistical weights of the states (these are constant for a given transition).\n*   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n*   $\\Delta E = E_j - E_i$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n\n**2. Formulate Equations for Each Star**\nLet $R_1$ be the ratio of the number of excited atoms to the number of atoms in a lower state for star_1, and $R_2$ be the same ratio for star_2.\n\nFor star_1 (temperature $T_1$):\n$$ R_1 = \\left(\\frac{g_j}{g_i}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}} $$\nFor star_2 (temperature $T_2$):\n$$ R_2 = \\left(\\frac{g_j}{g_i}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}} $$\nThe term $\\frac{g_j}{g_i}$ is a constant for the specific energy levels of the iron atom being considered, so it's the same for both stars.\n\n**3. Use the Observational Data**\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited ... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n$$ R_1 = 2 \\cdot R_2 $$\nSince $R$ is an exponential function of temperature, this implies that star_1 must be hotter than star_2 ($T_1 > T_2$) to have a higher population in the excited state.\n\nNow, substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{g_j}{g_i}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{g_j}{g_i}\\right) e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}} $$\nThe constant term $\\left(\\frac{g_j}{g_i}\\right)$ cancels out from both sides:\n$$ e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}} $$\n**4. Solve for the Relationship between Temperatures**\nTo solve for $T_1$ and $T_2$, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(2 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}\\right) $$\nUsing the logarithm properties $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$ and $\\ln(e^x) = x$:\n$$ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) + \\ln\\left(e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}\\right) $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) - \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2} $$\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\ln(2)$ term:\n$$ \\ln(2) = \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} $$\nFactor out the common term $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$:\n$$ \\ln(2) = \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) $$\n**5. Substitute the Given Values**\nThe problem provides the following values:\n*   Energy difference, $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n*   The Boltzmann constant, $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\nThe ratio $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$ is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} = 1 \\text{ K} $$\n(The problem was designed to make this calculation simple).\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation:\n$$ \\ln(2) = 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) $$\nNow, combine the fractions inside the parentheses by finding a common denominator ($T_1 T_2$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{T_1}{T_1 T_2} - \\frac{T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $$\nSo, the final relationship is:\n$$ \\ln(2) = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $$\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
