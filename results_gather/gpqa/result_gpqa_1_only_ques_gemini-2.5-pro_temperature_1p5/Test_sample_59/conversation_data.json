    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. We need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) and compare it to their lifespan.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   Speed of the spacecraft (v) = 0.99999987 * c\n*   Astronaut's age at departure = 22 years\n*   Average lifespan of the aliens = 150 years\n*   Destination: Earth, from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\n\n**2. Determine the distance:**\nFirst, we need the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The distance to the LMC is not fixed with perfect precision and various sources cite values between 157,000 and 169,000 light-years. Based on the options provided, a distance of approximately **159,000 light-years** is the value intended for this problem. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year.\n\n**3. Calculate the travel time in Earth's reference frame (t):**\nThis is the time that would be measured by an observer on Earth. We can calculate this using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.\n*   t = 159,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n*   Since a light-year is c * 1 year, the 'c' cancels out.\n*   t = 159,000 years / 0.99999987\n*   t ≈ 159,000.02 years\n\nSo, from Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 159,000 years.\n\n**4. Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (t'):**\nDue to time dilation, time passes much slower for the astronaut traveling near the speed of light. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nt' = t * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere:\n*   t' is the proper time (astronaut's time)\n*   t is the time in the stationary frame (Earth's time)\n*   v is the velocity of the spacecraft\n*   c is the speed of light\n\nLet's first calculate the time dilation factor, √(1 - v²/c²):\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   (v/c)² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) = √0.00000026 ≈ 0.0005099\n\nNow, we can find the astronaut's time (t'):\n*   t' = 159,000.02 years * 0.0005099\n*   t' ≈ 81.07 years\n\n**5. Determine if the astronaut survives:**\nThe journey will take approximately 81 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n*   Astronaut's age upon arrival = Initial Age + Journey Time\n*   Astronaut's age upon arrival = 22 years + 81 years = 103 years\n\nSince the astronaut's age upon arrival (103 years) is less than their species' average lifetime (150 years), the astronaut will survive the journey. This eliminates option D.\n\nThe calculated journey time of approximately 81 years matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
