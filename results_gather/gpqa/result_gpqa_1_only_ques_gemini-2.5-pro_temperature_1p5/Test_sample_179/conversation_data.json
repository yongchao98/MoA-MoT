    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nWe have an isolated system of 13 identical particles.\n*   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`e ≈ 1.602 x 10^-19 C`).\n*   The mass is negligible, so we only consider electrostatic potential energy.\n*   One particle (let's call it the central charge, `q_c`) is fixed at a point P.\n*   The other 12 particles (surface charges, `q_s`) are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m`, centered at P.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum possible total potential energy of this system.\n\n**2. Formulate the Total Potential Energy**\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy `U_total` of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies for all unique pairs of charges. We can split this into two parts:\n1.  The interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 surface charges (`U_center-surface`).\n2.  The interaction energy among the 12 surface charges themselves (`U_surface-surface`).\n\n`U_total = U_center-surface + U_surface-surface`\n\n**3. Calculate `U_center-surface`**\n\nThe central charge `q_c = 2e` is at a distance `R` from each of the 12 surface charges `q_s = 2e`. The potential energy of interaction for each such pair is `k * q_c * q_s / R`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`k ≈ 8.98755 x 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2`).\n\nSince there are 12 such pairs, this component of the energy is:\n`U_center-surface = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\nThis value is fixed because `k, q, R` are all constant. It does not depend on the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n**4. Minimize `U_surface-surface`**\n\nTo find the minimum total energy of the system, we need to minimize `U_surface-surface`. This energy component is given by:\n`U_surface-surface = Σ_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ 12} k * q^2 / r_ij`\nwhere `r_ij` is the distance between the i-th and j-th surface charges.\n\nTo minimize this energy, the repulsive charges must arrange themselves to be as far apart from each other as possible. This is a classic physics problem known as the **Thomson problem**. For N=12 charges on a sphere, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron**.\n\n**5. Calculate `U_surface-surface` for an Icosahedron**\n\nFor 12 charges at the vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R, we need to sum the reciprocal distances for all `12 * 11 / 2 = 66` pairs. The distances between vertices of an icosahedron fall into three categories:\n*   `d_1`: The distance to the 5 nearest neighbors (edge length of the icosahedron). There are `12 * 5 / 2 = 30` such pairs.\n*   `d_2`: The distance to the 5 second-nearest neighbors. There are `12 * 5 / 2 = 30` such pairs.\n*   `d_3`: The distance to the single antipodal vertex. `d_3 = 2R`. There are `12 / 2 = 6` such pairs.\n\nFrom geometric analysis of the icosahedron, the reciprocal distances scaled by `R` are known to be:\n*   `R / d_1 = sin(72°)`\n*   `R / d_2 = sin(36°)`\n*   `R / d_3 = 1/2`\n\nWe can write `U_surface-surface` as:\n`U_surface-surface = (k * q^2 / R) * [30 * (R/d_1) + 30 * (R/d_2) + 6 * (R/d_3)]`\nLet `S` be the dimensionless sum in the brackets:\n`S = 30 * sin(72°) + 30 * sin(36°) + 6 * (1/2)`\n`S = 30 * (sin(72°) + sin(36°)) + 3`\nUsing the values `sin(72°) ≈ 0.95106` and `sin(36°) ≈ 0.58779`:\n`S ≈ 30 * (0.95106 + 0.58779) + 3 = 30 * (1.53885) + 3 = 46.1655 + 3 = 49.1655`\n\nSo, `U_surface-surface = S * (k * q^2 / R) ≈ 49.166 * (k * q^2 / R)`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Minimum Energy**\n\nNow, we combine the two energy components:\n`U_total = U_center-surface + U_surface-surface`\n`U_total = 12 * (k * q^2 / R) + S * (k * q^2 / R)`\n`U_total = (12 + S) * (k * q^2 / R)`\n`U_total ≈ (12 + 49.166) * (k * q^2 / R) = 61.166 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\nNow, we plug in the physical constants:\n*   `q = 2e = 2 * 1.602177 × 10^-19 C = 3.204354 × 10^-19 C`\n*   `q^2 ≈ 1.026787 × 10^-37 C^2`\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n\nCalculate the term `(k * q^2 / R)`:\n`(k * q^2 / R) = (8.98755 × 10^9 * 1.026787 × 10^-37) / 2`\n`≈ (9.2285 × 10^-28) / 2 ≈ 4.61425 × 10^-28 J`\n\nFinally, calculate the total energy:\n`U_total ≈ 61.166 * (4.61425 × 10^-28 J)`\n`U_total ≈ 282.206 × 10^-28 J`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82206 × 10^-26 J`\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe minimum energy of the system, when rounded to three decimal places, is `2.822 x 10^-26 J`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
