    "This problem can be solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relation is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state. This is often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" of the state.\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor calculation purposes, we can use the approximation:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\n\nWe need to calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each of the two quantum states.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Condition for Resolving the Energy Levels**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than or comparable to the widths, the two energy levels will overlap and appear as a single, broad level.\n\nThe broader of the two levels is State 1, with an energy width of ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, for the levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be much larger than this value.\n\nRequired condition: |E₁ - E₂| >> ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's check which of the given options satisfies this condition:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would not be resolved.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would not be clearly resolved.\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much, much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would not be resolved.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is significantly larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ is about 150 times larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷). This separation is large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV would allow the two quantum states to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<D>>>"
