    "This problem requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths in the same environment (i.e., same gas number density $n$, which is determined by pressure $P$ and temperature $T$).\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules ($\\lambda_1$)**:\n    This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. Since all molecules are in random thermal motion, we must consider their relative velocities. The standard formula from the kinetic theory of gases for molecules of the same species is:\n    $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_{gas}}$\n    where:\n    *   $n$ is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   $\\sigma_{gas}$ is the collision cross-section for two gas molecules. For simple hard spheres of diameter $d$, this is $\\sigma_{gas} = \\pi d^2$.\n    *   The factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ accounts for the fact that both colliding particles are moving (averaging over the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities).\n\n2.  **Mean Free Path of Electrons ($\\lambda_2$)**:\n    This is the average distance an electron from the high-energy beam travels before colliding (scattering) with a gas molecule. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they have very high velocities, much greater than the thermal velocities of the gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets.\n    The formula for the mean free path of a fast particle in a gas of stationary targets is:\n    $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma_{e-gas}}$\n    where:\n    *   $n$ is the same number density of gas molecules.\n    *   $\\sigma_{e-gas}$ is the collision cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule.\n    *   Note the absence of the $\\sqrt{2}$ factor because the targets are effectively stationary.\n\n3.  **Comparing $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$**:\n    Let's find the ratio of $\\lambda_2$ to $\\lambda_1$:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\frac{1/(n \\sigma_{e-gas})}{1/(\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_{gas})} = \\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\sigma_{gas}}{\\sigma_{e-gas}}$\n\n    Now we need to compare the cross-sections:\n    *   **$\\sigma_{gas}$**: The collision cross-section for two identical molecules of diameter $d$ is the area of a circle with radius $d$ (the distance between centers at collision), so $\\sigma_{gas} = \\pi d^2$.\n    *   **$\\sigma_{e-gas}$**: The collision cross-section for a point-like particle (the electron, whose size is negligible) and a molecule of diameter $d$ is the area of a circle with radius $d/2$, so $\\sigma_{e-gas} = \\pi (d/2)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\sigma_{gas} = 4 \\cdot \\sigma_{e-gas}$.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio**:\n    Substituting the relationship between the cross-sections into our ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\sigma_{gas}}{\\sigma_{e-gas}} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 4 = 4\\sqrt{2}$\n    Since $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$, the ratio is approximately $4 \\times 1.414 = 5.656$.\n    So, $\\lambda_2 \\approx 5.66 \\lambda_1$.\n\n    *Even if we made the simplifying (and physically less accurate) assumption that the cross-sections are equal ($\\sigma_{gas} = \\sigma_{e-gas}$), the ratio would be:*\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$\n    So, $\\lambda_2 \\approx 1.414 \\lambda_1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    In either case, $\\lambda_2$ is significantly larger than $\\lambda_1$. We need to check which option is consistent with our findings.\n    *   A) $\\lambda_2 < \\lambda_1$: False.\n    *   B) $\\lambda_2 >= 1.22 \\lambda_1$: True. Both our detailed calculation ($\\lambda_2 \\approx 5.66 \\lambda_1$) and the simplified one ($\\lambda_2 \\approx 1.414 \\lambda_1$) satisfy this inequality, as $5.66 > 1.22$ and $1.414 > 1.22$.\n    *   C) $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_1$: False.\n    *   D) $\\lambda_1 < \\lambda_2 < 1.22 \\lambda_1$: False.\n\nThe mean free path of the electrons ($\\lambda_2$) is longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules ($\\lambda_1$) for two main reasons: the absence of the $\\sqrt{2}$ factor related to relative molecular motion, and the smaller collision cross-section for a point-like electron compared to a molecule-molecule collision. Both effects increase the mean free path, leading to $\\lambda_2 > \\lambda_1$. The most conservative estimate gives $\\lambda_2 \\approx 1.414 \\lambda_1$, which is greater than $1.22 \\lambda_1$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
