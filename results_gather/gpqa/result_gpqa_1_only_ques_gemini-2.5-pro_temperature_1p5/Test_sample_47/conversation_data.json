    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of its hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine.**\n*   **Substrate:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂)\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the α-hydrogens on a carbon next to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide.**\n*   **Substrate:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with a proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position) rearranges to form a carboxylic acid with a ring contraction. The base (OH⁻) removes an α'-proton from C6, which leads to the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This strained intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide at the carbonyl carbon, followed by ring-opening to yield the most stable carbanion, which after protonation gives the final product.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. (Note: Other reactions like SN2 or E2 are less likely. E2 would lead to a dead end in the next step, and the sequence of reagents strongly suggests the formation of a carboxylic acid).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine.**\n*   **Substrate:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. SOCl₂ is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.**\n*   **Substrate:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ or LTBA).\n*   **Reaction:** LTBA is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for selectively reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to alcohols.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Now, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogens have different chemical environments and will produce separate signals in an ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a five-membered ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached. Let's label the carbons of the ring C1 to C5, with C1 being the carbon attached to the -CHO group.\n\n      H(a) (aldehyde proton)\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\n   C1-H(b) ------ C2H₂(c,d)\n  /           \\\nC5H₂(i,j)          C3H₂(e,f)\n  \\           /\n   ----C4H₂(g,h)----\n\nWe analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Assuming rapid ring flipping (pseudorotation) at room temperature, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the H-C=O group, the C1-H(b) bond, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   C2 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n*   C3 is chemically equivalent to C4.\n*   Protons on C2 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C5.\n*   Protons on C3 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C4.\n\nNow, let's count the sets of distinct protons:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H(a))**: This proton is unique. This is our **first** set.\n2.  **The proton on C1 (H(b))**: This methine proton is on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is our **second** set.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5**: Let's consider the two protons on C2. Since C1 is a substituted carbon, the two protons on the adjacent C2 are **diastereotopic**. This means they are chemically non-equivalent and will give two different signals. The plane of symmetry makes the \"upper\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to two distinct sets. These are our **third** and **fourth** sets.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4**: Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two geminal protons on C3 are also diastereotopic due to the influence of the substituent at C1. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to their counterparts on C4. So, the four protons on C3 and C4 also give rise to two distinct sets. These are our **fifth** and **sixth** sets.\n\nIn total, we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe correct answer is 6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
