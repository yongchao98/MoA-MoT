    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Product\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's deconstruct this name:\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**: This is a six-membered saturated ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring) and a ketone/carbonyl group at position 2. This structure is a cyclic ester, also known as a lactone. Specifically, it's a δ-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon-4 of the ring.\n*   **(R)- or (S)-**: This refers to the stereochemistry at the chiral center. In this molecule, the only chiral center is carbon-4, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n\nA lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. A six-membered δ-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor for our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\n\nUpon acid-catalyzed cyclization (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1, forming the six-membered lactone. The carbon atoms of the acid map to the lactone ring as follows:\n*   C1 (acid) → C2 (lactone carbonyl)\n*   C3 (acid, with ethyl group) → C4 (lactone, with ethyl group)\n\nThe key point is that the stereocenter at C3 of the acid becomes the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone, and this cyclization reaction **does not change the R/S configuration**.\n*   An (R)-hydroxy acid will produce an (R)-lactone.\n*   An (S)-hydroxy acid will produce an (S)-lactone.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Starting Materials\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This name describes a molecule with a five-carbon chain that has:\n*   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1).\n*   An isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) at the other end (C5).\n*   An ethyl group at C3, which is the chiral center.\n\nThe structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOiBu(5)`\n\nThis molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one acid group is free and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions\n\nWe need to convert the starting material, which has a carboxylic acid and an ester, into the product, a lactone. This involves selectively reducing one of the two carbonyl functional groups to an alcohol, which can then cyclize.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It does not reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n### Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction**: LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group (-COOiBu at C5) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH at C1) remains unchanged.\n    `A [HOOC-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-COOiBu] --(LiBH₄)--> HOOC-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n2.  **Intermediate**: The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n3.  **Lactonization**: The H⁺ workup protonates the intermediate and catalyzes the cyclization to form the lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry**: This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C3. To obtain the **(R)-lactone** product, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n5.  **Conclusion for A**: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction**: BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH at C1) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group (-COOiBu at C5) remains largely unchanged.\n    `B [HOOC-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-COOiBu] --(BH₃)--> HOCH₂-CH₂(Et)CH-CH₂-COOiBu`\n2.  **Intermediate**: The intermediate formed is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Lactonization**: The H⁺ workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the six-membered lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry**: This reaction sequence also does not affect the stereocenter. To obtain the **(S)-lactone** product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n5.  **Conclusion for B**: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
