    "Let's break down Maxwell's equations and see how they would change. The key is to think about symmetry. In our universe, we have electric charges but no magnetic charges (monopoles).\n\nThe standard Maxwell's equations are:\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** ∇ ⋅ **E** = ρ / ε₀\n    *   This relates the *divergence* of the electric field (**E**) to electric charge density (ρ). It essentially says electric field lines start and end on electric charges.\n2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0\n    *   This relates the *divergence* of the magnetic field (**B**). It says the divergence is always zero, which means there are no magnetic monopoles. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.\n3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t\n    *   This relates the *curl* (or circulation) of the electric field (**E**) to a changing magnetic field.\n4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** ∇ × **B** = μ₀(**J** + ε₀∂**E**/∂t)\n    *   This relates the *curl* (or circulation) of the magnetic field (**B**) to electric currents (**J**) and a changing electric field.\n\nNow, let's introduce magnetic monopoles (magnetic charge, let's call its density ρₘ) and see what changes:\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** This is the most obvious change. If magnetic monopoles exist, they are sources and sinks for the magnetic field, just like electric charges are for the electric field. The divergence of **B** would no longer be zero.\n    *   **The equation for the divergence of the magnetic field would change.**\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** To make the equations symmetric, if a moving electric charge (**J**) creates a magnetic field, then a moving magnetic charge (a magnetic current, **J**ₘ) should create an electric field. This magnetic current term would be added to Faraday's Law.\n    *   **The equation for the circulation of the electric field would change.**\n\nThe other two equations, which deal with the sources of the electric field (electric charges) and the effects of electric currents, would remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are:\n1.  The one related to the **divergence of the magnetic field** (Gauss's Law for Magnetism).\n2.  The one related to the **circulation of the electric field** (Faraday's Law).\n\nThis corresponds directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
