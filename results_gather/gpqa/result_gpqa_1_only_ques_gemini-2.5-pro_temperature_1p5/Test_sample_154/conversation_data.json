    "To calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$, we use the formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\nFirst, we need to find the expectation values $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ for the given state of the system.\n\nThe state of the system is given by the column vector:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is given in matrix form as:\n$P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. This means $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis, and the diagonal elements are its eigenvalues: $\\lambda_1 = \\hbar$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\\lambda_3 = -\\hbar$. The state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ is expressed in this basis.\nThe components of $|\\psi\\rangle$ are the amplitudes for finding the system in the corresponding eigenstates.\n*   The amplitude for the eigenvalue $\\hbar$ is $c_1 = -1/2$.\n*   The amplitude for the eigenvalue $0$ is $c_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   The amplitude for the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ is $c_3 = -1/2$.\n\nThe probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue are given by the square of the magnitude of these amplitudes:\n*   $P(\\hbar) = |c_1|^2 = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n*   $P(0) = |c_2|^2 = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$\n*   $P(-\\hbar) = |c_3|^2 = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n(Note: The probabilities sum to $1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$, so the state is normalized.)\n\nNow, we can calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum_i \\lambda_i P(\\lambda_i) = (\\hbar) \\cdot P(\\hbar) + (0) \\cdot P(0) + (-\\hbar) \\cdot P(-\\hbar)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (\\hbar)(1/4) + (0)(1/2) + (-\\hbar)(1/4) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, which is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_i \\lambda_i^2 P(\\lambda_i) = (\\hbar)^2 \\cdot P(\\hbar) + (0)^2 \\cdot P(0) + (-\\hbar)^2 \\cdot P(-\\hbar)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (\\hbar^2)(1/4) + (0)(1/2) + (\\hbar^2)(1/4) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $\\hbar/2$\nB) $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$\nC) $\\hbar$\nD) $\\sqrt{2}\\hbar$\n\nThe calculated uncertainty matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
