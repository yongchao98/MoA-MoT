    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Finding Product (A)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The strong base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) deprotonates the highly acidic α-carbon between the two ester groups to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group) is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. This is followed by protonation of the resulting enolate intermediate by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent.\n    1.  **Attack:** The [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻ anion adds to the β-carbon.\n    2.  **Protonation:** The intermediate is protonated at the α-carbon.\n*   **Product Structure (A):** The new C-C bond forms between the β-carbon of the acrylate and the α-carbon of the malonate.\n    The resulting structure is:\n    p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃\n*   **Naming Product (A):** This structure corresponds to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. The main chain can be seen as a propane backbone where C1 has two methoxycarbonyl groups, C2 has a p-tolyl group, and C3 is part of a CH₂-COOCH₃ group.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Finding Product (B)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which proceeds via a Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon of the original enone system, which is the α-carbon to the nitrogen atom (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. The β-carbon (the one bonded to the methyl group) is the electrophilic site.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile, forming an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    2.  **Protonation:** An internal proton transfer or protonation from the solvent (MeOH) neutralizes the carbanion.\n    3.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the resulting iminium salt back into a ketone. The piperidine is removed, and a carbonyl group (C=O) is restored at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Product Structure (B):** The final product is cyclohexanone substituted at the C2 position with the group derived from but-2-enenitrile. The added group is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN.\n    So, the product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n*   **Naming Product (B):** The IUPAC name for this structure is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The butanenitrile is the parent chain, and the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group is a substituent at position 3. The keto form is the major product after acidic hydrolysis, not the enol form.\n\n### **Reaction 3: Finding Reactant (C)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. We need to identify the Michael donor, C, by analyzing the product and the given Michael acceptor.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring substituted at C2 (the acidic carbon between the two carbonyls) with a `3-oxobutyl` group (-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃).\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** The Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor. In the product, the bond is between C2 of the ring and the first CH₂ of the `3-oxobutyl` group. This CH₂ corresponds to the β-carbon (CH₂) of MVK. Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n*   **Reactant (C):** The nucleophile is generated by the base (KOH) deprotonating the Michael donor. For the product to be formed, the starting Michael donor must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
