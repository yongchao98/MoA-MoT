    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Redshift Calculation:** The observation is of a structure at a cosmological distance of 2.1 Gpc. Light traveling over such vast distances is stretched by the expansion of the universe, an effect known as redshift. This means the observed energy of the light is lower than the energy it had when it was emitted (its rest-frame energy). We first need to calculate the redshift (z).\n\n    Using the Hubble-Lemaître law, v = H₀ * D, and for cosmological redshifts, we can approximate z ≈ (H₀ * D) / c.\n    *   Hubble Constant (H₀) ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc\n    *   Distance (D) = 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc\n    *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\n    z ≈ (70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc) / 300,000 km/s\n    z ≈ 147,000 / 300,000\n    z ≈ 0.49\n\n2.  **Rest-Frame Energy Calculation:** Now, we can calculate the original, un-redshifted energy of the absorption line (E_rest).\n    *   E_rest = E_observed * (1 + z)\n    *   E_rest = (3.9 * 10^-6 eV) * (1 + 0.49)\n    *   E_rest = (3.9 * 10^-6 eV) * 1.49\n    *   E_rest ≈ 5.81 * 10^-6 eV\n\n3.  **Identifying the Transition:** We need to identify what atomic or molecular transition corresponds to an energy of approximately 5.81 micro-electron volts (µeV). This energy corresponds to the famous **21-cm line** (or 1420 MHz line) of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I). This line is caused by the hyperfine transition, where the spin of the electron flips relative to the spin of the proton in a hydrogen atom. The precise energy of this transition is ~5.87 µeV, which is in excellent agreement with our calculated value.\n\n4.  **Connecting to the Interstellar Medium (ISM):** The 21-cm line is a fundamental tool for studying the interstellar medium. The question asks what would be observed with this *absorption line*.\n    *   Neutral atomic hydrogen exists in two main phases: the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM).\n    *   The CNM is dense and cold (around 50-100 K).\n    *   The WNM is diffuse and warm (around 6000-10000 K).\n    *   While both phases emit 21-cm radiation, strong *absorption* lines are almost exclusively produced by the **Cold Neutral Medium**. In the cold, dense gas, there are more atoms in the lower energy state available to absorb photons from a background source. In the warm gas, the energy levels are populated almost equally, making it a very poor absorber.\n\nTherefore, this specific absorption line is a tracer for the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<B>>>"
