    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charges and Conductor:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. Its net charge is zero.\n    *   A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:**\n    *   The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. An amount of charge equal to $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This is a consequence of Gauss's Law: if you imagine a Gaussian surface within the material of the conductor that encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero. For the field to be zero, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the induced charge on the inner surface must be $-q$ to cancel out the $+q$ charge inside.\n    *   Since the conductor was initially neutral, and a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n    *   A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it.\n    *   The electric field at any point outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all charges present:\n        i. The original charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n        ii. The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n        iii. The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   The principle of electrostatic shielding tells us that the net electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the induced charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *only* by the charge present on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:**\n    *   We have a charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Since the conductor is a sphere and there are no other external charges, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer spherical surface. This is because the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves to make the potential on the surface constant, which for a sphere happens when the charge distribution is uniform. The configuration inside the cavity is completely shielded and does not influence this distribution.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (which can be derived from Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   This charge acts as if it were a point charge located at the center of the large spherical conductor.\n    *   The point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of this conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position relative to the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to point P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractors to test the understanding of the fundamental principles of electrostatics, specifically charge induction and shielding in conductors. The correct answer depends only on the total charge enclosed ($q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor to the observation point ($L$).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, ignores the conductor's effect)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, uses a non-physical distance)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, uses a non-physical distance)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, based on electrostatic shielding and the shell theorem)\n\n<<<D>>>"
