    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance and the distance itself.\n\n1.  **Define the given information:**\n    The number of stars per unit of parallax, let's call it $N_{plx}$, is given to vary as $1/plx^5$. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n    $N_{plx} = \\frac{dN}{d(plx)} \\propto \\frac{1}{plx^5}$\n    where $N$ is the number of stars and $plx$ is the parallax.\n\n2.  **Define the quantity to be found:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance, let's call it $N_r$, varies with distance $r$. Mathematically, this is:\n    $N_r = \\frac{dN}{dr}$\n\n3.  **Relate parallax and distance:**\n    Parallax ($plx$) is defined as the inverse of the distance ($r$). We can write this relationship as:\n    $plx = \\frac{1}{r}$\n    (assuming appropriate units, e.g., parallax in arcseconds and distance in parsecs).\n\n4.  **Relate the differential quantities:**\n    We can relate the number of stars per unit distance ($N_r$) to the number of stars per unit parallax ($N_{plx}$) using the chain rule of differentiation:\n    $\\frac{dN}{dr} = \\frac{dN}{d(plx)} \\cdot \\frac{d(plx)}{dr}$\n    Since the number of stars must be a positive quantity, we consider the magnitude of the change:\n    $\\frac{dN}{dr} = \\left| \\frac{dN}{d(plx)} \\cdot \\frac{d(plx)}{dr} \\right| = \\frac{dN}{d(plx)} \\left| \\frac{d(plx)}{dr} \\right|$\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative term |d(plx)/dr|:**\n    Using the relationship $plx = 1/r = r^{-1}$, we can differentiate parallax with respect to distance:\n    $\\frac{d(plx)}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}(r^{-1}) = -r^{-2} = -\\frac{1}{r^2}$\n    The absolute value is:\n    $\\left| \\frac{d(plx)}{dr} \\right| = \\frac{1}{r^2}$\n\n6.  **Substitute and solve for N_r:**\n    Now we substitute the known proportionalities into our chain rule equation:\n    $N_r = \\frac{dN}{dr} \\propto N_{plx} \\cdot \\left| \\frac{d(plx)}{dr} \\right|$\n    $N_r \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{plx^5} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{r^2} \\right)$\n    To get the final relationship in terms of $r$, we replace $plx$ with $1/r$:\n    $N_r \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{(1/r)^5} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{r^2} \\right)$\n    $N_r \\propto (r^5) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{r^2} \\right)$\n    $N_r \\propto \\frac{r^5}{r^2} = r^3$\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance ($r^3$).\n\n<<<B>>>"
