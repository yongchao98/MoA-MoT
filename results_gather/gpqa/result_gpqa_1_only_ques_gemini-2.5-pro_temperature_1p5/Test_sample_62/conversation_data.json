    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the momentum of the absorbed photon.\n\n**1. Understand the Energy Levels of the System**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model (also known as the non-rigid rotor). The total energy of the molecule in a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2)ħω + B·J(J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` = 0, 1, 2, ... (vibrational quantum number)\n*   `J` = 0, 1, 2, ... (rotational quantum number)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I)\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia, defined as I = μR²\n*   `μ` is the reduced mass of the molecule\n\n**2. Identify the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State (Ground State):** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when both `v` and `J` are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and switches to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". In quantum mechanics, a transition via photon absorption must obey selection rules. For a diatomic molecule with a permanent dipole moment (like XY, where X ≠ Y), the selection rules for rotation-vibration transitions are:\n    *   Δv = +1 (for absorption)\n    *   ΔJ = ±1\n\n    Starting from the initial state (v=0, J=0), we apply these rules:\n    *   The new vibrational state must be `v = 1`.\n    *   The new rotational state must change by `ΔJ = ±1`. Since `J` cannot be negative, only `ΔJ = +1` is allowed. The new rotational state must be `J = 1`.\n\n    Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)\n\nΔE = [(1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1)] - [(0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0)(0+1)]\nΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n**4. Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities**\n\nWe need to calculate the values of `ħω` and `2B`.\n\n*   **Constants and Given Values:**\n    *   Mx = 20 amu\n    *   My = 2 amu\n    *   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   1 amu ≈ 1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Calculate Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Calculate Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    I ≈ (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Calculate Rotational Constant (B):**\n    B = ħ² / (2I)\n    B ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    B ≈ 4.60 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Calculate ΔE:**\n    Term 1: ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    Term 2: 2B ≈ 2 * (4.60 x 10⁻²³ J) = 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\n    ΔE = ħω + 2B ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\n    ΔE ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    (Note that the rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy.)\n\n**5. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation E = pc, where `c` is the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\np = E / c = ΔE / c\np ≈ (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is very close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
