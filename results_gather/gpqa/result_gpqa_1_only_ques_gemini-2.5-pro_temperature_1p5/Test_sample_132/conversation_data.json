    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation involving buffer solutions and polyprotic acid equilibria. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of the buffer components**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of the conjugate acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and the conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) added to the solution.\n\n*   The source of the conjugate acid is potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄).\n    *   Mass of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Since KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻, the moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007348 mol.\n\n*   The source of the conjugate base is disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n    *   Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Since Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates completely into 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻, and 2H₂O, the moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005618 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components**\n\nNext, we calculate the molar concentrations of the acid and base in the solution.\n\n*   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n*   Initial concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻:\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]**\n\nThe solution is a buffer formed by the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ conjugate pair. This corresponds to the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄).\n\n*   The equilibrium reaction is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n\nWe can use the equilibrium expression for Ka₂ to find the [H⁺]:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.308)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced in the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid.\n\n*   The equilibrium reaction is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n\nWe use the equilibrium expression for Ka₃ to find [PO₄³⁻]:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nNow we substitute the values we have calculated. We can assume that the equilibrium concentrations of [HPO₄²⁻] and [H⁺] are approximately equal to the values determined from the buffer system because Ka₃ is very small, meaning very little HPO₄²⁻ will dissociate further.\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.34636)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.23 x 10⁻¹³ M / (10⁻¹) * 10\nWait, calculation error here. Let's re-do the final calculation:\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n[PO₄³⁻] = (5.0562 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.2345 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**Step 5: Compare with options**\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.2345 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
