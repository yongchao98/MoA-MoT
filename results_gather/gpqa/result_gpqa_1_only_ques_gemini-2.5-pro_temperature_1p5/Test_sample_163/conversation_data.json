    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 ($M_1$) to the total mass of system_2 ($M_2$).\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can measure the radial velocities of both stars), the total mass of the system ($M = m_a + m_b$) can be determined using the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definition of radial velocity:\n\n$M = \\frac{P (K_a + K_b)^3}{2 \\pi G \\sin^3 i}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $M$ is the total mass of the system.\n*   $P$ is the orbital period.\n*   $K_a$ and $K_b$ are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $i$ is the inclination angle of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n**2. Use the Eclipsing Information**\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information. For eclipses to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the binary system. This means the inclination angle, $i$, must be very close to 90 degrees.\nWhen $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, and therefore $\\sin^3(i) \\approx 1$.\nSo, for both eclipsing systems, we can approximate the mass formula as:\n\n$M \\approx \\frac{P (K_a + K_b)^3}{2 \\pi G}$\n\n**3. Set Up the Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which means we need to calculate the ratio $M_1 / M_2$.\n\n$\\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{\\frac{P_1 (K_{1a} + K_{1b})^3}{2 \\pi G}}{\\frac{P_2 (K_{2a} + K_{2b})^3}{2 \\pi G}}$\n\nThe constant term $2 \\pi G$ cancels out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\n$\\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{P_1 (K_{1a} + K_{1b})^3}{P_2 (K_{2a} + K_{2b})^3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_{1a} + K_{1b}}{K_{2a} + K_{2b}}\\right)^3$\n\n**4. Plug in the Given Values**\n\nLet's list the values for each system:\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period, $P_1 = 2$ years\n    *   Velocity amplitudes, $K_{1a} = 10$ km/s and $K_{1b} = 5$ km/s\n    *   Sum of velocities, $K_{1a} + K_{1b} = 10 + 5 = 15$ km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period, $P_2 = 1$ year\n    *   Velocity amplitudes, $K_{2a} = 15$ km/s and $K_{2b} = 10$ km/s\n    *   Sum of velocities, $K_{2a} + K_{2b} = 15 + 10 = 25$ km/s\n\nNow substitute these values into the ratio formula. We can use the periods in years and velocities in km/s directly since we are taking ratios, and the units will cancel out.\n\n$\\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\left(\\frac{2 \\text{ yr}}{1 \\text{ yr}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{15 \\text{ km/s}}{25 \\text{ km/s}}\\right)^3$\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nFirst, simplify the fractions:\n*   $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = 2$\n*   $\\frac{15}{25} = \\frac{3}{5}$\n\nNow, substitute these back into the equation:\n\n$\\frac{M_1}{M_2} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^3$\n$\\frac{M_1}{M_2} = 2 \\times \\frac{3^3}{5^3}$\n$\\frac{M_1}{M_2} = 2 \\times \\frac{27}{125}$\n$\\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{54}{125}$\n$\\frac{M_1}{M_2} = 0.432$\n\nThe calculated factor is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 0.7\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
