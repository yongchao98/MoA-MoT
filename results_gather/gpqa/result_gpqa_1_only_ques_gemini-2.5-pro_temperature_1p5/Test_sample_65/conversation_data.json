    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model that includes higher-dimensional operators suppressed by a high energy scale Î›. It is constructed to be a consistent quantum field theory that respects certain fundamental symmetries. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a foundational principle of the Standard Model and relativistic quantum field theory in general. The SMEFT is constructed as a local, relativistic field theory, meaning all terms in the Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators, must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry:** Poincare symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry (boosts and rotations) with spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, this is a fundamental assumption in the construction of SMEFT. Invariance under spacetime translations ensures the conservation of energy and momentum. All SMEFT operators are constructed to respect Poincare symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model by the weak interaction (specifically, the complex phase in the CKM matrix). Since the Standard Model itself does not respect CP symmetry, there is no reason to impose it on the new physics operators in SMEFT. In fact, many SMEFT operators are constructed to introduce new sources of CP violation, which are actively searched for in experiments. Therefore, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Lagrangian is automatically invariant under the combined transformation of CPT (Charge-Parity-Time Reversal). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).\n\n<<<B>>>"
