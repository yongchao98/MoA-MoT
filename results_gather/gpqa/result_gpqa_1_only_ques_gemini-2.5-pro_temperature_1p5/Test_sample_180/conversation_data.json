    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate flux ratio.\n\n### 1. Understand the Hypothetical Scenario\n*   **What stopped?** The proton-proton III (pp-III) branch. The key reaction in this branch for producing neutrinos is the decay of Boron-8 (⁸B). So, the production of ⁸B neutrinos has ceased.\n*   **What is still active?** All other reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle branches. The crucial point is that the **pp-II branch is still active**.\n*   **What is the pp-II branch's key neutrino output?** The pp-II branch produces a nearly mono-energetic line of neutrinos from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be). These neutrinos have an energy of **861 keV** (this happens 90% of the time for ⁷Be electron capture).\n*   **What are we measuring?** The ratio of the total neutrino flux in two adjacent energy bands:\n    *   Band 1: 700-800 keV\n    *   Band 2: 800-900 keV\n\n### 2. Analyze the Neutrino Sources in Each Band (After the Change)\n\nLet's identify which neutrino sources contribute to each energy band *under the hypothetical scenario* (i.e., with no ⁸B neutrinos).\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The dominant source in this band is the **⁷Be neutrino line at 861 keV**. Since 861 keV falls squarely within this band, the entire flux from this source is counted here.\n    *   There is also a small background contribution from the continuous spectrum of CNO cycle neutrinos.\n    *   The flux from the ⁷Be line is enormous, on the order of 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s. The CNO contribution in this small band is negligible in comparison.\n    *   Therefore, **Flux(Band 2) ≈ Total Flux(⁷Be neutrinos)**.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The ⁸B neutrinos, which would have contributed a continuous spectrum here, are gone.\n    *   The ⁷Be line is at 861 keV, so it does not contribute to this band.\n    *   The main `pp` neutrinos have energies below 420 keV, so they don't contribute.\n    *   The only remaining significant source of neutrinos in this energy range is the continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle** (specifically from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays).\n    *   Therefore, **Flux(Band 1) = Flux(CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range)**.\n\n### 3. Estimate the Ratio\n\nNow we need to compare the magnitudes of these two fluxes.\n\n*   **Flux(Band 2):** Dominated by the total flux of ⁷Be neutrinos, which is approximately **5 × 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s**.\n*   **Flux(Band 1):** This is the portion of the CNO neutrino flux that falls into a 100 keV wide band. The total flux from the main CNO sources is about 5 × 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s, but this is spread out over a wide energy range (roughly 1.5 MeV or 1500 keV). A rough estimate for the flux in our 100 keV band would be:\n    Flux(Band 1) ≈ (Total CNO Flux) × (Bandwidth / Total CNO Energy Range)\n    Flux(Band 1) ≈ (5 × 10⁸) × (100 keV / 1500 keV) ≈ **3.3 × 10⁷ neutrinos/cm²/s**.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Final Ratio\n\nRatio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)\nRatio ≈ (3.3 × 10⁷) / (5 × 10⁹)\nRatio ≈ 0.66 × 10⁻²\nRatio ≈ **0.0066**\n\nThis value is very close to 0.01. The key takeaway is that the flux in Band 2, containing the intense ⁷Be line, is about two orders of magnitude (a factor of 10²) larger than the flux in Band 1, which only contains a small slice of the much weaker CNO continuum.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
