    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the shape of the aperture for N -> infinity.**\nThe aperture is an N-sided regular polygon. A key property given is that all apothems have the same length, 'a'. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. This distance 'a' is the radius of the circle inscribed within the polygon.\n\nLet R be the circumradius, which is the distance from the center to a vertex. The relationship between the apothem 'a' and the circumradius 'R' for an N-sided regular polygon is given by:\n$a = R \\cos(\\pi/N)$\n\nAs the number of sides N approaches infinity ($N \\to \\infty$), the angle $\\pi/N$ approaches 0.\n$\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\cos(\\pi/N) = \\cos(0) = 1$\nTherefore, in the limit, $a = R \\times 1$, which means $R = a$.\n\nSince both the inscribed radius and the circumscribed radius approach 'a', the polygon itself converges to a perfect circle of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Use the formula for Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture.**\nThe problem now simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'. The far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity $I$ at an angle $\\theta$ from the central axis is given by:\n\n$I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left[ \\frac{2 J_1(k a \\sin \\theta)}{k a \\sin \\theta} \\right]^2$\n\nwhere:\n*   $I_0$ is the intensity at the center.\n*   $J_1$ is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n*   $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$ is the wave number.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light.\n\n**Step 3: Find the angular positions of the minima.**\nThe intensity minima occur when the numerator is zero, which means $J_1(k a \\sin \\theta) = 0$ (for $\\theta \\neq 0$). The minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$. Let's denote the zeros as $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots$. The first few values are:\n*   $x_1 \\approx 3.8317$ (This gives the first minimum)\n*   $x_2 \\approx 7.0156$ (This gives the second minimum)\n*   $x_3 \\approx 10.1735$ (This gives the third minimum)\n\nFor the m-th minimum, the condition is:\n$k a \\sin(\\theta_m) = x_m$\n$\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} a \\sin(\\theta_m) = x_m$\n\nThe problem states we can use the small angle approximation, so $\\sin(\\theta_m) \\approx \\theta_m$.\n$\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} a \\theta_m = x_m$\nSolving for the angular position $\\theta_m$:\n$\\theta_m = \\frac{x_m \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima.**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. This corresponds to the difference between the angular position of the second minimum ($\\theta_2$) and the first minimum ($\\theta_1$).\n\nAngular position of the first minimum ($\\theta_1$):\n$\\theta_1 = \\frac{x_1 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{3.8317 \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nAngular position of the second minimum ($\\theta_2$):\n$\\theta_2 = \\frac{x_2 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{7.0156 \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nThe angular distance between them is $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1$:\n$\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{x_2 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} - \\frac{x_1 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{(x_2 - x_1)\\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nNow, substitute the values of the zeros:\n$\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317)\\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{3.1839 \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nFinally, calculate the numerical coefficient:\n$\\frac{3.1839}{2\\pi} \\approx \\frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \\approx 0.5067...$\n\nSo, the angular distance is:\n$\\Delta\\theta \\approx 0.507 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\nThe calculated value is approximately $0.507 \\lambda/a$. Let's examine the options:\nA) $0.610 \\lambda / a$ (This corresponds to the position of the first minimum, $\\theta_1$)\nB) $1.220 \\lambda /a$ (This corresponds to the angular width of the central maximum, $2\\theta_1$)\nC) $0.506 \\lambda / a$\nD) $0.500 \\lambda / a$ (This would be the answer for a square aperture)\n\nOur calculated value $0.507 \\lambda/a$ is extremely close to option C, $0.506 \\lambda/a$. The small difference is likely due to the rounding of the coefficient in the option. Thus, C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
