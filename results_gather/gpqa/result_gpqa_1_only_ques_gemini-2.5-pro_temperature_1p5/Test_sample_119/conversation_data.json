    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself.\n\n1.  **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, denoted by `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Number of stars in a volume:** The number of stars `N` in a given volume `V` is `N = ρ * V`.\n\n3.  **Consider a thin spherical shell:** Let's find the number of stars `dN` located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from the observer, with a thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell `dV` is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV ≈ 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`.\n\n4.  **Relate distance to parallax:** The parallax `plx` of a star is inversely proportional to its distance `d`. The standard definition is `plx = 1/d`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds. From this, we have `d = 1/plx`.\n\n5.  **Relate the distance interval `dd` to the parallax interval `d(plx)`:** We need to find how a change in distance `dd` corresponds to a change in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    This means `dd = (-1/plx²) d(plx)`. When considering the number of stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we can write `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n\n6.  **Express the number of stars in the shell in terms of parallax:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` from steps 4 and 5 into the equation for `dN` from step 3.\n    `dN = 4πρ * d² * |dd|`\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) |d(plx)|`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN / |d(plx)|`.\n    Dividing the equation from step 6 by `|d(plx)|`, we get:\n    `dN / |d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Since `4πρ` is a constant, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is `~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
