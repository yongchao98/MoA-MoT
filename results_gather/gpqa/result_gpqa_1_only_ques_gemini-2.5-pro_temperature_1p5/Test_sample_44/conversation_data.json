    "Here is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. This means they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in a 1D well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin projection (`m_s`, which can be spin-up or spin-down). This implies that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   and so on.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we place the four fermions into the lowest possible energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   Place the first two particles in the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the next available level, n=2 (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n$E_{GS} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we take the ground state configuration and promote one particle to the lowest possible unoccupied energy level. The highest energy particle in the ground state is in the n=2 level. We promote it to the next available level, which is n=3.\n\n*   The configuration becomes: Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible one-particle promotions that result in an energy higher than the first excited state.\n\n*   **Option A:** Promote the other particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 2(9E) = 20E$.\n*   **Option B:** Promote a particle from the n=1 level of the ground state to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 2(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Option C:** Promote a particle from the n=2 level of the ground state to the n=4 level.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
