    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates (HCl → H+ + Cl-).\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it completely dissociates, yielding two moles of OH- per mole of Ba(OH)2 (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n    *   Moles of OH- = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform neutralization reactions.**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (HCl) will react with the strong base (Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n*   The H+ from HCl is the limiting reactant. All of it will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n*   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant in this step. All of it will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining after reacting with CH3COOH = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Determine the composition of the final solution and calculate the pH.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of strong base (OH-). The presence of this excess strong base will dictate the pH of the solution.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is: pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
