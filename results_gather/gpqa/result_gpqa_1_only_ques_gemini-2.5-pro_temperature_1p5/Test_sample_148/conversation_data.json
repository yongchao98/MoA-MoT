    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the NMR Data:** The key observation is that a single proton (the alpha-proton) gives rise to two distinct peaks of roughly equal intensity. Since spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, this indicates that the proton exists in two different chemical environments. These two molecular species must be present in a nearly 1:1 ratio. This points towards the presence of two isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different compounds in a 1:1 ratio. The mass spectrometry (MS) data is crucial: both peaks have the *exact same mass*, and this mass matches the expected product. This tells us two critical things:\n    *   The two species are **isomers** (same chemical formula, same mass). This rules out impurities like precursors or side-products with different molecular weights.\n    *   The two species are separable by standard chromatography, which means they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same molecular formula and mass but different 3D arrangements. Because they are not mirror images, they have different physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they will have different NMR spectra (giving two sets of peaks) and can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography (giving two LC peaks). This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the observations. A common source of diastereomerism in peptides is the presence of a proline residue, which can exist as both *cis* and *trans* isomers around the peptide bond, or epimerization at a single chiral center during synthesis.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is not a standard term. If it means a single amino acid was acylated twice, this would create a product with a different (higher) mass. The MS data shows the expected mass for both peaks, ruling this out.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis (e.g., a starting material or a shorter peptide fragment) would almost certainly have a different molecular weight than the final product. The MS data contradicts this.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished by standard ¹H NMR (they would give a single set of peaks) and cannot be separated by standard LC (they would co-elute as a single peak). This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the evidence—two distinct species with the same mass but different chromatographic and spectroscopic properties—is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
