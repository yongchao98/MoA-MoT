    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to assess two main criteria for each star:\n1.  **Observability:** Can the star be seen from the Paranal Observatory in Chile (Latitude ≈ -24.6°)?\n2.  **Brightness:** Is the star bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure?\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Limiting Magnitude\n\nFirst, we establish the brightness limit for detection. According to the official ESO overview page for ESPRESSO, under the \"Performance and Science\" section, it states: \"With one Unit Telescope (UT), ESPRESSO is expected to obtain S/N~10 in 1 hour for a G2V star with V=16.5 mag.\"\n\nThis gives us our detection threshold: a star is detectable if its **apparent visual magnitude (V) is less than or equal to 16.5**, and it is observable from Paranal.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** Canopus is one of the brightest stars in the sky, with an apparent V magnitude of approximately **-0.74**.\n*   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of about -52° 41'. Since the Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of -24.6°, Canopus is high in the sky and easily observable.\n*   **Conclusion:** V = -0.74 is much brighter than the limit of 16.5. Therefore, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** Polaris has an apparent V magnitude of approximately **+1.98**.\n*   **Observability:** Polaris is the North Star, with a declination close to +90°. From a latitude of -24.6° in the Southern Hemisphere, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and is therefore **not observable**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since it cannot be observed from Paranal, **Polaris is not detectable.**\n\nFor stars (c) through (f), we first need to calculate their apparent V magnitude (m) using their absolute V magnitude (M) and distance (d) with the distance modulus formula:\n`m - M = 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n\n**c) Star with Mv = 15 mag, d = 10 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** `V - 15 = 5 * log10(10) - 5` -> `V - 15 = 5 * 1 - 5` -> `V = 15 mag`.\n*   **Observability:** The star is on the celestial equator (DEC = 0°), which is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** V = 15 is brighter than the 16.5 magnitude limit. Therefore, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with Mv = 15 mag, d = 200 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** `V - 15 = 5 * log10(200) - 5` -> `V - 15 ≈ 5 * 2.30 - 5` -> `V - 15 ≈ 11.5 - 5` -> `V ≈ 21.5 mag`.\n*   **Observability:** The star is on the celestial equator (DEC = 0°) and is observable.\n*   **Conclusion:** V ≈ 21.5 is fainter than the 16.5 magnitude limit. Therefore, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with Mv = 15 mag, d = 5 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** `V - 15 = 5 * log10(5) - 5` -> `V - 15 ≈ 5 * 0.70 - 5` -> `V - 15 ≈ 3.5 - 5` -> `V ≈ 13.5 mag`.\n*   **Observability:** The star is on the celestial equator (DEC = 0°) and is observable.\n*   **Conclusion:** V ≈ 13.5 is brighter than the 16.5 magnitude limit. Therefore, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with Mv = 15 mag, d = 50 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** `V - 15 = 5 * log10(50) - 5` -> `V - 15 ≈ 5 * 1.70 - 5` -> `V - 15 ≈ 8.5 - 5` -> `V ≈ 18.5 mag`.\n*   **Observability:** The star is on the celestial equator (DEC = 0°) and is observable.\n*   **Conclusion:** V ≈ 18.5 is fainter than the 16.5 magnitude limit. Therefore, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n### Step 3: Count the Detectable Stars\n\nLet's summarize our findings:\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: **Not Detectable**\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Detectable**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **Not Detectable**\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Detectable**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **Not Detectable**\n\nThere are three detectable stars: (a), (c), and (e).\n\n<<<A>>>"
