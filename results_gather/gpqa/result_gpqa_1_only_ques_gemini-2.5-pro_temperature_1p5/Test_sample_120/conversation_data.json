    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Structure:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The bicyclo numbering scheme means the epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6, which are adjacent in the ring. The oxygen is atom 7.\n    *   \"1,3,4-trimethyl\" means there are methyl groups on carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   \"(1R,3R,4R,6S)\" specifies the absolute stereochemistry at these four chiral centers.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, \"Me⁻\".\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The problem provides two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, resulting in inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked.\n\n**3. Apply the Reaction Rules to the Specific Substrate**\n\n*   **Step 3a: Determine the site of attack (Regioselectivity).**\n    *   The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a secondary carbon center.\n    *   C6 is significantly less sterically hindered than C1.\n    *   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Determine the resulting structure.**\n    *   Attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The C-O bond at C1 breaks, and upon workup, the oxygen atom becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The original methyl groups were at C1, C3, and C4. A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n    *   To name the product, we use IUPAC nomenclature. The carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. Following the numbering to give the methyl groups the lowest possible locants, the methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern that would result from attack at C1.\n\n*   **Step 3c: Determine the product's stereochemistry (Stereoselectivity).**\n    *   The reaction causes an **inversion of configuration** at the point of attack (C6).\n    *   The starting material's stereochemistry at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n    *   Inversion of an (S) center produces an **(R)** center.\n    *   The configuration at the other epoxide carbon (C1) is **retained**. The starting material is **(1R)**, so this center remains **(1R)** in the product.\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C3 and C4) which are not part of the reaction are also retained.\n    *   In the IUPAC name of the product, the original C6 is now C2. So, the product must have a **(2R)** configuration. The original C1 is now C1, so it is **(1R)**.\n    *   We are looking for the product: **(1R, 2R, ...)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur analysis shows that the product must have a (2R) configuration due to the inversion at the original (6S) carbon. Option A matches this requirement. Option B would imply retention of configuration, which is incorrect for this reaction. The remote stereocenters (4R, 5R) are also consistent with retention of configuration from the starting material (after renumbering).\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<A>>>"
