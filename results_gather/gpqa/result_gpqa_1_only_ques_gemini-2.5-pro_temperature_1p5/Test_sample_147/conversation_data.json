    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that compound A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the element, M(Y) is its molar mass, n is the number of fluorine atoms, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (19n) / (M(Y) + 19n)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now we test integer values for n to find a corresponding element Y:\n    *   n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ca=40.1)\n    *   n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br=79.9)\n    *   n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb=121.76)\n    *   n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, Dy=162.5)\n    *   n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (in the region of Bi, Pb, Hg)\n    *   n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (very close to Plutonium, Pu=244)\n\n    Let's check the most promising candidate, **Y = Sb (Antimony)**, with **n = 3**.\n    A2 would be **SbF₃**. Let's verify the mass percentage:\n    ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a difference of only 0.25%. This makes Antimony the most likely candidate for element Y.\n\n2.  **Analyze the other compounds and reactions.**\n    *   The problem states that there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Antimony forms SbF₃ and SbF₅ as its main stable binary fluorides, but other less stable or polymeric species are known, making this plausible.\n    *   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). The reaction is A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. By mass balance, A1 must be **SbF₅**. A1 also oxidizes xenon, which is a known property of the extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent SbF₅. (Note: The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" contradicts the known properties of pure SbF₅, which is a colorless liquid/solid stable at that temperature. This is likely an error or misleading information in the problem statement).\n    *   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and it also interacts with xenon. Fluorination of Sb with excess fluorine produces SbF₅, which reacts with xenon. So, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and its molecular weight.**\n    The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. A4 is one of the binary fluorides of Antimony. The two main possibilities are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n    *   M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n    *   M(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**\n\n    Now let's check the given answer ranges:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 220-240\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly into range **C) 160-180**.\n    The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any of the ranges. It is closest to D, but outside the specified limits.\n\n    This provides strong evidence that **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n4.  **Final consistency check.**\n    The problem states \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" With A4=SbF₃ and Y=Sb, the reaction is `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. The stoichiometry of known reactions (e.g., `2Sb + SbF₃ → 3SbF`) does not match the 1:1 ratio. Similar to the properties of A1, this part of the problem statement may be flawed or refer to an obscure reaction. However, the numerical fit from the mass percentage of A2 and the molecular weight of A4 with the given options is too strong to ignore. These numerical clues are the most reliable path to the solution.\n\nConclusion: Based on the mass percentage, element Y is Sb and A2 is SbF₃. Based on the provided molecular weight ranges, A4 must be SbF₃, as its molecular weight of ~179 g/mol falls into the range 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
