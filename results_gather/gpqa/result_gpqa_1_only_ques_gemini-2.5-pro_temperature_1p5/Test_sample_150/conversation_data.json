    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the given state vector and the observable operator.**\n    The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n    The observable is represented by the matrix `P`:\n    ```\n    P = | 0     1/√2    0    |\n        | 1/√2  0     1/√2  |\n        | 0     1/√2    0    |\n    ```\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvalues of the operator P.**\n    The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator. We find them by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `λ` represents the eigenvalues.\n    ```\n    det | -λ    1/√2    0    |\n        | 1/√2  -λ    1/√2  | = 0\n        | 0     1/√2  -λ    |\n    ```\n    Expanding the determinant:\n    ` -λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) + 0 = 0`\n    ` -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0`\n    ` -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n    ` -λ³ + λ = 0`\n    ` -λ(λ² - 1) = 0`\n    ` -λ(λ - 1)(λ + 1) = 0`\n\n    The eigenvalues are `λ₁ = 0`, `λ₂ = 1`, and `λ₃ = -1`. The problem asks for the probability of measuring the value `0`.\n\n3.  **Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0.**\n    We need to find the eigenvector `|E₀⟩` that satisfies the equation `P|E₀⟩ = 0|E₀⟩`, which simplifies to `P|E₀⟩ = 0`.\n    Let `|E₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    ```\n    | 0     1/√2    0    | | x |   | 0 |\n    | 1/√2  0     1/√2  | | y | = | 0 |\n    | 0     1/√2    0    | | z |   | 0 |\n    ```\n    This leads to the system of equations:\n    *   `(1/√2)y = 0  =>  y = 0`\n    *   `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  =>  x + z = 0  =>  x = -z`\n    The eigenvector corresponding to `λ = 0` is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. We can choose a simple representation for this eigenvector (this is an unnormalized eigenvector) by setting `x=1`:\n    `|E₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` for a system in state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n    `Prob(λ) = |⟨E_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨E_λ|E_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n    where `|E_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n\n    Let's calculate each term for `λ = 0`:\n    *   `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n    *   `|E₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n    *   Calculate the inner product `⟨E₀|ψ⟩`. This is the dot product of the conjugate transpose of `|E₀⟩` with `|ψ⟩`:\n        `⟨E₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`\n\n    *   Calculate the norm squared of `|E₀⟩`, `⟨E₀|E₀⟩`:\n        `⟨E₀|E₀⟩ = (1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n\n    *   Calculate the norm squared of `|ψ⟩`, `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\n    *   Now substitute these values into the probability formula:\n        `Prob(0) = |(-2)|² / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
