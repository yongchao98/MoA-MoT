    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum detector resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution limit before it decays. Therefore, we need to find the distance, let's call it $d$, such that the probability of the particle traveling a distance greater than $d$ is 30%.\n\nParticle decay follows an exponential probability law. The fraction of particles that have not decayed after a time $t$ in the lab frame is given by:\n$P(t_{decay} > t) = e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}}$\nwhere $\\tau_{lab}$ is the lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe distance traveled by the particle in time $t$ is $d = v \\cdot t$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. We can express the probability in terms of distance:\n$P(d_{decay} > d) = e^{-d/(v\\tau_{lab})}$\n\nThe term $v\\tau_{lab}$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame, denoted by $\\lambda$. So, the equation becomes:\n$P(d_{decay} > d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n\nWe want this probability to be 30%, so we set:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nSolving for $d$:\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**2. Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe mean decay length $\\lambda$ depends on the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), its velocity ($v$), and the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\nWe can calculate the term $\\beta\\gamma = (v/c)\\gamma$ using the given energy and mass. The relativistic momentum $p$ is given by $p = \\gamma m_0 v = \\beta \\gamma m_0 c$. Also, the total energy $E$ is related to momentum $p$ and rest mass $m_0$ by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom this, we can find $pc$:\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\nGiven:\n*   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\n$pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.784$ GeV\n\nNow we can find $\\beta\\gamma$:\n$\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{26.784 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.8545$\n\nNow we calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\beta\\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\nGiven:\n*   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (7.8545) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$\\lambda = 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**3. Calculate the Required Resolution (d)**\n\nNow we can calculate the distance $d$:\n$d = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$d = - (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n$d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**4. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nOur calculated value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The other options differ by orders of magnitude. The small discrepancy (~9%) between the calculated value and the option is likely due to a slight imprecision in the problem's given numbers. Based on the correct physical principles and calculations, option D is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
