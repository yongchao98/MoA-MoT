    "To solve this problem, we need to use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. The normalization condition states that the total probability of finding the particle anywhere in the space where it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in a small interval dx around a position x is given by the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², multiplied by dx. To find the total probability, we must integrate this probability density function over all possible positions of the particle.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the probability density function |ψ(x)|²**\n\nThe wave function is given as:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe complex conjugate of the wave function, ψ*(x), is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nThe probability density function is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)\n|ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n\nThis is in the form of (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B². Let A = (a / sqrt(1+x)) and B = 0.5*i.\n|ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5*i)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\nSince i² = -1:\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**Step 2: Apply the normalization condition**\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density function over this interval must be equal to 1.\n\n∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n∫₁³ [ a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1\n\n**Step 3: Solve the integral**\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫₁³ [ a² / (1 + x) ] dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nLet's evaluate each part:\nThe first part is: ∫₁³ [ a² / (1 + x) ] dx = a² * [ ln(1 + x) ] from 1 to 3\n= a² * [ ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) ]\n= a² * [ ln(4) - ln(2) ]\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\nThe second part is: ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = [ 0.25x ] from 1 to 3\n= 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1\n= 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\nNow, combine the results and set them equal to 1:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \"a\"**\n\nNow we solve the equation for the constant 'a':\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\nNow, take the square root to find 'a':\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is very close to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>"
