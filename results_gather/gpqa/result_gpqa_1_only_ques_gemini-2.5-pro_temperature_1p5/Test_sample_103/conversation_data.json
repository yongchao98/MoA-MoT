    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate the Observable to the Star's Velocity:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. The wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (V_r) along our line of sight:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = V_r / c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift for each system. This amplitude corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude, K.\n    Therefore, the RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured wavelength shift amplitude Δλ.\n    K ∝ Δλ\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes:**\n    For Planet #1, the shift amplitude is Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ.\n    For Planet #2, the shift amplitude is Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ.\n\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **Find the Physical Relationship between K and Orbital Period P:**\n    The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K of a star hosting a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) is given by:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)\n\n    Let's analyze the terms based on the problem statement:\n    *   **P:** The orbital period. This is what we need to compare.\n    *   **M_p:** The planet's mass. We are told the planets have similar masses (M_p1 ≈ M_p2).\n    *   **M_star:** The star's mass. We are told the stars have exactly the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2).\n    *   **i:** The inclination of the orbit. We are not given this, but since it is not mentioned, we assume the viewing conditions (sin(i)) are comparable for both systems.\n    *   **G:** The gravitational constant, which is a constant.\n    *   Since the stars are Sun-like and the planets are Neptune-like, M_star >> M_p, so the term (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.\n\n    Since M_star, M_p, and sin(i) are treated as being the same for both systems, we can see that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period P:\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    We can write the relationship between the two systems as:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    Now, substitute the value for the ratio of the K's we found in step 2:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. So we take the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated value is approximately 0.36. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
