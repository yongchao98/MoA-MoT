    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Radius**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / 4 )^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Star's temperature\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   A = Planet's albedo (reflectivity)\n*   a = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital radius for a circular orbit)\n\nIn this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant. We are also told that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n\nThis means the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets (let's say planet *i* and planet *j*) is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital radii:\n\nT_eq_i / T_eq_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i)\n\n**2. Calculate the Ratios of the Orbital Radii**\n\nWe can use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the orbital radii.\n\n*   **Between Planet1 and Planet2:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n    Squaring both sides of the relationship T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1):\n    (a2 / a1) = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 ≈ 1.4^2 = 1.96\n\n*   **Between Planet2 and Planet3:**\n    T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n    Squaring both sides of the relationship T_eq2 / T_eq3 = sqrt(a3 / a2):\n    (a3 / a2) = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2 ≈ 2.3^2 = 5.29\n\n**3. Find the Overall Ratio of Orbital Radii (a3 / a1)**\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital radius of Planet3 to that of Planet1, we can multiply the two ratios we just calculated:\n\na3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1)\na3 / a1 ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n**4. Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Period Ratio**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the periods for two planets is:\n\nP_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2)\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1):\n\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Result**\n\nSubstitute the value of (a3 / a1) we found in step 3:\n\nP3 / P1 ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2)\nP3 / P1 ≈ (10.3684)^1.5\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.385\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planet masses and the TTV detection method is extra information not required for this calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the options provided:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 10.4\nC) ~ 3.2\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nThe calculated factor is ~33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
