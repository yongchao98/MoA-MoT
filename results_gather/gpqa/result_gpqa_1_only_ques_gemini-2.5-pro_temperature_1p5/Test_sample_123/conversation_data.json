    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the required Lorentz factor.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Radioactive Decay:** The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame (proper time) is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The time `t_lab` measured in the laboratory frame (where the detector is stationary) is longer than the proper time `t` experienced by the moving particle. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `t_lab = γ * t`\n    This means the proper time experienced by the particle is `t = t_lab / γ`.\n\n*   **Travel Time in the Lab:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n**2. Formulate the Survival Equation**\n\nBy substituting the expressions for time into the decay law, we can find the fraction of particles surviving the trip to the detector wall as a function of the lab-frame parameters:\n`N/N₀ = e^(-(t_lab / γ) / τ) = e^(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\nThe term `c * τ` is the particle's mean proper decay length, and `γ * c * τ` is its mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n**3. Analyze the Initial Scenario**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Detector radius `R = 30 m`\n*   Initial Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Initial survival fraction `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n`1/3 = e^(-R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown `τ`, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -R / (c * γ₁ * τ)`\n`-ln(3) = -R / (c * γ₁ * τ)`\n`ln(3) = R / (c * γ₁ * τ)`\n\nThis equation relates the known quantities to the constant term `R/(cτ)`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Target Scenario**\n\nWe need to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` that results in a survival fraction of `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`.\n\nUsing the same survival equation:\n`2/3 = e^(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n`ln(3/2) = R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n\n**5. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nWe now have two equations:\n1.  `ln(3) = R / (c * γ₁ * τ)`\n2.  `ln(3/2) = R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n\nLet's rearrange both to isolate the constant term `R/(cτ)`:\n1.  `R / (cτ) = γ₁ * ln(3)`\n2.  `R / (cτ) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSince `R/(cτ)` is the same in both scenarios, we can set the right sides of the equations equal to each other:\n`γ₂ * ln(3/2) = γ₁ * ln(3)`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nSubstitute the known value `γ₁ = 20` and the approximate values for the logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n`γ₂ = 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
