    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   Each of these CH₂ groups is positioned between two carbonyl groups, making their hydrogens (alpha-hydrogens) very acidic.\n    *   Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerism. Its most stable tautomer is actually the aromatic compound phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one with the OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule has a C=C double bond. The carbons involved in the double bond are each bonded to only three groups, so they cannot be chiral centers. There are no other carbons that could be chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism (though it does exhibit geometric isomerism).\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
