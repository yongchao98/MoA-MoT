    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate will then act as a nucleophile and add to the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate (the nucleophile):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group), so it has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   C6 has one methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract a proton from C6. This leads to the formation of a single regioisomeric enolate. The double bond of the enolate forms between C1 and C6.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The π electrons from the acrylate's C=C double bond shift to form an ester enolate intermediate.\n\n4.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The ester enolate intermediate is protonated during the aqueous workup (or by the t-butanol formed in the first step) to give the final product, A.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Identify the Product A:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl acrylate chain (now -CH₂CH₂COOEt) attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n    *   Let's analyze the IUPAC name of this product. The options name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   The base chain is \"ethyl ...propanoate\". The ring is attached at position 3 of the propanoate.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment is C1.\n    *   Our product structure has the following features on the ring, using the new numbering system for the name:\n        *   C1: Point of attachment to the propanoate chain; also has a methyl group (the original C6-methyl).\n        *   C2: The keto group (=O) (the original C1).\n        *   C3: An ethyl group and a methyl group (the original C2 substituents).\n    *   Combining these parts gives the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and B. The name in options C and D suggests a \"4-oxocyclohexyl\" ring, meaning the keto group is at C4 relative to the attachment point. This would be the product of a different reaction, not a standard Michael addition. Thus, options C and D are incorrect for product A.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is another Michael addition. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a base that deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. The resulting carbanion (nitronate anion) attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   The hydrogens on the carbon atom attached to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂) are acidic.\n    *   KOH removes one of these α-hydrogens to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion: CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product, B.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Identify the Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon of the nitrile (-CN) group.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)\n    *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The systematic name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and D. The name in options B and C, \"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile,\" corresponds to a product that would be formed from different starting materials (e.g., nitromethane and 3-methylbut-2-enenitrile).\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The major product of the first reaction (A) is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The major product of the second reaction (B) is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThe correct choice is the one that has both product structures correct. This is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
