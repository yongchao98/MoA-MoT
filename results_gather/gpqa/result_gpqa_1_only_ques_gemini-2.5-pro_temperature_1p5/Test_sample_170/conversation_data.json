    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring (C₆H₅-X) determines two things:\n*   **Reactivity:** Activating groups increase the reaction rate, while deactivating groups decrease it.\n*   **Directing Effect (Regioselectivity):** Substituents direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) to specific positions.\n    *   **Ortho/Para Directors:** These direct the electrophile to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to the substituent. This group includes activators (like alkyl groups) and weak deactivators (halogens).\n    *   **Meta Directors:** These direct the electrophile to the meta position. This group includes moderate and strong deactivators.\n\nThe question asks to arrange the substances in order of *increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer*.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, let's classify the six substituents based on their directing effects.\n\n*   **Substances that will give a high yield of the para-isomer (Ortho/Para Directors):**\n    *   1) -CH₃ (Methyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C₂H₅ (Ethyl): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chloro): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n\n*   **Substances that will give a very low yield of the para-isomer (Meta Directors):**\n    *   4) -NO₂ (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl ester): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n\nThis means that the three meta-directing substances (4, 2, 6) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer and will come first in the ordered list. The three ortho/para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields of the para-isomer and will come last.\n\n**3. Rank the Meta Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups (-NO₂, -COOC₂H₅, -COOH), the para-isomer is a very minor product. The absolute yield of any product (including the para-isomer) depends on the overall reactivity of the benzene ring. The more deactivated the ring, the lower the overall yield of products.\n\n*   We need to rank them by their deactivating strength. Stronger deactivation means lower reactivity and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid group because the ethyl group (+I effect) donates a small amount of electron density, which slightly counteracts the withdrawal effect.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will increase in the reverse order of deactivating strength: **-NO₂ < -COOH < -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   In terms of substance numbers, the order is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Rank the Ortho/Para Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the o,p-directing groups (-CH₃, -C₂H₅, -Cl), we are comparing the relative amounts of the para-isomer produced. This is determined by the ratio of para to ortho products, which is influenced by both steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **-CH₃ vs. -C₂H₅ (Substances 1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the ortho positions more significantly, leading to a higher proportion of the para product. Therefore, the para-isomer yield from ethylbenzene will be higher than from toluene. Order: **-CH₃ < -C₂H₅** (or **1 < 5**).\n*   **-Cl vs. the Alkyl Groups (Substance 3 vs. 1 & 5):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is small, but it has a powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I). This -I effect deactivates the ortho position more strongly than the more distant para position. This electronic effect strongly favors substitution at the para position, leading to a very high para/ortho ratio. For many electrophilic substitutions, chlorobenzene gives a higher percentage of the para isomer than toluene and even ethylbenzene.\n*   Based on common experimental data (e.g., nitration is a good proxy), the typical percentage of the para product increases in the order: **-CH₃ < -C₂H₅ < -Cl**.\n*   In terms of substance numbers, the order is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Rankings**\n\nNow we combine the two groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para yield, and the ortho/para directors have the highest.\n\n*   Order of m-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of o,p-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these gives the final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe correct order is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
