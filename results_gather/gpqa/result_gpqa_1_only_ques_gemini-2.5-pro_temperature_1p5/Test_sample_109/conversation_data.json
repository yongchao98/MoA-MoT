    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we need to check two main conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be observable from both observatory locations.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the magnitude limit of both instruments.\n\n### Condition 1: Visibility\nA star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC) and the latitude of the observatory.\n*   **Paranal Observatory** is in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ~24.6° S). It can observe the entire southern celestial sphere and a portion of the northern one, up to a declination of approximately +65.4°.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory** is in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ~19.8° N). It can observe the entire northern celestial sphere and a portion of the southern one, down to a declination of approximately -70.2°.\n\nFor a star to be visible from *both* observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n### Condition 2: Brightness\n*   **ESPRESSO** can observe stars with an apparent magnitude V < 17 mag.\n*   **HIRES** can observe stars with an apparent magnitude V < 16 mag.\n\nTo be observable by *both*, a star must satisfy the stricter limit, which is **V < 16 mag**.\n\n### Calculating Apparent Magnitude (V)\nWhen the absolute magnitude (Mv) is given, we use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (V):\n`V = Mv + 5 * log10(d / 10 pc) + A_V`\nwhere:\n*   `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n*   `A_V` is the interstellar absorption in the V band. `A_V` is calculated as `3.1 * E(B-V)`. If no absorption is mentioned, `A_V` is 0.\n\n---\n### Analyzing Each Star\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = -75°):** -75° is outside the observable range for Keck (DEC > -70.2°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = 55°):** This is within the range (-70.2° < 55° < +65.4°). Visible from both.\n*   **Brightness (V = 16.5 mag):** The apparent magnitude is 16.5. This is not brighter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = 48°):** This is within the range (-70.2° < 48° < +65.4°). Visible from both.\n*   **Brightness (V = 15.5 mag):** The apparent magnitude is given as 15.5. This is brighter than 16 mag (15.5 < 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = -48°):** This is within the range (-70.2° < -48° < +65.4°). Visible from both.\n*   **Brightness (V):** We need to calculate V.\n    *   Mv = 15.5 mag\n    *   d = 10 pc\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   The apparent magnitude is 16.74. This is not brighter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Visibility (DEC = 60°):** This is within the range (-70.2° < 60° < +65.4°). Visible from both.\n*   **Brightness (V):** We need to calculate V.\n    *   Mv = 16.5 mag\n    *   d = 5 pc\n    *   A_V = 0 (not mentioned)\n    *   V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 16.5 + 5 * log10(0.5) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   The apparent magnitude is ~15.0. This is brighter than 16 mag (15.0 < 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness requirements for both observatories.\n\n<<<A>>>"
