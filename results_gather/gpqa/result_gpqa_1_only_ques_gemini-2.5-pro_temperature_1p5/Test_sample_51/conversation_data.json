    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two different energy levels changes. We need to compare the ratio when the star has no spots to when it is 40% covered by spots.\nLet's define the ratio as $R = N_2/N_1$, where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the number of atoms in the lower (level 1) and upper (level 2) energy states, respectively.\nThe factor we need to calculate is:\nFactor = $R_{spotless} / R_{spots}$\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principle**\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere can be assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This means we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the population of atomic energy levels. The Boltzmann equation is:\n$\\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT)}$\nwhere:\n*   $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the statistical weights of the levels (constants for a given transition).\n*   $\\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $T$ is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\n**3. Identify the Temperatures**\nThe problem gives us the two temperatures we need to consider:\n*   The effective temperature of the spotless star: $T_{spotless} = 6000$ K.\n*   The overall effective temperature of the star when it has spots: $T_{spots} = 5500$ K.\n\nWe will use these effective temperatures as the characteristic temperatures for the photosphere in the Boltzmann equation. The information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is used to provide a physically consistent scenario but is not directly needed for the final calculation, assuming we use the given effective temperatures.\n\n**4. Set up the Calculation for the Factor**\nUsing the Boltzmann equation, we can write the ratios for the two cases:\n$R_{spotless} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_{spotless})}$\n$R_{spots} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_{spots})}$\n\nNow, we calculate the factor:\nFactor = $\\frac{R_{spotless}}{R_{spots}} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_{spotless})}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_{spots})}}$\nThe term $\\frac{g_2}{g_1}$ cancels out:\nFactor = $\\frac{e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_{spotless})}}{e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_{spots})}} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} (\\frac{1}{T_{spotless}} - \\frac{1}{T_{spots}})} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} (\\frac{1}{T_{spots}} - \\frac{1}{T_{spotless}})}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Energy Term ($\\Delta E / k$)**\nThe problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of $\\lambda = 1448$ Å. We can use this to find the energy difference $\\Delta E$.\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\nIt's convenient to calculate the quantity $\\Delta E / k$ directly.\nWe will use constants in units that are easy to work with (eV for energy).\n*   $hc \\approx 1240$ eV·nm\n*   $k \\approx 8.617 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV/K\n*   $\\lambda = 1448$ Å = 144.8 nm\n\nFirst, find $\\Delta E$ in eV:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{144.8 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 8.5635$ eV\n\nNext, calculate $\\Delta E / k$:\n$\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{8.5635 \\text{ eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}} \\approx 99379$ K\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Factor**\nNow we substitute the values of $\\Delta E/k$, $T_{spotless}$, and $T_{spots}$ into our formula for the factor.\nFactor = $e^{99379 \\times (\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000})}$\nFirst, calculate the term in the parenthesis:\n$\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66,000}$\nNow, compute the exponent:\nExponent = $99379 \\times \\frac{1}{66000} \\approx 1.5057$\nFinally, calculate the factor:\nFactor = $e^{1.5057} \\approx 4.507$\n\n**7. Conclusion**\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This corresponds to option A. The problem states that the ratio *decreases* when the star has spots (i.e., when the temperature is lower), which means $R_{spotless} > R_{spots}$. Our calculated factor is greater than 1, which is consistent with this observation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
