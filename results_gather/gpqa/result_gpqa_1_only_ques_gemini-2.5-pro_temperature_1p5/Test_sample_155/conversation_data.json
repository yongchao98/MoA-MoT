    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H3O+). This two-step sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene, meaning two -OH groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene stereospecifically produces a **meso compound**.\n    *   Let's trace this:\n        1.  (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → A racemic mixture of trans-epoxides ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        2.  Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of either of these enantiomeric epoxides with water (an anti-attack) leads to the same single product: meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H3O+). This is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene stereospecifically produces a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace this:\n        1.  (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → A single meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        2.  Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide with water (an anti-attack) results in two products. Attack at one carbon gives the (4R,5R)-diol, and attack at the other carbon gives the (4S,5S)-diol. Since both attacks are equally probable, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different molecules (stereoisomers):\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nNow let's examine the relationships between these three isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (they are stereoisomers but not mirror images).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This column separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**. They will elute at different times, giving distinct peaks.\n    *   In our mixture, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diols) will produce one peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will produce a second, separate peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This column has a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, forming temporary diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities. This allows them to be separated.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are also readily separated.\n    *   In our mixture, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will be separated into two distinct peaks. The meso-diol will be separated from both of them, producing a third peak.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard HPLC column and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC column.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
