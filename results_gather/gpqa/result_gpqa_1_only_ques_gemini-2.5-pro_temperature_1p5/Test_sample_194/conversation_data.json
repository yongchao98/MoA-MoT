    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Conditions for Transit and Occultation**\n    *   A **transit** occurs when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view.\n    *   An **occultation** (or secondary eclipse) occurs when the planet passes behind its star.\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation is guaranteed to happen half an orbit later. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum period for a planet that can exhibit a transit.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Parameters using the Impact Parameter**\n    *   The impact parameter ($b$) is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at mid-transit, expressed in units of the stellar radius ($R_s$).\n    *   The formula for the impact parameter is: $b = \\frac{a \\cos(i)}{R_s}$, where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit and 'i' is the orbital inclination (the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky).\n    *   Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, they share the same inclination, 'i'. The star is also the same for both, so $R_s$ is constant.\n\n3.  **Use the Information from Planet 1**\n    *   For the first planet (P1), we are given:\n        *   Orbital Period, $P_1 = 3$ days\n        *   Impact Parameter, $b_1 = 0.2$\n    *   Using the impact parameter formula for Planet 1:\n        $b_1 = \\frac{a_1 \\cos(i)}{R_s} = 0.2$\n\n4.  **Determine the Limiting Condition for Planet 2**\n    *   We want to find the *maximum* orbital period for the second planet (P2). According to Kepler's Third Law, a longer period means a larger semi-major axis ($a$).\n    *   The maximum possible semi-major axis for a transit corresponds to the outermost possible orbital path that still crosses the star's disk.\n    *   A transit is typically defined as an event where the center of the planet passes across the stellar disk. The limiting case for this is a \"grazing transit\" where the center of the planet passes exactly over the star's limb. This corresponds to an impact parameter of $b_2 = 1$.\n    *   So, for the maximum period of Planet 2, we have:\n        $b_2 = \\frac{a_2 \\cos(i)}{R_s} = 1$\n\n5.  **Find the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    *   We now have two equations:\n        1) For Planet 1:  $\\frac{a_1 \\cos(i)}{R_s} = 0.2$\n        2) For Planet 2:  $\\frac{a_2 \\cos(i)}{R_s} = 1$\n    *   Divide equation (2) by equation (1):\n        $\\frac{a_2 \\cos(i) / R_s}{a_1 \\cos(i) / R_s} = \\frac{1}{0.2}$\n    *   The terms $\\cos(i)$ and $R_s$ cancel out, leaving:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5$\n    *   This means the semi-major axis of Planet 2 is 5 times larger than that of Planet 1.\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($P^2 \\propto a^3$). We can write this as a ratio:\n        $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^3$\n    *   Substitute the values we know:\n        $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{3 \\text{ days}}\\right)^2 = (5)^3 = 125$\n    *   Now, solve for $P_2$:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{3} = \\sqrt{125}$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{3} = 5\\sqrt{5} \\approx 11.18$\n        $P_2 = 3 \\times 11.18 \\approx 33.54$ days\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    The maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the star and the planets are extra information not needed for the calculation under the standard definition of a transit limit ($b=1$).\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
