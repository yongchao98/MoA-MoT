    "This is a classic piece of jargon from an organic chemistry lab. The phrase \"on top of each other\" almost always refers to the results of a chromatography experiment, which is the most common way synthetic chemists analyze their reaction mixtures and purify their products.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why the answer is what it is:\n\n*   **Chromatography:** Techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Column Chromatography are used to separate compounds from a mixture. These techniques work by separating molecules based on their relative **polarity**.\n*   **The Visual:** On a TLC plate, different compounds in a mixture will travel up the plate at different rates, appearing as separate spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at the same rate and their spots will overlap, literally appearing \"on top of each other.\"\n*   **The Problem:** When the spots are on top of each other on the analytical TLC plate, it means the chemist will not be able to separate the compounds using preparative column chromatography, which works on the same principle. This is a common and frustrating outcome, meaning the desired product is contaminated with a starting material or byproduct of very similar polarity, and a different purification method will be needed.\n\nLet's look at the other options:\n*   A) While non-covalent interactions are responsible for polarity, this statement is too general. The chemist is complaining about a specific failed *separation*, not just the existence of intermolecular forces.\n*   B) Similar boiling points would be a problem for separation by distillation. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of the visual result of a TLC plate than a failed distillation.\n*   C) Optical rotation is a property measured to characterize a pure, chiral compound. It is not a basis for the most common separation techniques, so having similar rotations wouldn't prevent their separation by chromatography.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is complaining that their compounds (e.g., the starting material and the final product) are not separating during chromatography because they have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
