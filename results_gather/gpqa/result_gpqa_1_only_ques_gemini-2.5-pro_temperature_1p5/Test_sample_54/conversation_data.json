    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the ¹H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n*   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O).\n*   **Integration (3H):** This corresponds to three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group (CH₃).\n*   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons.\n*   **Conclusion:** This signal represents an acetyl group (CH₃-C(=O)-). Since all four options are acetates, this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n**2. Analyze the Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):**\nThese signals correspond to the protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl protons).\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   This is a single proton appearing as a doublet, meaning it is coupled to (split by) one neighboring proton.\n    *   The key information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**. For vicinal protons on a double bond (H-C=C-H), a J-value in the range of 12-18 Hz is characteristic of a **trans** configuration. A cis configuration would show a much smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz).\n    *   This strongly indicates the unknown compound has a **trans** double bond, ruling out Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   This is a single proton appearing as a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet, 'd') and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, 'q').\n    *   This splitting pattern perfectly matches a proton in a `CH₃-CH=` fragment, where the proton is split by the adjacent methyl group (CH₃) and another proton across the double bond.\n\n**3. Analyze the Signal at 1.6 ppm:**\n*   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This region is characteristic of an allylic or vinylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond).\n*   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl group.\n*   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This indicates the methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms the presence of a `CH₃-CH=` fragment.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure:**\nLet's put the pieces together:\n*   We have an acetyl group: `-O-C(=O)-CH₃` (from 2.1 ppm signal).\n*   We have a trans double bond: `-CH=CH-` (from the J=16.0 Hz).\n*   We have a `CH₃-CH=` group (from the 5.5 ppm and 1.6 ppm signals).\n\nCombining these fragments gives the structure for **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n`CH₃(d) - CH(b) = CH(a) - O - C(=O) - CH₃(c)`\n\nLet's assign the protons to the signals:\n*   **H(a):** This proton is attached to the carbon bonded to the oxygen atom, making it the most deshielded vinyl proton. It is coupled only to H(b). This matches the signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)**.\n*   **H(b):** This proton is coupled to H(a) (one proton) and the methyl group H(d) (three protons). This splitting results in a doublet of quartets (dq), matching the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n*   **H(c):** These are the acetyl methyl protons. They have no neighbors, matching the signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**.\n*   **H(d):** These are the vinylic methyl protons. They are coupled to H(b) (one proton), matching the signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n\nThe data does not support a butenyl structure. A but-1-enyl structure would have a `CH₃-CH₂-` group, which would show a triplet and a multiplet, not seen in the spectrum. A but-2-enyl (crotyl) structure `(CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-...)` would place the oxygen on a saturated `CH₂` group, whose protons would appear around 4.5 ppm, not 7.0 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
