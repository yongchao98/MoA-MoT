    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Deduce the structure of the product from the provided NMR data.**\n\nThe reaction starts with compound X (C11H12O) and, catalyzed by DABCO at high temperature, forms a product. Since the molecular formula of X is given and the reaction is likely an isomerization (as DABCO is a catalyst), the product should also have the formula C11H12O. Let's determine the product's structure from its spectra.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d):** This A₂B₂ splitting pattern in the aromatic region is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, represent the chemically non-equivalent ortho and meta protons.\n    *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for a methyl group. Its chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a benzene ring (an aryl methyl group). Combining this with the para-substituted pattern, we can identify a p-tolyl group (4-methylphenyl group).\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** This is a second methyl group singlet.\n    *   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 6.75 (1H, d):** These are two doublets, each for one proton. They are coupled to each other and appear in the alkene region. This indicates a disubstituted double bond, -CH=CH-. The large difference in chemical shifts suggests the double bond is part of a conjugated system. The coupling constant would likely indicate a trans configuration, which is thermodynamically more stable.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7:** This chemical shift is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a conjugated ketone. The ¹H NMR lacks a signal around δ 9-10 ppm, ruling out an aldehyde.\n    *   **δ 21.3 and δ 28.4:** These two signals are in the aliphatic region and correspond to the two methyl carbons. The signal at δ 21.3 is typical for the methyl carbon of a tolyl group, while δ 28.4 is the methyl carbon attached to the ketone.\n    *   **The remaining signals** (δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C)) correspond to the eight sp² carbons of the p-tolyl group and the vinyl group. The four CH carbons of the aromatic ring account for the signals at δ 126.9 (2C) and 129.1 (2C). The two CH carbons of the alkene account for δ 127.1 and δ 130.3. The two quaternary carbons (the aromatic carbons attached to the methyl and the vinyl groups) account for δ 141.5 and 144.1.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (p-tolyl group, ketone, methyl group, trans-alkene), we can assemble the structure of the product as **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    Structure: CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C (1 for Me + 6 for ring + 1 for C-Me) + C (2 for alkene) + C (1 for C=O) + C (1 for Me) = C₁₁ H (3 for Me + 4 for ring + 2 for alkene + 3 for Me) = H₁₂. And one oxygen. The formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches Compound X. This confirms the reaction is an isomerization.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound X from the given options.**\n\nThe reaction is the isomerization of X to (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This means that Compound X must have the same atoms and arrangement, just in a different isomeric form. Crucially, Compound X must contain a **p-tolyl group**.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: A styryl group is phenyl-vinyl (C₆H₅-CH=CH-). It contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n*   B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: This compound also contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n*   C) **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** A 4-methylstyryl group is p-tolyl-vinyl (CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-). This compound contains the required p-tolyl group. Correct.\n*   D) 2-styrylepoxide: This is another name for 2-styryloxirane. It contains a phenyl group. It also has the wrong molecular formula (C₁₀H₁₀O). Incorrect.\n\nOnly option C contains the p-tolyl skeleton necessary to form the identified product.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the chemical plausibility of the reaction.**\n\nThe proposed reaction is the isomerization of 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane to (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. Compound X is a vinyl epoxide. The reaction conditions (a base, DABCO, and heat) are known to promote the rearrangement of vinyl epoxides to α,β-unsaturated ketones.\n\nThe mechanism involves the base (DABCO) abstracting the most acidic proton, which is the one on the epoxide carbon adjacent to the vinyl group (an allylic proton). This generates a carbanion, which then undergoes ring-opening to form a resonance-stabilized dienolate anion. Finally, protonation of this intermediate yields the thermodynamically more stable conjugated ketone product. This transformation is chemically sound.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
