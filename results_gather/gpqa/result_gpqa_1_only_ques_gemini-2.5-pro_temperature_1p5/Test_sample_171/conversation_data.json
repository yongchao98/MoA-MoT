    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels, say an excited state 'j' and a ground state 'i':\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n*   N_j and N_i are the number of atoms in the excited state j and ground state i.\n*   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe term (N_j / N_i) represents the \"excitation\" of the atoms to level j.\n\n**2. Applying the Equation to the Two Stars**\n\nLet's write the Boltzmann equation for each star. The term (g_j / g_i) is a property of the iron atom and is the same for both stars. Let's call the ratio of populations `R`.\n\nFor star_1 (temperature T_1):\nR_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star_2 (temperature T_2):\nR_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n**3. Using the Given Information**\n\nThe problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means:\nR_1 = 2 * R_2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\nWe can cancel the (g_j / g_i) term from both sides:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n**4. Solving for the Temperatures**\n\nTo solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\nUsing the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x:\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\nΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term ΔE/k:\n(ΔE / k) * [1/T_2 - 1/T_1] = ln(2)\n\nCombine the terms in the brackets using a common denominator (T_1*T_2):\n(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\n**5. Using the Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\nWe also know the value of the Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio ΔE / k is:\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our derived equation:\n1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis result matches option D. Since the excitation is higher in star_1, it must be hotter, meaning T_1 > T_2. This makes the term (T_1 - T_2) positive, which is consistent with the fact that ln(2) is positive.\n\n<<<D>>>"
