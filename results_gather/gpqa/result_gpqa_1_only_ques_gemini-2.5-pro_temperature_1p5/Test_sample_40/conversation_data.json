    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n\n1.  **Define the Reference Frames**\n    *   Let **S** be the reference frame of the laboratory where the observer is at rest.\n    *   Let **S'** be the reference frame of the moving glass. This frame is moving with a constant velocity **v** relative to the laboratory frame S. The problem states this motion is in the same direction as the light beam.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities**\n    *   The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the lab frame (S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light *in the glass* is defined by the index of refraction `n`. The index of refraction is `n = c / u_medium`, where `u_medium` is the speed of light in the medium's rest frame. So, in the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of the light beam is `u' = c/n`.\n    *   The problem states to use `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass's rest frame is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   We want to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). Let's call this speed `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n    To find the velocity `u` in frame S, we must use the relativistic formula for the addition of velocities. When all velocities are in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (light beam) in frame S.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (light beam) in frame S'.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Values and Solve**\n    Now, we substitute the values from our problem into this formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The calculated speed `u` is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option D.\n\n    *   A) 1\n    *   B) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
