    "This is a classic problem of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n**1. Initial State (t < 0)**\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2 with magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator. The z-component is μz = γSz.\n*   The magnetic field is **B** = B**k̂** (along the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this system is H₀ = -**μ** · **B** = -γB Sz.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenstates of H₀ are the eigenstates of Sz, which are |+z⟩ (spin up) and |-z⟩ (spin down).\n    *   The energy for |+z⟩ (eigenvalue Sz = +ħ/2) is E_up = -γB(ħ/2).\n    *   The energy for |-z⟩ (eigenvalue Sz = -ħ/2) is E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n*   The lowest energy state is E_up, corresponding to the spin-up state |+z⟩.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n**2. Time Evolution (t > 0)**\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (along the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian is H' = -**μ** · **B'** = -γB Sy.\n*   The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩.\n*   Substituting H' and |ψ(0)⟩, we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB Sy)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBt Sy/ħ) |+z⟩.\n\n**3. Calculating the Expectation Value ⟨μz⟩(t)**\n\nWe want to find the expectation value (the average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is ⟨μz⟩(t) = γ⟨Sz⟩(t).\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| exp(-iγBt Sy/ħ) Sz exp(iγBt Sy/ħ) |+z⟩.\n\nThis calculation can be done in a few ways.\n\n**Method 1: The Heisenberg Picture**\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time. The time-evolved Sz operator, Sz(t), is given by:\nSz(t) = U†SzU, where U = exp(iγBt Sy/ħ).\n\nThe operator U represents a rotation of the spin around the Y-axis by an angle θ = γBt. The transformation for the spin operators under such a rotation is:\n*   Sx(t) = Sx cos(θ) - Sz sin(θ)\n*   Sy(t) = Sy\n*   Sz(t) = Sz cos(θ) + Sx sin(θ)\n\nSo, Sz(t) = Sz cos(γBt) + Sx sin(γBt).\n\nNow, we calculate the expectation value using the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩:\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(0)| Sz(t) |ψ(0)⟩ = ⟨+z| (Sz cos(γBt) + Sx sin(γBt)) |+z⟩\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = cos(γBt) ⟨+z|Sz|+z⟩ + sin(γBt) ⟨+z|Sx|+z⟩\n\nWe know the following:\n*   |+z⟩ is an eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, ⟨+z|Sz|+z⟩ = ħ/2.\n*   The matrix for Sx in the Sz basis is Sx = (ħ/2)[[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So, Sx|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|-z⟩. This means ⟨+z|Sx|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)⟨+z|-z⟩ = 0, since |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ are orthogonal.\n\nSubstituting these values back:\n⟨Sz⟩(t) = cos(γBt) * (ħ/2) + sin(γBt) * 0 = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n\nThe average of the z-component of the moment is:\n⟨μz⟩(t) = γ⟨Sz⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)\n\n**4. Determining the Oscillation Frequency**\n\nThe expression for ⟨μz⟩(t) is a cosine function of time: `A cos(ωt)`. By comparing this with our result, ⟨μz⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt), we can directly identify the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is ω = γB.\n\n**Method 2: Classical Analogy (Larmor Precession)**\n\nClassically, a magnetic moment **μ** in a magnetic field **B** experiences a torque **τ** = **μ** × **B**. This torque causes the angular momentum (in this case, the spin **S**) to precess according to d**S**/dt = **τ**. Since **μ** = γ**S**, we have:\nd**μ**/dt = γ(**μ** × **B**)\n\nThis equation describes the precession of the magnetic moment vector **μ** around the magnetic field vector **B**. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, given by:\nωL = γB\n\nInitially, the moment **μ** is along the +Z axis. When the field is switched to the +Y axis, the moment vector starts to precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane. Its projection onto the Z-axis will vary as cos(ωLt). Thus, the oscillation frequency of the z-component is the Larmor frequency, ωL = γB.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<A>>>"
