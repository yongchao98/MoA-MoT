    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine which planet has a higher transit probability.\n\n1.  **Define Transit Probability:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$), assuming a circular orbit and random inclination.\n    $p_{transit} = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n\n2.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:** We need to express the semi-major axis ($a$) in terms of quantities we know: the orbital period ($P$) and the host star's mass ($M_s$). Kepler's Third Law states:\n    $P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_s + M_p)} a^3$\n    Since a planet's mass ($M_p$) is negligible compared to its host star's mass ($M_s$), we can simplify this to:\n    $P^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_s} a^3$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis ($a$):**\n    $a^3 \\approx \\frac{G M_s P^2}{4\\pi^2}$\n    $a \\approx \\left( \\frac{G M_s P^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    This shows that the semi-major axis is proportional to the cube root of the stellar mass and the square of the orbital period:\n    $a \\propto (M_s P^2)^{1/3}$ or $a \\propto M_s^{1/3} P^{2/3}$\n\n4.  **Combine Formulas for Transit Probability:** Now substitute the expression for $a$ back into the transit probability formula:\n    $p_{transit} \\propto \\frac{R_s}{M_s^{1/3} P^{2/3}}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Probabilities:** We can now find the ratio of the transit probability for Planet_1 ($p_1$) to that of Planet_2 ($p_2$):\n    $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}/(M_{s1}^{1/3} P_{1}^{2/3})}{R_{s2}/(M_{s2}^{1/3} P_{2}^{2/3})} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{M_{s2}}{M_{s1}}\\right)^{1/3} \\left(\\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   The stars have the same radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, so $\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}} = 1$.\n    *   The mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of the star hosting Planet_2: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$, so $\\frac{M_{s2}}{M_{s1}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's: $P_2 = 3 P_1$, so $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = 3$.\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Ratio:**\n    $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = (1) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1/3} \\times (3)^{2/3}$\n    $\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{3^{2/3}}{2^{1/3}} = \\frac{(3^2)^{1/3}}{2^{1/3}} = \\frac{9^{1/3}}{2^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3}$\n    $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65$\n\nThe transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than for Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
