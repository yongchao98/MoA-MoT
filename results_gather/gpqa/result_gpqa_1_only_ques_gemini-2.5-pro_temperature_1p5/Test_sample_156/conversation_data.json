    "A) **First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing. You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.**\n\n*   **Rationale:**\n    1.  **Identify the Virus:** A retrovirus has an RNA genome. To determine its genetic sequence, the RNA must first be converted into complementary DNA (cDNA) using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. This cDNA can then be sequenced. This process is correctly described as \"cDNA sequencing.\"\n    2.  **Develop the Diagnostic Kit:** Once the viral sequence is known, specific primers and probes can be designed to target unique regions of the viral genome. A real-time Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay is the gold standard for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of viral RNA. It can detect the virus directly, even in the early stages of infection, making it ideal for managing an outbreak.\n\n*   **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    *   **B:** Identifying a virus based on symptoms alone is unreliable, as different viruses can cause similar symptoms. A nested PCR is more time-consuming and has a higher risk of contamination than real-time PCR.\n    *   **C:** A retrovirus is an RNA virus. Direct \"DNA sequencing\" is not the correct initial step for identifying the genetic material from the virus particle itself. The detection method would also need to be RT-PCR, not standard PCR.\n    *   **D:** This describes designing a serological test (ELISA), not a molecular diagnostic kit. Detecting IgG antibodies is not ideal for quick, early diagnosis during an outbreak because it can take several days to weeks for the body to produce detectable levels of IgG, leading to false negatives in newly infected individuals.\n\n<<<A>>>"
