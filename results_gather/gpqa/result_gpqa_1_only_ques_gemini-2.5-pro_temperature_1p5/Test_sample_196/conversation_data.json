    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the spectral data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks indicate the presence of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, which is a broad singlet far downfield, is the classic chemical shift for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm):**\n        *   The two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) indicate a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n        *   The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n        *   The upfield doublet (7.2 ppm) corresponds to the protons *meta* to the carboxylic acid group (and *ortho* to the other substituent).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, 0.9 ppm):** Let's piece together the alkyl group attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment: -CH₂-**CH₃**.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) with multiple different neighbors. It's likely the -CH₂- from the ethyl fragment, coupled to both the terminal -CH₃ and another group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton suggests a methine group (-CH-) with multiple different neighbors. This proton is at a relatively downfield position for an alkyl proton, suggesting it is a benzylic proton (attached directly to the benzene ring). It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃). They are connected at the -CH- and -CH₂- positions, and the -CH- is attached to the ring. This forms a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n        \n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Based on all the data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reaction and the final product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and, importantly, carboxylic acids completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged.\n\n    **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid  ---(Red P, HI)-->  1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This matches option (C).\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect. Carboxylic acid group is reduced.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is *sec*-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Correct.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material.\n\n<<<C>>>"
