    "This is a classic molecular biology troubleshooting problem. To solve it, we must \"translate\" the provided DNA sequence and see what protein it would produce.\n\nThe DNA sequence is the coding strand (plus strand), which has the same sequence as the mRNA that will be transcribed from it (with T instead of U). Translation starts at the first ATG codon.\n\nLet's break down the sequence into codons (triplets) and translate them using a standard genetic code table:\n\n1.  **Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon, coding for Methionine (Met).\n2.  **HA Tag Sequence:** The problem states an N-terminal HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) was added. Let's see if the sequence matches.\n    *   `ATG` -> Met\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyr (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Pro (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyr (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Asp (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Val (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Pro (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Asp (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyr (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Ala (A)\n    This sequence (YPYDVPDYA) perfectly matches the HA tag. So far, so good.\n3.  **The \"Annoying\" Problem:** Let's look at the very next codons immediately following the HA tag sequence.\n    *   `AAA` -> Lys (K)\n    *   `TGA` -> **STOP**\n\nThe `TGA` codon is one of the three stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it dissociates from the mRNA, and protein synthesis is terminated.\n\nTherefore, the engineered construct will only produce a very short peptide (Met-YPYDVPDYA-Lys) before the ribosome stops. It will not produce the full-length GADD45G protein, which explains why you are unable to detect its overexpression.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** While it's true that there are no tRNAs for stop codons (that's how they function), the stop codon in your sequence is `TGA` (or UGA in the mRNA), not `UAA`. More importantly, the problem isn't a missing tRNA; the problem is the presence of a stop codon where there shouldn't be one.\n*   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** The absence of a linker can sometimes cause misfolding and degradation, but the primary issue here is that the full protein is never even made in the first place due to the premature stop codon.\n*   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what happened. The premature `TGA` stop codon in the construct caused the ribosome to fall off the mRNA, halting translation long before the full protein could be synthesized.\n*   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** As shown above, the translation of the tag sequence results in the correct YPYDVPDYA amino acid sequence. There are no missense mutations.\n\nThe unavoidable conclusion is that a premature stop codon was accidentally introduced into the sequence, causing translation to terminate early.\n\n<<<C>>>"
