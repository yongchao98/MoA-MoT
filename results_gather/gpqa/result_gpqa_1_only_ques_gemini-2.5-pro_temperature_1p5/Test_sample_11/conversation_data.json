    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion into a positive muon and a muon neutrino. We can solve this by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Decay Reaction:**\nThe decay process is given by:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\n**2. Given Information:**\n*   The initial pion (`Pi(+)`) is stationary.\n*   Rest energy of `Pi(+)`, `m_pi * c²` = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Rest energy of `mu(+)`, `m_mu * c²` = 105.7 MeV.\n*   The neutrino (`nu`) is considered massless, so its rest energy `m_nu * c²` = 0.\n\nLet's denote the kinetic energy by `KE`, total energy by `E`, and momentum by `p`.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (`E_initial`):** Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is its rest energy.\n    `E_initial = m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV`\n\n*   **Final Energy (`E_final`):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n    where `E = (rest energy) + (kinetic energy) = mc² + KE`.\n    `E_final = (m_mu * c² + KE_mu) + (m_nu * c² + KE_nu)`\n    Since `m_nu * c² = 0`, we have `E_nu = KE_nu`.\n    `E_final = (m_mu * c² + KE_mu) + KE_nu`\n\n*   **Applying Energy Conservation:**\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_pi * c² = m_mu * c² + KE_mu + KE_nu`\n    `139.6 MeV = 105.7 MeV + KE_mu + KE_nu`\n    `KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7`\n    `KE_mu + KE_nu = 33.9 MeV` (Equation 1)\n    This is the total kinetic energy released, also known as the Q-value of the reaction.\n\n**4. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n*   **Initial Momentum (`p_initial`):** The pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero.\n    `p_initial = 0`\n\n*   **Final Momentum (`p_final`):** The final momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon and the neutrino.\n    `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`\n\n*   **Applying Momentum Conservation:**\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This means the muon and neutrino move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n**5. Relating Energy and Momentum:**\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n\n*   **For the neutrino (`nu`):** Since it is massless (`m_nu = 0`), its relation is `E_nu² = (p_nu * c)²`.\n    `E_nu = p_nu * c = p * c`.\n    Also, since `m_nu = 0`, its total energy is purely kinetic, so `E_nu = KE_nu`.\n    Therefore, `KE_nu = p * c`. (Equation 2)\n\n*   **For the muon (`mu+`):**\n    `E_mu² = (p_mu * c)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    Substitute `E_mu = m_mu * c² + KE_mu` and `p_mu * c = p * c`:\n    `(m_mu * c² + KE_mu)² = (p * c)² + (m_mu * c²)²` (Equation 3)\n\n**6. Solving for Kinetic Energies:**\nNow we solve the system of equations.\nSubstitute `p*c = KE_nu` from Equation 2 into Equation 3:\n`(m_mu * c² + KE_mu)² = (KE_nu)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nFrom Equation 1, we have `KE_nu = 33.9 - KE_mu`. Substitute this into the equation above:\n`(m_mu * c² + KE_mu)² = (33.9 - KE_mu)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nExpand both sides:\n`(m_mu * c²)² + 2(m_mu * c²)KE_mu + KE_mu² = (33.9)² - 2(33.9)KE_mu + KE_mu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nThe `(m_mu * c²)²` and `KE_mu²` terms cancel out:\n`2(m_mu * c²)KE_mu = (33.9)² - 2(33.9)KE_mu`\n\nNow, solve for `KE_mu`. Bring all `KE_mu` terms to one side:\n`2(m_mu * c²)KE_mu + 2(33.9)KE_mu = (33.9)²`\n`2 * KE_mu * (m_mu * c² + 33.9) = (33.9)²`\n`KE_mu = (33.9)² / [2 * (m_mu * c² + 33.9)]`\n\nPlug in the value `m_mu * c² = 105.7 MeV`:\n`KE_mu = (33.9)² / [2 * (105.7 + 33.9)]`\n`KE_mu = 1149.21 / [2 * (139.6)]`\n`KE_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2`\n`KE_mu ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `KE_mu = 4.12 MeV`.\n\nNow find the kinetic energy of the neutrino using Equation 1:\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - KE_mu`\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - 4.116`\n`KE_nu ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\nRounding to one decimal place as in the options, `KE_nu = 29.8 MeV`.\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are 4.12 MeV (for the muon `mu+`) and 29.8 MeV (for the neutrino `nu`).\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nOur calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
