    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nFirst, we need to find the new concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume after adding 20.00 cm³ of water (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final concentration of acetic acid (M2) = ?\n\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the original acetic acid remains.\n\nAt this point, the solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which forms a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n\npH = pKa + log([conjugate base] / [acid])\n\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base] to [acid] is 25% / 75%, which simplifies to 1/3.\n    [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n\n*   Now, plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.253 or **4.26**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains the conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻, which will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.\n\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n*   First, find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point (Veq):\n    MaVa = MbVb\n    (0.025 M) * (40.00 cm³) = (0.1 M) * Vb\n    Vb = (0.025 * 40.00) / 0.1 = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   Next, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point. The total volume is the initial volume of the acid solution plus the volume of NaOH added.\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    Moles of acetate = initial moles of acid = 0.025 M * 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   Now, we set up an equilibrium calculation for the hydrolysis of acetate. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   Use an ICE table to find the [OH⁻]:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can simplify:\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26** and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
