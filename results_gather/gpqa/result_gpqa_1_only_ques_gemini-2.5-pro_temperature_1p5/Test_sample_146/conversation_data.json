    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Principles**\n\nThis problem can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum from special relativity.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the annihilation must equal the total energy of the system after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the annihilation must equal the total momentum of the system after the annihilation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   We are told the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a standard way of saying its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume the proton is at rest (as in a fixed target experiment).\n*   Therefore, the total initial kinetic energy of the system is approximately zero. The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is the same as the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest mass energy is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Initial Energy: $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n    $E_i = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Since the particles are at rest or moving very slowly, the total initial momentum ($P_i$) is approximately zero.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   All four particles have the same rest mass, $m_A$, with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   From conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. For this to happen, the four particles must move away from the annihilation point symmetrically. This symmetry implies that each of the four final particles must have the same speed, $v$.\n*   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_f = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    $E_f = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy and Solve for Velocity**\n\n*   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n    $E_i = E_f$\n    $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Now, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n*   Finally, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091}$\n    $\\beta \\approx \\sqrt{0.5909} \\approx 0.7687$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of each particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
