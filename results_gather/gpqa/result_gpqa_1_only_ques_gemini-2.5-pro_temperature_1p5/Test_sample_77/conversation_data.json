    "The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nLet's define the terms as given in the problem:\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   `s(t)`: the position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   `r`: the position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `tr`: the retarded time, which is the time at which the field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge.\n*   `d`: the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time, `s(tr)`, to the observation point `r`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   `d`: the magnitude of the vector `d`, so `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   `v`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`, so `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   `c`: the speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   `ε₀`: the permittivity of free space.\n*   `μ₀`: the permeability of free space.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined implicitly by the condition that the signal (electromagnetic field) travels from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r` in the time interval `t - tr`. Since the signal travels at the speed of light `c`, we have:\n`d = c(t - tr)`\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\nwhere the quantities in the square brackets `[]` are evaluated at the retarded time `t' = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)` and velocity `v(t) = s'(t)`, the charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals and evaluating them (a standard but non-trivial derivation found in electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\", Chapter 10) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe evaluation of the integral effectively replaces the volume element `d³r'` with a term that accounts for the motion of the source during the emission of the signal. The result is a factor of `1 / (1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c)`, where `d̂ = d/d` is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position of the charge to the observer.\n\nThe scalar potential `V` is:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c)))`\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n`d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c) = d - (d * d̂) ⋅ v/c = d - d ⋅ v/c`\n\nSo, `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (d - d ⋅ v/c))`\n\nTo match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (qc / (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nThe vector potential `A` is found similarly:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v / (d(1 - d̂ ⋅ v/c)))`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v / (d - d ⋅ v/c))`\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (qc v / (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nIt is also useful to note the relationship between `A` and `V`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ε₀ v) * (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (d - d ⋅ v/c))`\nUsing `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, this becomes:\n`A(r, t) = (v/c²) V(r, t)`\n\nNow let's compare our results with the given options:\n\n**A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c - d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (d c - d⋅v))**\nThis exactly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nB) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r),  A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)\nThis is incorrect. The potential is not the static Coulomb potential (which depends on the instantaneous distance, not the retarded distance `d`, and doesn't account for the velocity correction factor). Also, the relation `A = (v²/c²)V` is dimensionally incorrect as `A` is a vector and `v²` is a scalar.\n\nC) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)\nThis is also incorrect. Although the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` is formally correct, the expression for `V` is the static one and is wrong for a general moving charge.\n\nD) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (d c + d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (d c + d⋅v))\nThis has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-`. The minus sign is crucial as it describes the Doppler-like effect: when the charge moves towards the observer (`d⋅v > 0`), the potential is stronger, and when it moves away (`d⋅v < 0`), the potential is weaker. A plus sign would incorrectly reverse this physical effect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
