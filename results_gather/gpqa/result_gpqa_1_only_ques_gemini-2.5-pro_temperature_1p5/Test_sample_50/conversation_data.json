    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Method**\n\nThe system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`). A grounded conducting sphere means its electric potential is held at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a charge distribution on the surface of the sphere.\n\nThe method of images is the standard technique to solve this problem. We replace the grounded sphere and its complex induced charge distribution with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The electric field (and potential) outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n**2. Find the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` must be placed at a position `b` along the line connecting the center and `q`, such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. The known results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position of the image charge (from the center):** `b = R^2/d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is inside the sphere (`b < R` since `d > R`) and has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Potential Energy**\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of the system. Both should give the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Using the formula U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i**\n\nThe total electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nOur system consists of the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere. So, the formula becomes:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`\n\n*   `V_sphere`: The potential of the sphere is 0 because it is grounded. So, the second term is zero.\n*   `V_at_q`: This is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charge on the sphere.\n\nUsing the method of images, this potential is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\nThe distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n\nSo, `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n`q' = -qR/d`\n\n`V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Calculating the Work Done**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` while the sphere remains grounded.\n`U = W_ext = -W_field = ∫_d^∞ F(x) dx`\nHere, `F(x)` is the force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere. This force is due to the induced charges on the sphere. Using the image method, this is simply the Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'(x)`.\n\nAt a general position `x`:\n*   Image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n*   Image position `b(x) = R^2/x`\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x = (x^2 - R^2)/x`\n\nThe force on `q` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R/x * x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow we integrate this force to find the potential energy:\n`U = ∫_d^∞ [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = -k * q^2 * R ∫_d^∞ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, use the substitution:\n`u = x^2 - R^2`\n`du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du/2`\nThe limits of integration change from `x = d → u = d^2 - R^2` and `x = ∞ → u = ∞`.\n\n`U = -k * q^2 * R ∫_(d^2-R^2)^∞ (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/u ]` from `d^2-R^2` to `∞`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ lim_(u→∞)(-1/u) - (-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ 0 + 1 / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system.\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
