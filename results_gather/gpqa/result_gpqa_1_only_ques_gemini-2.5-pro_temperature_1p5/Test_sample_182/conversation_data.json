    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to identify the reactant and the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Structure of the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is the primary functional group, so it is located at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position 5.\n\nThe structure of the reactant has:\n*   One ring.\n*   One C=C double bond within the ring.\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl (aldehyde) group.\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\nFor the reactant:\nIHD = (1 ring) + (1 C=C in ring) + (1 C=O in COOH) + (1 C=O in CHO) + (1 C=C in vinyl) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n**2. The Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effects are:\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkyl group (-CH3).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) completely to the corresponding alkyl group (-CH3).\n*   It reduces ketones (>C=O) to the corresponding alkane group (>CH2).\n*   It reduces alcohols (-OH) to alkanes (-H).\n*   It reduces (saturates) carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds (C≡C) to single bonds.\n*   Importantly, it does not break carbon-carbon single bonds, so the ring structure of the cyclohexane skeleton remains intact.\n\n**3. Structure of the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of red P / HI to our reactant:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) at C2 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, making the ring a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\nAll the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) in the molecule are reduced to single bonds. All oxygen atoms are removed. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the ring itself.\n\n**4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product**\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has:\n*   One ring.\n*   Zero pi bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD (product) = (1 ring) + (0 π bonds) = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can track the change in IHD:\n*   Initial IHD = 5 (1 ring + 4 π bonds).\n*   The reaction removes all 4 π bonds.\n*   Change in IHD = -4.\n*   Final IHD = Initial IHD - (number of π bonds reduced) = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\nThe molecular formula approach also confirms this.\nThe reactant has 10 carbon atoms (6 in ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl). So, C=10.\nThe reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms.\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cycloalkane) with 10 carbon atoms.\nThe general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\nSo, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\nThe IHD for a molecule C_x H_y is calculated as: IHD = x - y/2 + 1.\nIHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
