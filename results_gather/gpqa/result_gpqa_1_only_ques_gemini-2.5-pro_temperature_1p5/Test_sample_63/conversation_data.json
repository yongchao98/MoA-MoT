    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes the analysis of the gaseous products formed when the salt mixture is heated. Let's determine the identity and amount of each gas.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂).\n    *   Weight change = 0 g.\n    *   This means no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas that reacted are: Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol O / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* Another gas that could react is N₂O (dinitrogen monoxide), via Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. In this case, 0.05 mol of N₂O would have reacted to provide 0.05 mol of O atoms. We will keep this in mind.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that passed through all tubes without reacting.\n    *   Volume of C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C is non-acidic, not water, and doesn't react with hot copper (or is the product of a reaction with copper). The most likely candidate, given that we are dealing with salts, is nitrogen gas (N₂), which is very inert.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nThe elements in the original salts must be the same as the elements in the gaseous products. Let's find the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** All O comes from H₂O and the O₂ that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol H₂O × (1 mol O / 1 mol H₂O) + 0.05 mol O (from tube 3) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** Assuming gas C is N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N.\n\nNow, let's verify these amounts by calculating the total mass and comparing it to the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass = 0.40 g + 4.00 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial weight of the mixture perfectly. Our assumptions about the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the mixture is equimolar (moles of A = moles of B = n) and contains only H, N, and O atoms. The total mole ratio of elements in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To get integers, multiply by 20: 8 : 4 : 5.\n\nThe combined formula of (A + B) is therefore proportional to H₈N₄O₅. We need to find two common nitrogen-containing salts (A and B) that add up to this formula. Let's consider ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: H₄N₂O₃)\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: H₄N₂O₂)\n\nLet's check if these two salts work:\n*   (Formula of A) + (Formula of B) = (H₄N₂O₃) + (H₄N₂O₂) = H₈N₄O₅.\nThis matches our derived elemental ratio. So, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\nWe can further verify this by checking the reaction stoichiometry. If n moles of each salt decompose:\n*   `n` NH₄NO₂(s) → `n` N₂(g) + `2n` H₂O(g)\n*   `n` NH₄NO₃(s) → `n` N₂(g) + `n/2` O₂(g) + `2n` H₂O(g) (This is one possible decomposition at higher temperatures)\nTotal products:\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\nComparing with our experimental results:\n*   H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   N₂: 2n = 0.10 mol → n = 0.05 mol\n*   O₂: n/2 = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol\nAll calculations yield n = 0.05 mol, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Salt A (e.g., Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of N atoms = 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Number of H atoms = 4\n    *   Number of O atoms = 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of N atoms = 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Number of H atoms = 4\n    *   Number of O atoms = 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
