    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   DoU = C - H/2 - N/2 + 1\n*   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O), which accounts for the fifth degree.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH₂ group), corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester or an aldehyde/ketone. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, an ester is highly likely.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets implies that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding the ortho protons, causing an upfield shift to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons, causing a downfield shift to ~8.0 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum. Its position is consistent with an amine attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals (a triplet and a quartet) is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) protons are split into a **triplet** by the adjacent 2 protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The methylene group (-CH₂) protons are split into a **quartet** by the adjacent 3 protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The -NH₂ group is electron-donating.\n*   The -COOCH₂CH₃ group is electron-withdrawing.\n*   Placing these groups in a para arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify the Structure with the Data:**\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. This matches. (Benzene ring C₆H₄ + Amino NH₂ + Ethyl Ester C₃H₅O₂)\n*   **IR:** Has an -NH₂ group (two peaks at 3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) and a conjugated ester C=O (peak at 1720 cm⁻¹). This matches.\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   Ethyl ester protons: -OCH₂CH₃ gives a quartet around 4.5 ppm and a triplet around 1.2 ppm. This matches.\n    *   Amine protons: -NH₂ gives a broad singlet around 4.0 ppm. This matches.\n    *   Aromatic protons: Protons ortho to the donating -NH₂ group are shielded (upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm). Protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded (downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm). This matches perfectly.\n\nThis structure is commonly known as Benzocaine. Comparing our deduced structure to the options provided:\nA) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. Contains an amide, not an ester and a primary amine.\nB) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\nC) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester; the NMR for the ethyl group would show the -CH₂- group at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\nD) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted compound, which would not give two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
