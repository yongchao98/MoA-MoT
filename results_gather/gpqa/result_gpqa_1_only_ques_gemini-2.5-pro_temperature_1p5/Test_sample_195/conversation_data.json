    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**\n    In relativistic mechanics, for a particle moving in a conservative potential $U(x)$, the total energy of the system is conserved. The total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$) and the potential energy ($U(x)$).\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $m$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $v$ is the speed of the particle.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy. For a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's Law ($F=-kx$), the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n    So, the conserved total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude**\n    The maximum amplitude is the turning point of the motion, so at $x = A$, the velocity of the mass is momentarily zero ($v=0$).\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Energy at Maximum Speed**\n    The speed of the mass is maximum ($v = v_{max}$) when it passes through the equilibrium position, $x=0$.\n    At $x=0$, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equating Energies and Solving for v_max**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, we can equate the expressions for energy at the maximum amplitude and at the equilibrium position:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    First, let's solve for $\\gamma_{max}$. Divide the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Next, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
