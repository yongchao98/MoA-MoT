    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference and given information.**\n    *   Let the Galaxy's reference frame be the \"stationary\" frame, S.\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta's reference frame be the \"moving\" frame, S'.\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time, as it's measured by a clock moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal.**\n    We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `Δx`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the equation for distance.**\n    In the Galaxy's frame (S), the distance traveled is given by the formula:\n    `Δx = v * Δt`\n    where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Use the time dilation formula to find Δt.**\n    Special relativity tells us that time passes differently in moving reference frames. The time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame (S) is related to the proper time `Δt'` measured in the moving frame (S') by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)`\n\n    First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the formula for `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2^2)`\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)`\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    We can use the binomial approximation for `γ` since `(v/c)^2` is small:\n    `γ = (1 - (v/c)^2)^(-1/2) ≈ 1 + (1/2)(v/c)^2`\n    `γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)(0.04) = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    Using the calculated `γ` and the given `Δt'`:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (Δx).**\n    Now substitute the values for `v` and `Δt` into the distance formula:\n    `Δx = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km`\n\n    *Alternatively, we can combine the steps:*\n    `Δx = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt') = γ * (v * Δt')`\n    First, calculate the classical distance `v * Δt'`:\n    `v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (This would be the answer without considering relativity, matching option A).\n    Now, multiply by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `Δx = γ * (3,000,000 km) ≈ 1.02 * 3,000,000 km = 3,060,000 km`\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
