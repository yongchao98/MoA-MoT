    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   Acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1\n    *   Bromo group (-Br) at C3\n    *   Nitro group (-NO2) at C5\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** All three substituents are in a `meta` (1,3,5) relationship to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, ortho/para-director.\n\nThe key challenge is to introduce the ortho/para-directing bromo group at a position that is meta to the two other meta-directing groups. This often requires a multi-step strategy, potentially involving installing a group to direct the substitution and then removing or modifying it. The presence of steps like reduction (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests such a strategy.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene\nii) Fe/HCl → Aniline\niii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation does not work on aniline, as the Lewis basic amino group reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst, deactivating the ring. So this path is not viable. Even if it were interpreted as N-acylation to acetanilide, the subsequent steps lead to 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, not the target molecule.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (para product is major).\niii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation does not work on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This path is not viable.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene\nii) Fe/HCl → Aniline\niii) NaNO2/HCl → Benzenediazonium chloride\niv) H3PO2 → Benzene. This sequence simply converts benzene back into benzene before proceeding. This is nonsensical.\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option is long and seems convoluted, but let's analyze it step-by-step. The logic here is subtle and relies on isomer separation and conversion.\n\ni) **CH3COCl/AlCl3** on Benzene → **Acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n\nii) **Br2/FeBr3** on Acetophenone → Bromination occurs at the meta position. Product is **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n\niii) **HNO3/H2SO4** on 3-bromoacetophenone → Nitration. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho/para-director (-Br at C3). This is a case of conflicting directors. While detailed analysis of the intermediates shows that substitution at C5 to give the desired product is significant, substitution at C4 (ortho to Br) also occurs, leading to the isomeric product **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, one cannot rely on a single step that produces a mixture. The remaining steps provide a clever way to convert the undesired isomer into the desired product. Let's assume we proceed with the undesired 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\niv) **Fe/HCl** on 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one → The nitro group at C4 is reduced to an amino group. Product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nv) **HNO3/H2SO4** on 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one → Nitration. In the strong acidic medium, the amino group is protonated to form the ammonium group (-NH3+), which is a strong meta-director. The ring now has three deactivating groups: -COCH3 (at C1, meta), -Br (at C3, o,p), and -NH3+ (at C4, meta).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs to C5.\n    *   The -NH3+ group directs to C5.\n    *   The directing effects of the -COCH3 and -NH3+ groups are cooperative, strongly favoring nitration at the C5 position.\n    *   Product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nvi) **NaNO2/HCl** on 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one → The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n\nvii) **H3PO2** on the diazonium salt → Deamination. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Removing the group at C4 leaves substituents at C1 (-COCH3), C3 (-Br), and C5 (-NO2).\n    *   The final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis sequence, although complex, is chemically sound and utilizes all the provided steps to convert an initial side product into the desired final product, thereby potentially increasing the overall yield. Compared to the other options which contain chemically unfeasible steps, this is the only correct pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>"
