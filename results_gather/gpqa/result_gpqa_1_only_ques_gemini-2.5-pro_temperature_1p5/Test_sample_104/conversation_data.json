    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nWe have two distinct physical phenomena that cause a dip in the observed brightness of a star:\n*   **Rotational Modulation by Starspots:** A large, cool area (starspots) on the star's surface rotates into view, reducing the total light emitted in our direction. As it rotates out of view, the brightness increases again. The amplitude of this variation is the maximum brightness difference.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passes in front of its star, blocking a fraction of the star's light. The depth of this transit is the fractional drop in brightness.\n\nThe problem asks us to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce a transit depth equal to the amplitude of the variation caused by the starspots.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Drop due to Starspots**\n\nThe energy flux emitted per unit area of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: $F = \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. The total brightness (luminosity) is proportional to the emitting area multiplied by the flux.\n\nLet's denote the star's effective temperature as $T_{eff}$ and the spot temperature as $T_{spot}$.\n*   $T_{eff}$ = 6000 K\n*   $T_{spot} = T_{eff} - 1000\\ K = 6000\\ K - 1000\\ K = 5000\\ K$\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation will be at its maximum when we compare the flux from the unspotted hemisphere facing us ($F_{max}$) with the flux from the spotted hemisphere facing us ($F_{min}$).\n\nLet's assume the projected disk area is $A_{disk}$.\n*   The maximum flux (from the unspotted side) is:\n    $F_{max} \\propto A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4$\n*   The minimum flux (from the spotted side) is a sum of the flux from the unspotted part of the disk and the spotted part. The filling factor, $f = 0.20$, tells us that 20% of this hemisphere's area is covered by spots.\n    $F_{min} \\propto (1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4 + f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4$\n\nThe relative amplitude of the brightness drop is $\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = \\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}} = 1 - \\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}}$.\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 1 - \\frac{(1-f)A_{disk}T_{eff}^4 + fA_{disk}T_{spot}^4}{A_{disk}T_{eff}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 1 - \\left((1-f) + f \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}\\right)$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 1 - 1 + f - f \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = f \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right)$\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers:\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 0.20 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4\\right)$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 0.20 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4\\right)$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 0.20 \\left(1 - \\frac{625}{1296}\\right)$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 0.20 \\left(\\frac{1296 - 625}{1296}\\right)$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 0.20 \\left(\\frac{671}{1296}\\right) \\approx 0.20 \\times 0.51775 \\approx 0.10355$\n\nSo, the starspots cause a maximum brightness drop of about 10.36%.\n\n**3. Calculate the Brightness Drop due to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light proportional to its area. The transit depth (the fractional drop in brightness) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\nTransit Depth $= \\frac{\\text{Area of Planet}}{\\text{Area of Star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\nWhere $R_{pl}$ is the radius of the planet and $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n\n**4. Equate the two Effects and Solve**\n\nWe want the transit depth to be equal to the amplitude of the spot modulation.\n$\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} \\approx 0.10355$\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root of this value:\n$\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.10355} \\approx 0.3218$\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.3218 is closest to option C.\n\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.11\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
