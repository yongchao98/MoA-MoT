    "To determine the energy threshold for high-energy gamma-rays to have their lifetimes limited by pair production with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to analyze the kinematics of the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\n### 1. The Physical Process\nThe reaction involves a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) colliding with a low-energy CMB photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to produce an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$).\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron is the same as that of a positron, denoted by $m_e$. The total rest mass energy of the pair is therefore $2m_e c^2$.\n\n### 2. Kinematic Threshold Condition\nLet the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon be $p_\\gamma$ and $p_{CMB}$, respectively. The threshold condition is determined by the invariant mass squared, $s$.\n$s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = (p_{e^-} + p_{e^+})^2$\n\nAt threshold, the electron and positron are created with minimum kinetic energy, so the invariant mass of the final state is simply the square of their total rest mass energy:\n$s_{threshold} = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\nThe invariant mass of the initial state can be expressed in the lab frame. Let $E_\\gamma$ and $E_{CMB}$ be the energies of the two photons, and $\\theta$ be the angle between their directions of travel. The invariant mass squared is:\n$s = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\nCombining these gives the general condition for the reaction to be possible:\n$2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\ge 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Minimum Gamma-Ray Energy\nWe want to find the minimum (threshold) energy for the incoming gamma-ray, $E_\\gamma$. This minimum energy will correspond to the most efficient collision scenario. From the equation above, to minimize $E_\\gamma$, the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ must be maximized. This occurs when the collision is head-on, meaning the photons travel towards each other ($\\theta = \\pi$ radians or 180Â°). In this case, $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$, and the term becomes $(1 - (-1)) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this into our inequality gives the lowest energy threshold:\n$2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (2) \\ge 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n$4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\ge 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nThe threshold energy, $E_\\gamma^{th}$, is therefore:\n$E_\\gamma^{th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Values\nNow, we use the values provided in the problem:\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\nLet's calculate the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray:\n$E_\\gamma^{th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_\\gamma^{th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_\\gamma^{th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_\\gamma^{th} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n### 5. Converting to GeV\nThe options are given in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$). We need to convert our result to these units:\n$E_\\gamma^{th} (\\text{in GeV}) = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}}$\n$E_\\gamma^{th} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV = $0.95 \\times 10^5$ GeV\nB) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\n\nOur calculated value matches option D almost perfectly. Gamma-rays with energies above this threshold will have a high probability of interacting with CMB photons, significantly reducing their mean free path and thus limiting their \"lifetime\" of free propagation through the universe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
