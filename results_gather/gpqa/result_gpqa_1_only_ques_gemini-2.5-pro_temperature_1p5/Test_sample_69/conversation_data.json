    "This is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying several unknown substances (A through H) based on a series of reaction descriptions. Once the identity of substance E is determined, its molecular symmetry can be analyzed.\n\n**Step 1: Decode the reactants and products.**\n\n1.  **D + B -> H (1:1 ratio, H is a solvent)** and **F is a strong acid**.\n    From the hydrolysis reaction (3), we form a strong acid F. A very common strong acid formed in reactions involving gases is Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). This suggests that **gas B** is **Chlorine (Cl₂) **, and **acid F** is **HCl**.\n    Now let's look at reaction 4 again: **D(g) + Cl₂(g) -> H(solvent)**. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the addition of chlorine to ethylene to produce 1,2-dichloroethane, a common solvent.\n    *   C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) -> C₂H₄Cl₂(l)\n    This makes **D = Ethylene (C₂H₄)** and **H = 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂) **.\n\n2.  **C + H₂O -> A + F + G (F=strong acid, G=weak acid)**.\n    We've identified F as HCl. The reaction shows that C hydrolyzes to regenerate the starting solid A, plus HCl and a weak acid G. This is characteristic of the disproportionation of a sulfur halide. Let's test Sulfur Dichloride (SCl₂):\n    *   2SCl₂ + 2H₂O -> S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4HCl(aq)\n    This reaction produces:\n    *   Elemental Sulfur (**A = S**), which exists as a solid (e.g., S₈). This matches \"reforms A\".\n    *   Hydrochloric acid (**F = HCl**), a strong acid. This matches.\n    *   Aqueous sulfur dioxide, which is Sulfurous Acid (**G = H₂SO₃**), a weak acid. This matches.\n    Therefore, it's highly likely that **C = Sulfur Dichloride (SCl₂)** and **A = Sulfur (S)**.\n\n3.  **Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B -> Bright red product C**.\n    Let's check if this fits our assignments.\n    *   A = Sulfur, which exists as the solid S₈ crown.\n    *   B = Cl₂ gas.\n    *   C = SCl₂, which is a cherry-red liquid (\"bright red product\").\n    *   The reaction is: S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) -> 8SCl₂(l).\n    The stoichiometry is 1 mole of S₈ reacts with 8 moles of Cl₂, which matches the \"1 to 8 equivalents\" description perfectly.\n\n4.  **C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> Extremely hazardous product E**.\n    Let's check this final reaction.\n    *   C = SCl₂\n    *   D = C₂H₄ (ethylene)\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ -> (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of **mustard gas**. Mustard gas, **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. This fits the description perfectly. So, **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   E is mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n*   Let's analyze its structure. The central sulfur atom has two lone pairs and is bonded to two carbon atoms, giving it a bent geometry, similar to water or dimethyl ether. The overall molecule is not planar.\n*   Let's evaluate the given symmetry groups:\n    *   **D∞h**: This group is for linear molecules with a center of inversion (like CO₂). Mustard gas is not linear.\n    *   **D4h**: This group describes molecules with high symmetry, such as a square planar structure (like XeF₄). Mustard gas does not have this symmetry.\n    *   **C2v**: This group requires a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes. For a molecule like this, a C2v structure would require the molecule to be planar or have a conformation where the two chloroethyl groups are exact mirror images across a plane bisecting the C-S-C angle, and for the C-S-C plane to also be a mirror plane. This would force the alkyl chains into a highly strained, planar arrangement. Therefore, C2v symmetry is not possible for a stable conformer.\n    *   **C2**: This group requires only a two-fold rotational axis (C₂). A stable, low-energy conformation of mustard gas can exist where the C₂ axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. Rotating the molecule 180° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. This conformation is chiral (lacks any mirror planes or a center of inversion). The existence of a stable C₂ conformer is well-established for mustard gas and similar molecules (like diethyl ether).\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate molecular symmetry group for a stable conformer of mustard gas (E) from the given options is **C₂**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
