    "This problem requires identifying the correct starting materials, A and B, that yield specific α-diketones upon treatment with sodium nitrite (NaNO2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water (H2O).\n\n**Understanding the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent mixture of sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) generates nitrous acid (HNO2) in situ.\n\nNaNO₂ + HCl → HNO₂ + NaCl\n\nNitrous acid, under acidic conditions, is used for the oxidation of a methylene (-CH₂) or methine (-CH-) group that is alpha (α) to a carbonyl group (C=O). This reaction converts a simple ketone into an α-diketone.\n\nThe general transformation is:\nR-CO-CH₂-R'  + (NaNO₂, HCl, H₂O)  →  R-CO-CO-R'\n\nThe mechanism proceeds through the formation of an enol, which is then nitrosated. The resulting α-nitroso ketone tautomerizes to an oxime, which is then hydrolyzed by water under acidic conditions to the α-diketone.\n\n**Reaction A: A → 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\n\n*   **Product:** 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. This is a cyclic α-diketone.\n*   **Analysis:** To form this product, the starting material (A) must be a ketone with a carbonyl group at position 1 or 2, and a methylene group (-CH₂) at the adjacent position. Let's examine the possible starting materials for A from the options.\n\n    *   **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one:** This is a ketone. The carbonyl group is at C-1. The α-carbons are C-2 and C-6, both of which are methylene groups (-CH₂-). Oxidation of the methylene group at C-2 would form a new carbonyl group at that position, resulting in 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. This is a perfect match.\n\n         \n\n    *   **4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol:** This is an alcohol and an ether. The given reagents do not convert this compound into a diketone.\n\nTherefore, starting material **A must be 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n**Reaction B: B → 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\n\n*   **Product:** 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. This is an acyclic α-diketone.\n    CH₃-CO-CO-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₃\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material (B) must be a ketone that can be oxidized at the appropriate α-position. We are now choosing between options A and C.\n\n    *   From option A: **B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol**. This is a diol (an alcohol with two -OH groups). As established, the NaNO₂/HCl reagent system does not oxidize alcohols to ketones/diketones. So, option A is incorrect.\n\n    *   From option C: **B = 5-methylhexan-2-one**. This is a ketone. The carbonyl group is at C-2. The α-carbons are C-1 (a methyl group, -CH₃) and C-3 (a methylene group, -CH₂-). The reaction will oxidize the α-methylene group at C-3 to a carbonyl group.\n        CH₃-CO-**CH₂**-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₃  + (NaNO₂, HCl, H₂O) → CH₃-CO-**CO**-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₃\n        The product is 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione, which is the exact product required. This is a perfect match.\n\n         \n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A is **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n*   Starting material B is **5-methylhexan-2-one**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
