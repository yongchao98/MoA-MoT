    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze how each mutation affects the gene's product, the protein. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nA functional protein is synthesized by transcribing the DNA sequence into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translating the mRNA into a chain of amino acids. This process starts at the start codon (ATG) and ends at a stop codon (in this case, TGA at the end of the gene).\n\nLet's break down the intact gene sequence and each mutant sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides) and see what amino acids they code for.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Amino Acids: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly**...\n\nNow let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Change: Compared to the intact gene (ATG TTT CTC GCT), the codons TTT and CTC have changed to TTC and TAC.\n    *   TTT -> TTC: Both TTT and TTC code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation*.\n    *   CTC -> TAC: CTC codes for Leucine (Leu), while TAC codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation*.\n*   Effect: The third amino acid is changed from Leucine to Tyrosine. This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little or no effect. It is not guaranteed to inactivate the protein.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Change: Compared to the intact gene (ATG TTT CTC GCT), the codons TTT and CTC have changed to TTC and TAA.\n    *   TTT -> TTC: This is a silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n    *   CTC -> TAA: CTC codes for Leucine (Leu), but **TAA is a STOP codon**. This is a *nonsense mutation*.\n*   Effect: The introduction of a premature stop codon at the third position will cause translation to terminate. The resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein this truncated is almost certain to be completely non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Change: Compared to the intact gene (ATG TTT CTC GCT), the codon CTC has changed to TAC.\n    *   CTC -> TAC: CTC codes for Leucine (Leu), while TAC codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation*.\n*   Effect: This mutation causes the same amino acid change as in Mutant 1. The effect is uncertain and not as definitive as a stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT ACG CTA CTT CTG**...TGA-3’ (Assuming a deletion of the C at position 7)\n*   Change: This mutation is best interpreted as a deletion of a single nucleotide (the C at position 7 of CTC). This deletion causes a *frameshift*. The reading frame for all subsequent codons is altered.\n    *   Original: ATG TTT **C**TC GCT GGT ACT... (Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...)\n    *   Mutant: ATG TTT TCG CTG GTA CT... (Met - Phe - Ser - Leu - Val - Leu...)\n*   Effect: A frameshift mutation changes every amino acid downstream from the mutation, usually resulting in a completely different and non-functional protein. It often leads to a premature stop codon as well. While very effective at inactivating a gene, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is even more direct and certain in its effect by immediately halting protein production. Given the options, the nonsense mutation is the most \"probable\" to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene sequence. This is the most effective and reliable way among the given choices to ensure a non-functional, truncated protein is produced, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
