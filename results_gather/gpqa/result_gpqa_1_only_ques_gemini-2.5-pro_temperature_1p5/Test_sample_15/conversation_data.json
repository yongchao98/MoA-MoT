    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Typically, this means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$) or a center of inversion ($i$).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:**\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n      Cl   CH2-CH3\n       \\ /\n        C=C\n       / \\\n      H   CH3\n    ```\n    This molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Any planar molecule is achiral.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:**\n    The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the molecule has stereocenters and a specific configuration is being described. A compound that can exist as a single, stable enantiomer is chiral. The name specifies one such enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). The substituents on both stereocenters are identical (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`, and the other `-CH(CH3)COOH` group). When a molecule has two stereocenters with identical substituents, the isomer with opposite configurations (R,S or S,R) is a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and are achiral, despite having stereocenters.\n    The (2R,3S) isomer is the meso form.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It is one of a pair of enantiomers, with its mirror image being the (2S,3S) isomer. Since it is a chiral molecule and is non-superimposable on its mirror image, it is optically active.\n    Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:**\n    The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at a stereocenter (C1). C1 is bonded to four different groups: `-H`, `-OH`, `-CH=CH-` (part of the ring), and `-CH2-CH2-` (part of the ring). A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name refers to a single enantiomer.\n    Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:**\n    This name describes the isomer where the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the ring (the all-`cis` isomer). Let's visualize this molecule in a chair conformation with all OH groups pointing \"up\". They would be in axial, axial, axial positions or equatorial, equatorial, equatorial positions. In either conformation, the molecule possesses high symmetry, including a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry that each pass through a C-OH bond. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:**\n    The structure can be deduced from the name: a cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon of a 3-methylbutanone chain. The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Let's check for stereocenters. The carbon `CH` is bonded to two identical methyl (`CH3`) groups, a hydrogen (`H`), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. The molecule has no other stereocenters and possesses a plane of symmetry in a symmetric conformation. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n-   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** Not optically active\n-   **(3aR,7aS,E)-...:** **Optically active**\n-   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** Not optically active (meso)\n-   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** **Optically active**\n-   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** **Optically active**\n-   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** Not optically active\n-   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** Not optically active\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity, we have 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
