    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the symmetry of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n*   This is the nitration of toluene, an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director.\n*   The reaction produces a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product is para-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene). We will assume the reaction proceeds to form the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** 4-nitrotoluene.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4.**\n*   Product 1 is 4-nitrotoluene.\n*   The mixture of manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a strong oxidizing agent.\n*   This reagent oxidizes the benzylic methyl group (-CH3) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO2) is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** 4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n*   Product 2 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid. The reagents are acetone and aqueous NaOH.\n*   First, the base (NaOH) deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form the sodium salt, 4-nitrobenzoate. It also deprotonates acetone to form the acetone enolate anion (⁻CH₂COCH₃), a strong nucleophile.\n*   There are two plausible subsequent reactions:\n    1.  **Janovsky Reaction (Meisenheimer Complex formation):** The acetone enolate attacks the aromatic ring at a position ortho to the electron-withdrawing nitro group (at C3 or C5). This forms a negatively charged σ-complex (a Meisenheimer complex). This complex would be asymmetric, possessing only the identity element (E), which corresponds to the C₁ point group. Since C₁ is not an option, this path is likely not the intended one.\n    2.  **Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (S_N_Ar):** The acetone enolate attacks the carbon atom bearing the nitro group (C4), displacing the nitro group as a nitrite anion (NO₂⁻). This reaction is driven by the presence of two strong electron-withdrawing groups (the nitro group itself and the para-carboxylate group) on the ring. The product of this reaction is the sodium salt of 4-acetonylbenzoic acid.\n*   Given the multiple-choice options, the S_N_Ar pathway is the only one that yields a product with one of the listed symmetry groups.\n*   **Product 3:** The 4-acetonylbenzoate anion. Its structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylate group (-COO⁻) at one end and an acetonyl group (-CH₂COCH₃) at the para position.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3 (4-acetonylbenzoate anion):**\n*   The molecule has a benzene ring with para substituents: -COO⁻ and -CH₂COCH₃.\n*   Let's analyze the symmetry elements for this molecule. To determine the point group, we look for rotation axes, mirror planes, and inversion centers.\n*   The molecule can adopt a conformation that possesses a plane of symmetry (σ).\n*   This mirror plane contains the C₁-C₄ axis of the benzene ring, all atoms of the carboxylate group (-COO⁻), and the C-C(=O)-C backbone of the acetonyl group.\n*   This plane reflects the C₂ and C₆ atoms (and their attached hydrogens) into each other, and the C₃ and C₅ atoms (and their hydrogens) into each other. The two hydrogen atoms of the methylene (-CH₂) group are reflected into each other. One hydrogen of the methyl (-CH₃) group lies in the plane, while the other two are reflected into each other.\n*   The molecule does not possess any axes of proper rotation (other than C₁), nor does it have a center of inversion.\n*   A molecule that has only a single plane of symmetry (and the identity element) belongs to the **C_s** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is C_s.\n\n<<<D>>>"
