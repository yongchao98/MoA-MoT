    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The aromatic part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR data:** The spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data:** This is the most informative part for determining the substituents.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. Whatever the substituents are, they cannot contain a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a double bond with a proton on each carbon (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **Vinyl-H splitting:** One vinyl-H is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   Let's label the protons: Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n        *   H(a) is split by H(b), so it appears as a **doublet**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three H(c) protons (a quartet). Thus, H(b) appears as a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms one substituent is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This group adds **C3H5** to the formula and contains no -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these -CH3 groups is the one in the propenyl substituent. Its protons (c) are split by H(b), so they would appear as a doublet. This accounts for one -CH3 signal.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the other substituent, which also contains the ester group.\n    *   **The second substituent:** We need to form an ester group that includes a -CH3 group but has no -CH2- group. There are two possibilities:\n        *   An **acetoxy group**: -O-CO-CH3.\n        *   A **carbomethoxy group**: -CO-O-CH3.\n        *   Both of these groups fit the criteria: they are esters, contain a methyl (-CH3) group (which would appear as a singlet in the NMR spectrum), and have no methylene (-CH2-) groups. Both of these groups add **C2H3O2** to the formula.\n\n4.  **Assemble the final formula:** Now, we combine the parts we have identified:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): C3H5\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester part): C2H3O2\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2\n\nThe final chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Match with the options:**\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
