    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field `f`, we can use the Divergence Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f` over a volume `V` is equal to the surface integral of the field over the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume `V`.\n\n**Divergence Theorem:**\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin, and the surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\n**Step 1: Define the vector field and the surface element.**\n1.  The vector field is given as purely radial with a magnitude of `1/r^2`. In spherical coordinates, this is:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  The differential surface element `dS` for a sphere of radius `R` is directed radially outward and has a magnitude of `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. As a vector, it is:\n    `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`\n\n**Step 2: Set up the surface integral.**\nThe integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)` needs to be evaluated over the surface of the sphere where the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n\nOn the surface `S`, the vector field `f` is:\n`f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dS`.**\n`f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\nThe dot product `r_hat ⋅ r_hat` is 1. The `R^2` terms cancel out.\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the integral.**\nNow we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle `θ` are from `0` to `π`, and for the azimuthal angle `φ` are from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nFirst, evaluate the inner integral with respect to `θ`:\n`∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNow, substitute this result into the outer integral with respect to `φ`:\n`∫_(φ=0)^(2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^(2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\nThus, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is `4π`.\n\n**Note on the singularity:**\nThe vector field `f(r) = 1/r^2 * r_hat` is singular at the origin `r = 0`. Direct calculation of the divergence for `r ≠ 0` gives `∇ ⋅ f = 0`. However, the singularity at the origin behaves like a point source, which the Divergence Theorem correctly accounts for by measuring the total flux through the enclosing surface. The divergence of this specific field is formally described by the Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ (r_hat/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`. Integrating this over the volume of the sphere also yields `4π`.\n\nThe result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as `R > 0` and the sphere encloses the origin.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 4 π\n\nThe calculated value is `4π`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
