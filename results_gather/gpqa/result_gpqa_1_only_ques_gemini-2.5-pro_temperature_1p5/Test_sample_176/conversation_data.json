    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, which can be written as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Laws**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L), radius (R), and surface temperature (T). Assuming the star is a spherical black body, the formula is:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most light (its peak emitted wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\text{em,max}}$):\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{em,max}} * T = b$\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. This can be rearranged to $T = b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max}}$.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** This effect describes how the observed wavelength of light changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For speeds much less than the speed of light (c), the formula for the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em}}(1 + v_r/c)$\n    where $\\lambda_{\\text{em}}$ is the emitted wavelength and $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for motion away from the observer, negative for motion towards).\n\n**3. Set up the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n$L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n$L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4) = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n**4. Use the Given Information**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$. So, $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n*   **Peak Wavelengths:** We are told the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This means their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,2}}$.\n*   **Radial Velocities:** $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. A positive velocity indicates the star is moving away from us (receding).\n*   **Mass information ($M_1 = 1.5 * M_2$):** This information is not needed for the black body calculation and is a distractor.\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\nThe temperature is related to the *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{em,max}}$) by Wien's Law. So, we first need to find the relationship between the emitted peak wavelengths of the two stars.\n\n*   For Star_1 ($v_{r,1} = 0$): Since it has no radial velocity, there is no Doppler shift.\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}$\n\n*   For Star_2 ($v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s): Its light is redshifted because it is moving away.\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} * (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\nSince we know $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,max,2}}$, we can set the expressions for them to be equal:\n$\\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} * (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\nNow, from Wien's law, we know that $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}$ and $T_2 = b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}}$. The ratio of their temperatures is:\n$T_1/T_2 = (b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}) / (b / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}}) = \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}}$\n\nFrom our previous step, we can find this ratio:\n$\\lambda_{\\text{em,max,2}} / \\lambda_{\\text{em,max,1}} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\nSo, $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\nThis shows that $T_1$ is slightly less than $T_2$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n$v_{r,2}/c = (7 \\times 10^5) / (3 \\times 10^8) = 7/3000 \\approx 0.002333$\n\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.00937$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\nThis value rounds to 2.23.\n\n**Logical Check**\nSince Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed peak wavelength to be the same as Star_1's, its emitted peak wavelength must be shorter. A shorter peak wavelength means a higher temperature (Wien's Law). So, $T_2 > T_1$. This means the factor $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1. Therefore, the final ratio $L_1/L_2$ must be less than $(R_1/R_2)^2 = 2.25$. Out of the given options, only 2.23 is less than 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>"
