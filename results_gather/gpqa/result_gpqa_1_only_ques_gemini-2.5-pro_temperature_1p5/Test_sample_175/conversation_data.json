    "This problem involves a sequence of two quantum measurements. The total probability is the product of the probability of the first measurement and the conditional probability of the second measurement, given the outcome of the first.\n\nLet the initial state of the system be $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe operators for the observables P and Q are:\n$P = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$Q = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of getting the result 0 for P, and then -1 for Q. This can be written as:\n$Prob(P=0 \\text{ and then } Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) \\times Prob(Q=-1 \\text{ | state after P=0})$\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the probability of measuring P = 0.**\n\nFirst, we need to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Let this eigenvector be $|p_0\\rangle$.\n$P |p_0\\rangle = 0 |p_0\\rangle$\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  $(1/\\sqrt{2})y = 0 \\implies y = 0$\n2.  $(1/\\sqrt{2})x + (1/\\sqrt{2})z = 0 \\implies x + z = 0 \\implies x = -z$\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ 0 \\\\ -x \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose a simple representation, for example, by setting x=1. Let's call this un-normalized eigenvector $|v_{p0}\\rangle$.\n$|v_{p0}\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is given by the Born rule. Using un-normalized vectors, the formula is:\n$Prob(P=0) = \\frac{|\\langle v_{p0} | \\psi \\rangle|^2}{\\langle v_{p0} | v_{p0} \\rangle \\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle}$\n\nLet's calculate the components:\n$\\langle v_{p0} | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2$\n$\\langle v_{p0} | v_{p0} \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 = 2$\n$\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) + (2)(2) + (1)(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the probability formula:\n$Prob(P=0) = \\frac{(-2)^2}{(2)(6)} = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**Step 2: State collapse and second measurement.**\n\nAfter measuring P=0, the state of the system \"collapses\" into the corresponding eigenvector. The new state of the system, $|\\psi'\\rangle$, is the normalized eigenvector $|p_0\\rangle$.\n$|p_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\langle v_{p0} | v_{p0} \\rangle}} |v_{p0}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\nSo, $|\\psi'\\rangle = |p_0\\rangle$.\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on this new state $|\\psi'\\rangle$ and want to find the probability of getting the result -1.\nFirst, we find the eigenvector of Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1. Let this be $|q_{-1}\\rangle$.\nSince Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\nThe eigenvector for eigenvalue -1 is:\n$|q_{-1}\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis vector is already normalized.\n\nThe probability of measuring Q = -1 from the state $|\\psi'\\rangle = |p_0\\rangle$ is:\n$Prob(Q=-1) = |\\langle q_{-1} | \\psi' \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle q_{-1} | p_0 \\rangle|^2$\n\n$\\langle q_{-1} | p_0 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} ( (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1) ) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n$Prob(Q=-1) = |-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total probability.**\n\nThe total probability of the sequence of events (P=0 then Q=-1) is the product of the probabilities from Step 1 and Step 2.\nTotal Probability = $Prob(P=0) \\times Prob(Q=-1 \\text{ | state after P=0})$\nTotal Probability = $(\\frac{1}{3}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
