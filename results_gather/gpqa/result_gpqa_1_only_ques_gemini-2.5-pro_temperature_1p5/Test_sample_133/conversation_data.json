    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to find the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n**1. Understand the Concept**\n\nThe enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of H+ ions reacts with one mole of OH- ions to form one mole of water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is approximately **-13.7 kcal/mol** or **-57.1 kJ/mol**.\nThe net ionic equation is: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Ions**\n\nWe have two acids: HCl (a strong monoprotic acid) and H₂SO₄ (a strong diprotic acid).\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since HCl is monoprotic (provides 1 H⁺ per molecule), moles of H⁺ from HCl = **0.10 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic (provides 2 H⁺ per molecule), moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = 2 × 0.09 mol = **0.18 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = **0.28 mol**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of OH⁻ Ions**\n\nWe have one base: Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base).\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is diacidic (provides 2 OH⁻ per molecule), moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n**4. Determine the Limiting Reactant**\n\nThe neutralization reaction consumes H⁺ and OH⁻ in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Moles of H⁺ available = 0.28 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.20 mol\n\nSince there are fewer moles of OH⁻, it is the **limiting reactant**. This means only 0.20 moles of OH⁻ will react with 0.20 moles of H⁺ to form **0.20 moles of water**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Neutralization**\n\nThe total heat released is the number of moles of water formed multiplied by the standard enthalpy of neutralization per mole.\n\n*   Enthalpy Change (ΔH) = Moles of H₂O formed × ΔH_neutralization\n*   Using the standard value ΔH_neutralization ≈ -13.6 to -13.7 kcal/mol. Let's use -13.6 kcal/mol which often gives precise answers in such problems.\n*   ΔH = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = **-2.72 kcal**\n\n**Note on Precipitation:**\nIn this reaction, Ba²⁺ ions from Ba(OH)₂ and SO₄²⁻ ions from H₂SO₄ would react to form a precipitate, BaSO₄(s). This precipitation also releases heat (enthalpy of precipitation). However, in many stoichiometry problems of this nature, if not explicitly mentioned, you are expected to calculate only the heat of neutralization. The value -2.72 kcal matches one of the options perfectly, which confirms that we should only consider the enthalpy of neutralization for this question.\n\nFinal Answer: The enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
