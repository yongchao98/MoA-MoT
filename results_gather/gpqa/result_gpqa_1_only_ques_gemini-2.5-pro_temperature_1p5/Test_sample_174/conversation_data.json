    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The most fundamental and usually dominant type of radiation from a compact oscillating source is electric dipole radiation. Let's model the oscillating spheroid as an electric dipole oscillating along its symmetry axis, the z-axis. This corresponds to the center of charge of the distribution oscillating along the z-axis.\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle ($dP/d\\Omega$) for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by the Larmor formula for an accelerating charge, generalized for a dipole:\n\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{p_0^2 \\omega^4}{32 \\pi^2 \\epsilon_0 c^3} \\sin^2\\theta $$\n\nwhere:\n*   $p_0$ is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment.\n*   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $\\theta$ is the angle with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nThe problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function $f(\\lambda, \\theta)$. So, we can identify $f$ with $dP/d\\Omega$.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence and Fraction of Maximum Power**\n\nThe formula shows that the angular dependence of the radiated power is given by $\\sin^2\\theta$.\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\sin^2\\theta $$\n\nThe maximum power, $A$, is radiated at the angle $\\theta$ where $\\sin^2\\theta$ is maximum. The maximum value of $\\sin^2\\theta$ is 1, which occurs at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nSo, $A \\propto \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1$.\n\nWe need to find the fraction of $A$ that is radiated at an angle $\\theta = 30^\\circ$. Let's calculate the power at this angle:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\bigg|_{\\theta=30^\\circ} \\propto \\sin^2(30^\\circ) $$\nWe know that $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$.\nTherefore, $\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is the ratio of the power at $30^\\circ$ to the maximum power:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\big|_{\\theta=30^\\circ}}{\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\big|_{\\max}} = \\frac{C \\cdot \\sin^2(30^\\circ)}{C \\cdot \\sin^2(90^\\circ)} = \\frac{1/4}{1} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nwhere $C$ is the proportionality constant.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence**\n\nNow let's find the dependence of the function $f$ on the wavelength $\\lambda$. The formula for radiated power involves the angular frequency $\\omega$. The relationship between angular frequency and wavelength is:\n$$ \\omega = \\frac{2\\pi c}{\\lambda} $$\n\nSubstituting this into the power formula:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\omega^4 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi c}{\\lambda}\\right)^4 = (2\\pi c)^4 \\frac{1}{\\lambda^4} $$\nSince $(2\\pi c)^4$ is a constant, the radiated power is proportional to $\\lambda^{-4}$.\n$$ f(\\lambda, \\theta) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda^4} $$\nThis inverse fourth-power dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is famously responsible for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining our two findings:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function $f$ is **$\\lambda^{-4}$**.\n\nMatching these with the given options:\nA) 1/2, $\\lambda^{-4}$\nB) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-3}$\nC) 3/4, $\\lambda^{-6}$\nD) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-4}$\n\nOption D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
