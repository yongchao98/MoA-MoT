    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. The total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\nThe energy of the system for a given configuration is:\nE = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE):\nZ = Σ_{states} e^(-βE_state) where β = 1/kT.\n\n**2. List all States and Calculate their Energies**\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states. Let's group the states by the number of +1 spins.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are the same (all +1 or all -1)**\n\n    *   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n        E₁ = -J [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    *   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n        E₂ = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    So, there are **2 states** with energy E = -3J.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is different from the other two**\n\n    *   **States with one spin = -1 and two spins = +1:**\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1) -> E = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1) -> E = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n\n    *   **States with one spin = +1 and two spins = -1:**\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1) -> E = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1) -> E = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n\n    So, there are a total of **6 states** with energy E = +J.\n\n**3. Calculate the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states. We can group the terms by their energy levels and degeneracies (number of states with the same energy).\n\nZ = (degeneracy of E = -3J) * e^(-β(-3J)) + (degeneracy of E = +J) * e^(-β(+J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
