    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's first draw the structure of the starting material.\n*   `cyclohexan-1-one`: A six-membered ring containing a ketone (C=O) group at position 1.\n*   `3-(hydroxymethyl)`: A -CH₂OH group attached to carbon 3.\n*   `5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)`: An isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] attached to carbon 5.\nThe positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other with respect to C1.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O\n     //\n  C1--C2\n /    \\\nC6    C3--CH₂OH\n|      |\nC5-----C4\n|\nC(CH₃)=CH₂\n```\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **NaH:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form an alkoxide.\n    R-CH₂-OH + NaH → R-CH₂-O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **BnBr (benzyl bromide, PhCH₂Br):** The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n    R-CH₂-O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl double bond are unaffected.\n    Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine of the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic catalysis to form a C=N bond, yielding a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone derivative of Product 1.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   This is the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **n-BuLi:** Two equivalents of this strong base are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon (C2 or C6).\n*   The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the deprotonated α-carbon (C2 or C6).\n*   **aq. NH₄Cl:** The vinyllithium intermediate is quenched with a mild proton source, aqueous ammonium chloride, to give an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall result is the conversion of the ketone into an alkene. Product 3 is a cyclohexene derivative, containing a double bond where the ketone was. It still has the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group. The relative 1,3-disposition of the substituents is preserved.\n    An example structure for Product 3 is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Treatment of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for several transformations.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen, deprotecting the alcohol.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂-O-Bn] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂-OH]\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. These two groups maintain their original 1,3- (or meta-) relationship on the ring.\n*   The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n---\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The benzyl group would be removed by hydrogenolysis, and the butyl group from BuLi is not added in a Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the benzyl ether, which would be cleaved by Pd/C and H₂.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is eliminated during the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure results from the hydrogenation of both double bonds and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether in Product 3.\n\nThe final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
