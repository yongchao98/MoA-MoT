    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |alpha>\n\nThe given state is proportional to `|ψ> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nIn the basis where `|up> = [[1], [0]]` and `|down> = [[0], [1]]`, the vector is:\n`|ψ> = [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to find the squared norm `<ψ|ψ>` and divide by its square root. The bra `<ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ>`:\n`<ψ| = [(1-i), (2+i)]`\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product:\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\nUsing the identity `(a-bi)(a+bi) = a² + b²`:\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1² + 1²) + (2² + 1²) = (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is `N = 1/sqrt(<ψ|ψ>) = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nThe normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A\n\nThe operator A is described by its matrix elements `Aij`. In the 2x2 basis `{|up>, |down>}`, the indices `i,j` can be 1 or 2.\n*   `Aij = 0` if `i = j`  => `A11 = 0`, `A22 = 0`\n*   `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` => `A12 = hbar/2`, `A21 = hbar/2`\n\nSo, the matrix representation of A is:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `hbar/2` times the Pauli-X matrix `σ_x`.\n\n### 3. Find Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of A\n\nTo find the possible outcomes of a measurement, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of A.\nWe solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\n`λ² = (hbar/2)²`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ₁ = +hbar/2`: The eigenvector `|v₁>` is `(1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n*   For `λ₂ = -hbar/2`: The eigenvector `|v₂>` is `(1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 4. Calculate Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ_k` is given by `P_k = |<v_k|alpha>|²`, where `|v_k>` is the corresponding eigenstate.\n\n**Probability P₁ (for eigenvalue λ₁ = +hbar/2):**\n`P₁ = |<v₁|alpha>|²`\n`c₁ = <v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|) * (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n`c₁ = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)*(1+i) + (1)*(2-i) ]`\n`c₁ = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ 1 + i + 2 - i ] = 3/sqrt(14)`\n\n`P₁ = |c₁|² = |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429`\n\n**Probability P₂ (for eigenvalue λ₂ = -hbar/2):**\nWe can calculate `P₂` similarly or use `P₂ = 1 - P₁`. Let's calculate it for verification.\n`P₂ = |<v₂|alpha>|²`\n`c₂ = <v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|) * (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n`c₂ = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)*(1+i) - (1)*(2-i) ]`\n`c₂ = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ 1 + i - 2 + i ] = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`\n\n`P₂ = |c₂|² = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nCheck: `P₁ + P₂ = 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\nThe probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Average Value of A\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of A is given by `<A> = Σ P_k * λ_k`:\n`<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14)*(+hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7)`\n`<A> = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
