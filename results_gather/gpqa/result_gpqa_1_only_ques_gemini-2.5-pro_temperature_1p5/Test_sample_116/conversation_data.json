    "Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from a chiral axis or plane, as seen in molecules with hindered rotation (atropisomers).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a biphenyl compound, which consists of two benzene rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n    *   The molecule has bulky substituents (nitro groups, -NO₂, and methyl carboxylate groups, -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') relative to the bond connecting the two rings.\n    *   This significant steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the central C-C single bond. The molecule is therefore locked in a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   This twisted molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a type of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        4.  a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. This plane of the molecule is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   It also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Due to these elements of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
