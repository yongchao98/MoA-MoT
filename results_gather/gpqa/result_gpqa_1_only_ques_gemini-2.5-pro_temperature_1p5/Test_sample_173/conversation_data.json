    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the initial and final states**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_{initial} = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. We will call the more massive fragment '1' and the less massive fragment '2'.\n\n**2. Determine the rest masses of the fragments**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragment masses:\n*   One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other: $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations:\n1.  Substitute $m_1 = 2m_2$ into the second equation:\n    $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\n2.  Now find $m_1$:\n    $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33 M) = 0.66 M$.\n\nNext, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 M c^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 M c^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy ($Q$) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy.\n*   $Q = E_{initial} - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $Q = Mc^2 - (0.66M + 0.33M)c^2 = Mc^2 - 0.99Mc^2 = 0.01Mc^2$.\n*   Using the given value $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    $Q = 0.01 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: $Q = T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$, where $p=mv$ is the momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum, $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n*   **Kinetic Energies:** $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$.\n*   Since $m_1 = 2m_2$, the ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which means $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n*   **Solve for T1:** Substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    $T_1 + T_2 = Q \\implies T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    So, the classical kinetic energy is $T_{1,class} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the conservation of four-momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total final energy equals the initial rest energy: $E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. (Here, $E = T + mc^2$ is the total energy).\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. We can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$.\n*   Since $p_1=p_2$, we must have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n    $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n*   Rearranging gives: $E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n*   Factor both sides: $(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (m_1c^2 - m_2c^2)(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$.\n*   Now, we plug in the known values:\n    *   $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = (198 \\text{ GeV} - 99 \\text{ GeV})(198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n    *   $(E_1 - E_2)(300) = (99)(297)$\n    *   $E_1 - E_2 = \\frac{99 \\times 297}{300} = \\frac{29403}{300} = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n    1.  $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n    2.  $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Adding the two equations gives: $2E_1 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV} \\implies E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   **Solve for T1:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy, $T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2$.\n    $T_{1,rel} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value ($T_{1,rel}$) and the classical approximation ($T_{1,class}$).\n*   Difference = $T_{1,rel} - T_{1,class}$\n*   Difference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\n*   Difference = $0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
