    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we will use the principles of thermal equilibrium and Kepler's Third Law.\n\n**Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature Relationship**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula shows that for a planet in a given system (orbiting the same star), the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*). This can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a or T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²\n\nThis relationship holds true because the problem states that the albedo (A) is the same for both planets, and other factors like the star's luminosity are constant for the system.\n\nFrom this proportionality, we can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 (T_eq4) and Planet_2 (T_eq2) as:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a₄)⁻¹ᐟ² / (a₂)⁻¹ᐟ² = (a₂ / a₄)¹ᐟ² = √(a₂ / a₄)\n\n**Step 2: Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (*a*). For planets orbiting the same star, this can be written as:\n\nT² ∝ a³ or a ∝ T²ᐟ³\n\nWe can use this relationship to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4 based on their orbital periods:\n\na₂ / a₄ = (T₂ / T₄)²ᐟ³\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Equations**\n\nNow, substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes (from Step 2) into the equation for the ratio of temperatures (from Step 1):\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = √[ (T₂ / T₄)²ᐟ³ ]\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (T₂ / T₄)²ᐟ³ ]¹ᐟ²\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T₂ / T₄)⁽²ᐟ³⁾*⁽¹ᐟ²⁾\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T₂ / T₄)¹ᐟ³\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ratio**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods (T₁:T₂:T₃:T₄:T₅) as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nFrom this, we can determine the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\nT₂ / T₄ = 2 / 3.5\n\nNow, plug this value into our final equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)¹ᐟ³\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹ᐟ³\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.82998...\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
