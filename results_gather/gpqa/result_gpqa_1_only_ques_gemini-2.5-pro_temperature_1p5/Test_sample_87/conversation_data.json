    "The scenario describes a classic T-cell dependent B-cell response occurring in a secondary lymphoid organ, specifically a Peyer's patch, in response to an oral antigen.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key clues and why they point to a specific process:\n\n1.  **Peyer's Patches:** These are secondary lymphoid organs (Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue or GALT) where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n2.  **Proliferating cell population:** When B cells encounter their specific antigen and receive help from T cells, they form a structure called a germinal center within the lymphoid follicle. Here, they undergo rapid proliferation (clonal expansion).\n3.  **Variable heavy chain gene:** This gene segment codes for the part of the antibody that binds to the antigen. The cells being analyzed are B cells.\n4.  **High variability:** The crucial finding is high variability *among the variable regions* of the genes from this specific population of proliferating B cells. This indicates that a process is actively introducing mutations into this gene *after* the initial B cell was activated.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) Somatic hypermutation:** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs. It introduces point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes. This diversification allows for the selection of B cells that produce antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen (a process called affinity maturation). This perfectly matches the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population in a Peyer's patch.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during B cell development, *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. It does not occur in proliferating, mature B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n*   **C) Class switching recombination:** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the *variable* region. This switches the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG) to alter its effector function, but it does not change the antigen-binding site or create the variability described.\n*   **D) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune response involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It is not a genetic process that affects B cell genes.\n\nThe observation of high variability in the sequenced variable heavy chain genes from a proliferating B cell population in a Peyer's patch is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
