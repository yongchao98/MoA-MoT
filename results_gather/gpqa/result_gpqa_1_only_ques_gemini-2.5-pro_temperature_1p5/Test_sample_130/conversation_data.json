    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Dienophile (the Anhydride)**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   This anhydride shows a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm is in the alkene region. A single peak means all protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR shows one signal in the alkene region (137 ppm, C=C) and one in the carbonyl region (165 ppm, C=O). This means the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n    *   This high degree of symmetry, combined with the starting material being a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, points to **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Structure of maleic anhydride:\n            ```\n              O         O\n             //        \\\\\n            C           C\n            |           |\n            HC === CH   O\n            ```\n        *   It has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent (a singlet at ~7.0 ppm) and the two alkene carbons equivalent (~135 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (~165 ppm). This matches the provided spectral data perfectly.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diene**\n    *   The diene is explicitly named: **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n             C₅H₂\n            /    \\\n         C₄(Me) = C₃(Me)\n           |        |\n         C₁(Me) = C₂(Me)\n        ```\n    *   This is a cyclic diene and will participate in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** product and the ***exo*** product.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product will be the *endo* isomer, formed through a transition state that maximizes secondary orbital overlap. This is the kinetic product. The *exo* isomer is typically the minor product.\n    *   Let's determine the spatial relationships in the *endo* and *exo* products. The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. It has a one-carbon bridge (the -CH₂- group from the diene) and a two-carbon bridge containing a double bond (the -C(Me)=C(Me)- part from the diene).\n    *   ***Endo* product (Major):** In the endo-adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the smaller CH₂ bridge. Consequently, the two protons from the maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_A**) point *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge protons (let's call them **H_B**). Therefore, **in the major product, H_A and H_B are close in space.**\n    *   ***Exo* product (Minor):** In the exo-adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. The anhydride protons (**H_A**) are therefore *anti* to the CH₂ bridge protons (**H_B**). **In the minor product, H_A and H_B are far apart.**\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum.\n    *   Based on our analysis in step 3, the pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) product and far in the minor (*exo*) product are **H_A** (the anhydride protons) and **H_B** (the methylene bridge protons).\n    *   Therefore, the observed NOESY cross-peak must be between the NMR signals for H_A and H_B.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals**\n    *   We need to match the proton types (H_A and H_B) to the signals described in the options. The major product possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **H_A (Anhydride protons):** These two protons are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They are attached to carbons adjacent to bridgehead carbons and carbonyl groups, so they will be deshielded. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable. Since they are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with, they will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **H_B (Methylene bridge protons):** These two protons are on a saturated carbon in a strained bicyclic system. A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm is typical. Although they are on the same carbon, they are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C bond, one is *anti*) and thus not chemically equivalent. They will couple to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as a pair of doublets. A signal described as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these two protons.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The distinguishing NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the anhydride protons (H_A) and the methylene bridge protons (H_B).\n    *   The signal for H_A is a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   The signal for one of the H_B protons is a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: These are the two sets of methyl groups. They are not the pair of protons that uniquely defines the *endo* product vs. the *exo* product.\nB) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This corresponds to a methylene bridge proton (H_B) and the anhydride protons (H_A). Their proximity is characteristic of the major (*endo*) product. This is the correct answer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This would be an interaction between a vinyl methyl group and the anhydride protons (H_A). This interaction would be stronger in the minor (*exo*) product.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This would be an interaction between a bridgehead methyl group and a methylene bridge proton. The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
