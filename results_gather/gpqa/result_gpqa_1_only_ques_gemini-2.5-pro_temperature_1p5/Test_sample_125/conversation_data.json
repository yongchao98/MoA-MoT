    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH₄) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral (at C5), the attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the prochiral carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This means the two faces of the carbonyl are not equivalent, and the hydride will attack preferentially from one side, but both possible products will be formed. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol. These two molecules are **diastereomers**. They will be produced in unequal amounts, but since the reaction goes to completion, both will be present in the final mixture.\n    *   Let's call them **Product A** and **Product B**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This is a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that there is enough reagent to reduce both ketone groups. The reaction goes to 100% completion.\n*   **Product Formation:** Both ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and the reagent are achiral, the product mixture must be achiral overall (i.e., any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and meso-(2R, 4S).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are **enantiomers**. They are produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n        *   Let's call them **Product C** and **Product D**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a **meso compound**. It is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry. It is a **diastereomer** of the (R,R) and (S,S) isomers.\n        *   Let's call this **Product E**.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different compounds:\n*   From Rxn I: Product A and Product B (diastereomers).\n*   From Rxn II: Product C and Product D (enantiomers), and Product E (their diastereomer).\n*   Note: The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers (or more accurately, just different compounds) and will be easily separated by chromatography.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks on a Normal-Phase HPLC Column**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like C and D) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they will **not** be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like A and B; and like the pair (C+D) vs E) have different physical properties, including polarity. Therefore, they **will** be separated and elute as different peaks.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (or different compounds like the C7 products vs the C5 products) have different structures and polarities and **will** be separated.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  Peak 1: Product A ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol)\n2.  Peak 2: Product B ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol) - Separated from A because they are diastereomers.\n3.  Peak 3: Product C + Product D ((R,R)/(S,S)-pentane-2,4-diol) - Co-elute because they are enantiomers.\n4.  Peak 4: Product E (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) - Separated from (C+D) because they are diastereomers.\n\nTherefore, we expect to see **4 peaks** on the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\nAn HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It also separates molecules that are already separable on a normal-phase column (diastereomers and constitutional isomers). Essentially, a chiral column can separate all non-identical chemical species.\n\nLet's count the peaks for our five distinct compounds:\n1.  Peak 1: Product A ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol)\n2.  Peak 2: Product B ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol) - Separates from A (diastereomer).\n3.  Peak 3: Product C ((2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n4.  Peak 4: Product D ((2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) - Separates from C because they are enantiomers and the column is chiral.\n5.  Peak 5: Product E (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) - Separates from C and D (diastereomer).\n\nTherefore, we expect to see **5 peaks** on the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
