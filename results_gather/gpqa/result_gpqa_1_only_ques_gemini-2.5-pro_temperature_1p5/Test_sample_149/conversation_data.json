    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula C8H9NO and its 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 typically indicates a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (1H coupled to 2H).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting means it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which is the aldehyde proton. The chemical shift indicates it is attached to both the aldehyde group and an aromatic ring.\n    *   From these two signals, we can deduce a `-CH2-CHO` (phenylacetaldehyde) fragment. The double bond of the aldehyde carbonyl (C=O) accounts for the remaining 1 DBE.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, strongly suggest a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, which disappears upon D2O exchange, is characteristic of an exchangeable proton source like an alcohol (-OH) or an amine (-NH2). Since there is nitrogen in the formula and it integrates to 2H, this is an amino group (-NH2). The amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring with `-NH2` and `-CH2CHO` substituents.\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's check the formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C8H9NO. This is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The `-NH2` group is converted into a diazonium salt, `-N2+Cl-`.\n    The intermediate formed is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    When a diazonium salt is treated with water (and usually warmed), the `-N2+` group is replaced by a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group via a Sandmeyer-type reaction. Nitrogen gas (N2) is evolved.\n    The intermediate formed is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This aldehyde has acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Subsequent protonation yields an aldol addition product.\n        *   Enolate Formation: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH-  ⇌ [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O\n        *   Nucleophilic Attack: The enolate attacks another aldehyde molecule.\n        *   Protonation: Forms the aldol adduct, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** indicates that the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxy aldehyde will undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated.\n        *   Adduct: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal\n        *   Elimination: This forms a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n        *   Final Product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. The phenyl groups should have hydroxyl substituents, and the double bond position is incorrect.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**: This is the α,β-unsaturated product from the complete aldol condensation. The structure and name match the expected final product.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This structure does not result from the described reaction pathway.\n\nThe final product of the complete reaction sequence is the aldol condensation product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
