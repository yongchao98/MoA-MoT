  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "This problem requires us to deduce the functional relationship between three genes—G1, G2, and G3—based on the disease resistance phenotypes of their knockout mutants.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the provided data:\n1.  **WT (Control):** 100% resistance\n2.  **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance (a partial loss of resistance)\n3.  **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance (a complete loss of resistance)\n4.  **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance (a partial loss of resistance)\n5.  **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance\n6.  **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance\n7.  **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance\n\nWe also know that one of the genes is a transcription factor (TF) that acts upstream of the others. An upstream gene in a pathway is considered \"epistatic\" to downstream genes if its mutant phenotype masks the phenotype of the downstream gene mutants.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Transcription Factor by looking for Epistasis**\n\n*   The `g2` single mutant has a phenotype of 0% resistance.\n*   The `g1g2` double mutant also has a phenotype of 0% resistance. The phenotype of `g2` completely masks the phenotype of `g1`. This means **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n*   The `g2g3` double mutant also has a phenotype of 0% resistance. The phenotype of `g2` also masks the phenotype of `g3`. This means **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n*   Since the prompt states one gene is a TF acting upstream of others, and G2's knockout is epistatic to both G1 and G3, we can confidently conclude that **G2 is the upstream transcription factor** that is required for the function (and likely expression) of both G1 and G3. This conclusion eliminates option A.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between G1 and G3**\n\n*   The `g1` single mutant loses 25% of the wild-type resistance (100% - 75%).\n*   The `g3` single mutant loses 50% of the wild-type resistance (100% - 50%).\n*   If G1 and G3 acted in completely independent pathways, we would expect an additive effect. The expected loss in the double mutant would be 25% + 50% = 75%, leading to an expected resistance of 25%.\n*   However, the `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance, which is a 90% loss. This is a much more severe phenotype than the sum of the individual effects. This type of genetic interaction, where the double mutant is more severely affected than expected, is a classic sign of **gene redundancy**. G1 and G3 likely have overlapping functions, and each can partially compensate for the loss of the other. When both are knocked out, the function is almost completely lost.\n*   Now let's compare this with other terms. \"Pleiotropy\" (Option C) refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits; it doesn't describe the interaction between two genes on a single trait, so it's not the correct term here. \"Same promoter\" (Option B) is a possible mechanism but not a functional relationship that can be concluded directly from this data. Therefore, \"gene redundancy\" is the best description of the G1-G3 interaction.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the options based on these conclusions**\n\nLet's re-examine the remaining options (B, C, D):\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   *G2 is a TF*: Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 has the same promoter*: Speculative.\n    *   *G3 is epistatic towards G1*: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a TF*: Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show pleiotropy*: Incorrect term to describe the observed interaction.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3*: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G2 is a TF*: Correct.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy*: Correct, as it accurately describes the synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` mutant.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3*: Incorrect, as shown above.\n\nAlthough the final clause in option D (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is factually incorrect based on the data, this option is still the best choice. It correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and provides the most accurate description of the functional relationship between G1 and G3 (gene redundancy). The other options contain more significant errors. It's likely that the final clause in the options is flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>"
