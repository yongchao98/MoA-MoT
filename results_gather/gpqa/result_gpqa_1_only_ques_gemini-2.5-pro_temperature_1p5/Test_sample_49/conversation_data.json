    "This is a classic problem of \"dimensional analysis\" in the context of quantum field theory. The key to solving it lies in understanding how different factors in a calculated amplitude relate to the structure of the corresponding Feynman diagram.\n\nThe most reliable indicator of the number of loops is the factor of `1/(4π)`. Let's break down why.\n\n1.  **Loop Integrals:** In a quantum field theory calculation, each closed loop in a Feynman diagram corresponds to an integral over an undetermined four-momentum, let's call it `k`. So, an `L`-loop diagram involves `L` such integrals:\n    ∫ d⁴k₁ ∫ d⁴k₂ ... ∫ d⁴k_L\n\n2.  **The Factor of (4π):** When performing these integrals in four-dimensional spacetime (often using dimensional regularization and Wick rotation), each loop integral systematically produces a factor of `1/(4π)²` or `1/(16π²)`. This arises from the measure of integration `d⁴k / (2π)⁴` and the surface area of the unit sphere in four Euclidean dimensions (`2π²`).\n\n3.  **The General Rule:** Therefore, a calculation for an `L`-loop diagram will contain an overall factor of:\n    `(1 / (4π)²)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`\n\n4.  **Applying the Rule:** Your colleague's note has a factor of `1/(4π)⁶`. We can set this equal to the general formula to find `L`:\n    `1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)⁶`\n\n    This implies:\n    `2L = 6`\n    `L = 3`\n\nThe diagram contained **3 loops**.\n\n*The other terms in the expression are consistent with this finding:*\n*   `alpha^3 * g^2`: These are the coupling constants. Their powers tell you how many vertices of different types are in the diagram.\n*   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are numerical factors that typically arise from summing over spins, colors (group theory factors), or from the specific algebra of the numerators in the integrals.\n*   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of energy scales (e.g., momentum transfer `Q` vs. a particle mass `M`). Such terms, often inside logarithms like `ln(Q²/M²)`, are the typical result of evaluating the loop integrals.\n\nBased on the factor of `1/(4π)⁶`, the number of loops is unambiguously 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
