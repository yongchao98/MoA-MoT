    "This is a classic problem about exponential decay, which is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in the future. The clock essentially \"resets.\"\n\nTherefore, the problem is simplified to: What is the probability that a freshly obtained atom will decay within 150 minutes?\n\nTo solve this, we first need to find the decay constant, λ, from the information given.\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by:\nP(survival) = e^(-λt)\n\nThe probability of it decaying within a time `t` is:\nP(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**Step 1: Find the decay constant (λ).**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP(decay in 100 min) = 0.32\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for the survival probability term:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nThis tells us that the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes is 68%. We can use this value directly without needing to calculate λ itself.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.**\n\nAs stated before, due to the memoryless nature of decay, this is the same as calculating the probability of decay for a new atom in a 150-minute interval.\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe need to find the value of e^(-λ * 150). We can relate this to the term we found in Step 1:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value from Step 1:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nCalculating this value:\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\nThis is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes.\n\nThe probability of it *decaying* within 150 minutes is:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n**Step 3: Convert to a percentage and choose the closest answer.**\n\n0.4393 is equal to 43.93%. This is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
