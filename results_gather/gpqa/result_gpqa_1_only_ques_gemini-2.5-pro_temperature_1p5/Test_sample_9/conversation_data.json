    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the options to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n**Key Concept: Gravitational Compression**\nDensity is mass divided by volume (ρ = m/V). For rocky planets with the same basic composition (like iron, silicon, oxygen, etc.), a more massive planet will have stronger gravity. This stronger gravity compresses the planet's material more tightly, reducing its volume for a given mass and thus increasing its overall density.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially a description of Earth itself. Earth's average density is our baseline, which is approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as 5.5 g/cm³, the same as Earth's.\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Because this planet is much more massive, its gravity is much stronger. This intense gravity will compress its material significantly. Therefore, its density will be considerably *higher* than Earth's density (higher than 5.5 g/cm³).\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is less massive than Earth, so its gravity is weaker. The material will be less compressed than Earth's. Therefore, its density will be *lower* than Earth's density (lower than 5.5 g/cm³).\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   Density of (a) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density of (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density of (c) > 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density of (d) < 5.5 g/cm³\n\nThe planet in option (c) is the only one with a density greater than Earth's. Therefore, it has the highest density among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
