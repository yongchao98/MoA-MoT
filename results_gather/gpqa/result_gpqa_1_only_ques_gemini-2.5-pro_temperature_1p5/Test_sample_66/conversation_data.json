    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. The state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    We want to find the joint probability of obtaining the following results:\n    *   For the first electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For the second electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final State:**\n    The state corresponding to this specific measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    The total angular momentum operators are related to the individual ones by $\\vec{L} = \\vec{L}_1 + \\vec{L}_2$. For the z-components, this means $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship also holds for the corresponding quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$. This is a fundamental selection rule in the coupling of angular momenta.\n\n5.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   For the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state $|\\phi\\rangle$, we would have a total z-component quantum number of $m' = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Since the total z-component of the initial state ($m=-1$) is different from the total z-component of the desired final state ($m'=-2$), the measurement outcome is impossible.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of finding the system, initially in state $|\\psi\\rangle$, in the final state $|\\phi\\rangle$ after a measurement is given by the square of the inner product of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    The term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A key property (the selection rule mentioned above) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is that they are zero unless $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n    In our case, $m_1=-1$, $m_2=-1$, and $m=-1$. Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\nAlternatively, we can reason that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The state corresponding to the measurement outcome, $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Thus, their inner product is zero, and the probability of measuring one state given the other is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
