    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct structure and its corresponding 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. This leaves 4 hydrogen atoms on the ring itself.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR peak for a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **FTIR peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (C-X):** The other substituent is a halogen (e.g., Cl, Br) directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: two carbons and one oxygen in a carbonyl group. The only possible arrangement for a C₂ substituent with a carbonyl group attached to a ring is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n3.  **Consider the isomerism (ortho, meta, para):**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum will be simplest for the most symmetrical isomer, which is the *para* (1,4) substituted compound. A *para*-disubstituted ring with two different substituents will show two distinct signals for the aromatic protons. Due to symmetry, the two protons next to substituent A are equivalent, and the two protons next to substituent B are equivalent. These two groups of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex splitting patterns, not two simple doublets.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (around 7.0-8.0 ppm):** We expect to see two signals, each integrating to 2 hydrogens, and both appearing as doublets. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be the most downfield (highest ppm value).\n        *   A doublet for 2H around 7.8 ppm.\n        *   A doublet for the other 2H slightly more upfield, around 7.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** We have a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a carbonyl. This methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with, so it will appear as a singlet. It will integrate to 3 hydrogens. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n        *   A singlet for 3H around 2.3 ppm.\n\n5.  **Compare the prediction with the given options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This perfectly matches our prediction: two doublets in the aromatic region for a *para*-substituted ring and a singlet for a methyl ketone group.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm indicates an aldehyde, not a ketone. An aldehyde would only have 7 total carbons (p-halobenzaldehyde), which contradicts the problem statement.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals are not in the correct region for an aromatic compound of this type, and the integration (1H + 2H + 2H on the ring) is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nThe correct 1H NMR data corresponds to a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
