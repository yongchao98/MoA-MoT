    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). While alcohols also show a broad O-H stretch, the peak for a carboxylic acid is typically extremely broad and centered around 3000 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The position is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The presence of a broad O-H peak, a C=O peak, and a C=C peak strongly suggests the compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid). A carboxylic acid functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. The mass of the carboxylic acid functional group, -COOH, is calculated as follows:\n        *   Carbon: 12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (x2): 16 * 2 = 32 amu\n        *   Hydrogen: 1 amu\n        *   Total = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   A fragment with m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have concluded the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid**. This means it must contain at least one C=C double bond and one -COOH group.\n*   The -COOH group means the molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms (O₂)\n    **. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with A (C₆H₁₀O₂) and C (C₆H₁₂O₂). To distinguish between these, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for formulas containing C, H, and O).\n*   Our compound has one C=C double bond (1 DoU) and one C=O double bond (1 DoU), for a **total DoU of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This does not match our requirement, as it doesn't account for the presence of both the C=C and C=O bonds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only one that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data: it has two oxygens for the carboxylic acid, and it has a degree of unsaturation of 2, accounting for both the alkene and the carbonyl group.\n\n<<<A>>>"
