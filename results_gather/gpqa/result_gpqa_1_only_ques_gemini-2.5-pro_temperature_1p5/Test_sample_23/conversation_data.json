    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon and is fully saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). This means it's an alkane (CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's check which formula fits.\n        *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H is `(2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2)`. Setting this to 0.1428 (or 1/7) gives `(2n+2)/(14n+2) = 1/7` => `14n + 14 = 14n + 2`, which is impossible.\n        *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`. Since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, this matches the given data (14.28%).\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   Hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a critical piece of information. It means that all the compounds present in both mixtures X and Y are based on the same carbon skeleton, and Z is the fully saturated version of this skeleton.\n    *   Z is described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z is one of the components of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n    *   Let's assume the carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring (n=6). Then Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Y contains cyclohexane. The other component must also have a C6 skeleton, be unreactive to bromine water, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only compound that fits this description is benzene (C6H6). Benzene requires severe conditions for hydrogenation, which aligns with the problem description.\n    *   So, if n=6, Mixture Y = an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is described as a disproportionation. Given that we start with an equimolar mixture X (let's call the components A and B) and end with an equimolar mixture Y (C and D), the most plausible reaction is a 1:1 intermolecular hydrogen transfer: A + B → C + D.\n    *   In our case, with Y being cyclohexane and benzene, the reaction is: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   This means one component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other component is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy.\n        *   Oxidation: C6Hx → C6H6. Hydrogen atoms lost = x - 6.\n        *   Reduction: C6Hy → C6H12. Hydrogen atoms gained = 12 - y.\n    *   For the hydrogen transfer to be balanced, the number of H atoms lost must equal the number gained: x - 6 = 12 - y, which simplifies to **x + y = 18**.\n    *   Now, let's use the other properties of X:\n        *   The components decolorize bromine water, so they must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). This means x < 12 and y < 12. For a C6 ring, the most saturated alkene is cyclohexene (C6H10), so x ≤ 10 and y ≤ 10.\n        *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   A and B must be different compounds, so x ≠ y.\n    *   We need to find two different integers, x and y, both less than or equal to 10, that sum to 18. The only possible pair is **x = 10** and **y = 8**.\n    *   So, the two liquids in mixture X have the formulas C6H10 and C6H8.\n        *   **C6H10**: This is cyclohexene. It has one double bond, is a liquid, decolorizes bromine water, and has no conjugated bonds. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n        *   **C6H8**: This is a cyclohexadiene. To satisfy the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" condition, it must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not 1,3-cyclohexadiene. It has two double bonds, is a liquid, decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   The reaction is plausible: The more unsaturated 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6), and the less unsaturated cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12). The transfer involves 2 hydrogen atoms.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in their formulas.\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nThis result matches one of the options. A similar analysis for the C7 case (Z=methylcyclohexane) would lead to a total of 22 hydrogen atoms (from C7H12 and C7H10), which is also an option. However, the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of chemistry, making it the most likely intended answer in a problem of this nature. The C6 scenario fulfills all conditions without ambiguity.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
