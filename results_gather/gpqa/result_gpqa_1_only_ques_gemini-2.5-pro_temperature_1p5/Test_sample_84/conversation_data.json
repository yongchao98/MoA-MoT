    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n**2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n$T_{eq1} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}$\n$T_{eq2} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. The problem states that the albedos are the same ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nSo, to find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the orbital distances, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n**3. Using Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) by:\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere c is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes for the two planets is:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_0}}{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_0}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nUsing the given values:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n**4. Relating RV Amplitude to Planet Properties**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n(This is a common form derived from Kepler's laws, assuming the planet mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star mass $M_{star}$).\n\nSince both transit and RV methods work, the inclination angle $i$ is very close to 90°, so we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nNow, let's form the ratio $K_1 / K_2$:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\frac{M_{p1}}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a_1}}}{\\frac{M_{p2}}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a_2}}} = \\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n**5. Solving for the Orbital Distance Ratio**\n\nWe can now rearrange the equation to solve for the term we need for the temperature ratio, $\\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}$:\n\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\times \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}$\n\nNow, we plug in the known values:\n*   $K_1 / K_2 = 3/4$\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} / M_{p1} = 5 / 7$\n\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is equal to this value:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
