    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n\n*   We have an electron and a positron colliding head-on along the horizontal (x-axis).\n*   The electron moves from left to right (in the +x direction).\n*   The positron moves from right to left (in the -x direction).\n*   They annihilate and produce two photons of equal energy.\n*   The photons move away symmetrically in the \"upper-right\" and \"lower-right\" directions.\n*   We need to find the total angle between the paths of the two photons.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nThis problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Let $m_e$ be the rest mass of both the electron and the positron.\n\n**3. Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\nThe total energy and momentum of the system before the collision must be calculated. The relativistic energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, and the magnitude of its momentum is $p = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}/c = mc\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n*   **For the electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n    *   Energy $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum $p_e = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{15}$.\n    *   Its momentum is in the +x direction.\n\n*   **For the positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n    *   Energy $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum $p_p = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{3}$.\n    *   Its momentum is in the -x direction.\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   **Total Energy ($E_{total}$):** $E_{total} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n    *   **Total Momentum ($P_{total}$):** This is a vector sum. Since motion is only along the x-axis, we only need to consider the x-component.\n        $P_{total,x} = p_e - p_p = m_e c \\sqrt{15} - m_e c \\sqrt{3} = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})$.\n        The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n\n**4. Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\nThe annihilation produces two photons with equal energy. Let's call the energy of each photon $E_{ph}$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total final energy is $E_{ph} + E_{ph} = 2E_{ph}$.\n    *   $E_{total, initial} = E_{total, final} \\Rightarrow 6 m_e c^2 = 2 E_{ph}$.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is $E_{ph} = 3 m_e c^2$.\n\n*   **Momentum of Each Photon:**\n    *   For a photon, the momentum magnitude is $p = E/c$.\n    *   So, for each of our photons, $p_{ph} = \\frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Since the initial momentum in the y-direction was zero, the total y-momentum of the two photons must also be zero. This means they must travel at equal and opposite angles to the x-axis. Let's call this angle $\\theta$. One photon travels at $+\\theta$ and the other at $-\\theta$.\n    *   The total x-momentum of the final system is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum:\n        $P_{final,x} = p_{ph} \\cos(\\theta) + p_{ph} \\cos(-\\theta) = 2 p_{ph} \\cos(\\theta)$.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nNow we equate the initial and final x-momentum:\n$P_{total,x} = P_{final,x}$\n$m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) = 2 p_{ph} \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nSubstitute the value we found for $p_{ph}$:\n$m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos(\\theta)$\n$m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) = 6 m_e c \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nCancel out the common term $m_e c$:\n$\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos(\\theta)$\n$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\nNow, we calculate the value:\n$\\cos(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n$\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$\n\n**6. Find the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons. Since one moves at an angle $\\theta$ above the horizontal axis and the other moves at an angle $\\theta$ below it, the total angle between them is $2\\theta$.\n\nTotal Angle = $2 \\times \\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ \\approx 138.2^\\circ$.\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
