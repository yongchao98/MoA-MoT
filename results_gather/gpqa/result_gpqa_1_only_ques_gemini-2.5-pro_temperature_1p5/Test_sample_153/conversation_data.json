    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at **m/z = 156**. This represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at **m/z = 158** with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M+2 ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1) is a distinct isotopic pattern indicating the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl have a natural abundance ratio of roughly 3:1).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options:\n        *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n        *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n        *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW = 156.57 g/mol.\n    *   All four options have the correct molecular weight and contain one chlorine atom. The MS data is consistent with all of them.\n\n2.  **Infrared Spectroscopy (IR):**\n    *   A **very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A **strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This value falls squarely in the range for a carboxylic acid carbonyl (~1725-1700 cm⁻¹).\n    *   This combination of peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This eliminates options **C** (which is a chloroformate, lacking an O-H group) and **D** (which has an aldehyde C=O and a phenol O-H, whose O-H stretch is typically narrower than that of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A and B.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR):**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, in the region characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. The integration of 1H confirms this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   Let's compare this NMR data with the remaining options:\n        *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) ring. It would have four non-equivalent aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring. It has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. This structure would produce exactly the observed NMR spectrum:\n            *   One singlet for the carboxylic acid proton (~11.0 ppm).\n            *   Two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group would be more deshielded (the 8.02 ppm peak), and the protons ortho to the -Cl group would be slightly less deshielded (the 7.72 ppm peak).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll three pieces of spectral data point unambiguously to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. It has the correct molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern (MS), the characteristic peaks for a carboxylic acid (IR), and the specific NMR pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid proton (¹H NMR).\n\n<<<B>>>"
