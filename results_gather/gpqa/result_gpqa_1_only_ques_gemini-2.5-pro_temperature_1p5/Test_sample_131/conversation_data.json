    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integral ratio. This indicates that each of the two compounds in the mixture has chemically equivalent aromatic protons, giving rise to a singlet. Since the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, the number of aromatic protons in each compound must be the same.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integral ratio. These signals must come from the methyl (or ethyl) groups of the two compounds combined.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of each possible compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Very high. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   C5 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   This gives **three singlets** with an integral ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C4 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This gives **two singlets** with an integral ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Very high.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups are not singlets. The -CH2- protons will be a quartet and the -CH3 protons will be a triplet. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets, so **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option C.\n\n**3. Evaluate the mixtures:**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets (1:1 ratio). All three tetramethylbenzene isomers give a 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture of any two will result in two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio (2H:2H). So, this information alone is not enough to distinguish between options A, B, and D.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets (2:1:1 ratio). Let's check the combinations.\n\nLet's assume there is no accidental overlap of signals from the different compounds.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5- gives one aliphatic singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5- gives three aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Total signals = 1 + 3 = 4 aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data (three signals).\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4- gives two aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   1,2,3,5- gives three aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Total signals = 2 + 3 = 5 aliphatic singlets (unless there is overlap). This does not match the data (three signals).\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5- gives **one** aliphatic singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4- gives **two** aliphatic singlets.\n    *   Total signals = 1 + 2 = **three** aliphatic singlets. This matches the number of signals observed.\n    *   Let's check the ratio. The signals correspond to:\n        *   One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        *   One 6H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene).\n        *   Another 6H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene).\n    *   The integral ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the aliphatic region data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that perfectly accounts for all the features of the given 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
