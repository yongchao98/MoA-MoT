    "To solve this problem, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex in solution.\n\n1.  **Write the chemical equation for the dissociation.**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$ (where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ion), dissociates into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($Y^{4-}$).\n    The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the given formation constant ($K_f$).**\n    The formation constant, $K_{Ca-EDTA}$ or $K_f$, is given for the formation reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    The phrase \"ideal pH\" implies that we can use this formation constant directly without needing to correct for the protonation of the free EDTA anion ($Y^{4-}$).\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We start with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n\n| Species         | $[CaY]^{2-}$ | $Ca^{2+}$ | $Y^{4-}$ |\n| :-------------- | :-----------: | :-------: | :------: |\n| **I**nitial (M) | 0.02         | 0         | 0        |\n| **C**hange (M)  | -x           | +x        | +x       |\n| **E**quilibrium(M)| 0.02 - x     | x         | x        |\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.**\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Solve for x.**\n    Since the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the complex is very stable, and very little of it will dissociate. This means that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    Now, the equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n\n    Now, take the square root to find x, which is the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{0.4 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
