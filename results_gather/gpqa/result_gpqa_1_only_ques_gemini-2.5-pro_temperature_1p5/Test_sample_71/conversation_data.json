    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product 4 and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (let's call it NBD-OtBu), 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Analysis of the diene precursor:** The reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Its molecular formula is C₈H₈Br₄. The reaction with sodium iodide, a reducing agent, especially at elevated temperatures, will cause a reductive elimination of the bromine atoms. The stoichiometry of the elimination is:\n    C₈H₈Br₄ + 4 NaI → C₈H₈ + 4 NaBr + 2 I₂\n*   **The generated diene (D):** The product of this elimination is a C₈H₈ species. The structure of the precursor strongly suggests that the product is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, a reactive isomer of o-xylylene. This molecule is a diene suitable for Diels-Alder reactions. The diene system is the `H₂C=C₅-C₆=CH₂` part.\n*   **The cycloaddition reaction:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (NBD-OtBu) has two equivalent double bonds and will act as a dienophile. It reacts with two equivalents of the generated diene (D) in a double Diels-Alder reaction.\n    NBD-OtBu + 2 D → Product 1\n    Each double bond of the NBD-OtBu reacts with one molecule of the diene D. Assuming the thermodynamically favored exo-addition on both sides, the resulting molecule (Product 1) will be highly symmetric, possessing C₂v symmetry. The structure consists of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton with the tert-butoxy group at C7, and two identical polycyclic groups (G) fused to the (C2, C3) and (C5, C6) positions.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether to an alcohol. The tert-butoxy group at C7 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group.\n    Product 1 (-O-tBu) → Product 2 (-OH) + isobutene\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method to oxidize a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The hydroxyl group at C7 is oxidized to a carbonyl group.\n    Product 2 (>CH-OH) → Product 3 (>C=O)\n    Product 3 retains the C₂v symmetry of Product 1. Its core is a 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (norbornan-7-one) skeleton.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated at 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** This step could potentially induce a retro-Diels-Alder reaction or other thermal rearrangements. A retro-Diels-Alder would sequentially eliminate the two diene molecules (D) to form 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which would then lose carbon monoxide (CO) to form benzene. Benzene has only one type of hydrogen, which is not an option. Alternatively, the 7-oxo-NBD intermediate has only two types of hydrogens, also not an option.\n*   Many complex Diels-Alder adducts are thermally stable at 150°C. A common pattern in such problems is to include a step that results in no reaction. Assuming the adduct is stable at this temperature, Product 4 is the same as Product 3.\n    Product 3 → (no reaction) → Product 4 (so, Product 4 = Product 3)\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (i.e., Product 3)**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Product 3 has C₂v symmetry. It has a C₂ axis passing through the C7=O group and two perpendicular mirror planes. One plane contains C1, C4, and C7=O.\n*   **Protons on the norbornane core:**\n    1.  The two bridgehead protons on C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  The four protons on the carbons where the fusion occurs (C2, C3, C5, C6) are all equivalent by the C₂v symmetry operations. This gives **1 signal**.\n    So, the core of the molecule contributes 2 signals.\n*   **Protons on the fused groups (G):**\n    1.  The two fused groups (G) are equivalent by symmetry. We only need to count the distinct protons on one group.\n    2.  The group G is the C₈H₈ moiety from the diene D. It is fused to the rigid norbornane skeleton at two adjacent carbons (e.g., C2 and C3).\n    3.  This fusion breaks all internal symmetry that the G group might have had on its own. The environment for each of the 8 protons within one G group becomes unique.\n    4.  Therefore, the 8 protons of one G group are all chemically distinct. This gives **8 signals**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Total signals = (signals from core) + (signals from one G group)\n    Total signals = 2 + 8 = 10\n\nThus, product 4 has 10 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
