    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the suitable reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a ketone (butan-2-one) into a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to the carbonyl group.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻), provided by NaCN, is a strong nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack forms an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   To form the final product, this alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n3.  **Determine reagent A:** Reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (H⁺). Looking at the options for A:\n    *   `NaHSO₃`: Sodium bisulfite is used for bisulfite addition reactions, not for catalyzing cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   `H₃O⁺`: Hydronium ion, which represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄). A strong acid is an excellent proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n    Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n2.  **Analyze the conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis is a robust reaction that requires harsh conditions, typically either strong acid or strong base, often with heating.\n3.  **Determine reagent B:** Reagent 'B' is the catalyst for this hydrolysis, which occurs in the presence of water (H₂O). Let's evaluate the options for B:\n    *   `CH₃COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. While technically acidic, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under standard lab conditions.\n    *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis using a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ in aqueous solution is a standard and effective method for converting nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction, reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options:\nA) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\nB) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\nC) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\nD) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\n\nThe correct combination is found in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
