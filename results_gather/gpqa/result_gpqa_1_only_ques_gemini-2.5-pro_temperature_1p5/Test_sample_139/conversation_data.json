    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances and Reactions:**\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The melting point of B ... is very close to 277 K.\" 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is an extremely strong hint that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 5:** \"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\" This means that heating the precipitate G produces D₂O. This is characteristic of heating a deuterated metal hydroxide (e.g., M(OD)n → MOx + D₂O) or a salt containing heavy water of crystallization (Salt·xD₂O → Salt + xD₂O). For this to happen, D₂O must be involved in the initial reaction.\n    *   **Connecting Clues:** Since D₂O is a key component, it's highly probable that **liquid Y is D₂O**. The problem states that substance X reacts violently with liquid Y.\n    *   **Clues 7 & 8:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" These clues point towards a reducing agent used in organic synthesis. Keto acids (R-CO-COOH) have two reducible groups: a ketone and a carboxylic acid. Strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) can reduce both, yielding a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ is a staple reagent, fitting the description. The mention of a \"heavier isotope\" (Clue 1) leads us to its deuterated analog: **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Confirming with all clues:** Let's test the hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n        *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑\n        *   **Clue 1 (Heavy Isotope):** X (LiAlD₄) contains Deuterium (D). ✓\n        *   **Clue 2 (Violent Reaction):** The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is notoriously violent; the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be similarly violent. ✓\n        *   **Clue 3 (Gas W):** The gas released is D₂ (Deuterium gas). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. The number of neutrons and protons is the same. ✓\n        *   **Clue 4 (Precipitate G):** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is formed, which is insoluble and precipitates from the solution. ✓\n        *   **Clue 5 & 6 (G and B):** When precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. The released substance B is D₂O, whose melting point is indeed ~277 K. ✓\n    *   All clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit. We should use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H, and Al is naturally ~100% ²⁷Al).\n    *   Mass of Deuterium (D) ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   Mass of Aluminum (Al) ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   There are **four** Deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   There is **one** Aluminum atom in LiAlD₄. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Total mass of D atoms) + (Total mass of Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35 amu.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
