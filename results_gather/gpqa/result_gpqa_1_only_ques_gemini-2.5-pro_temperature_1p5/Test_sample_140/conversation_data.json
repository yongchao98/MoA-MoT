    "This problem involves an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. The Reactant and Reagents**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2. The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base. The amide ion (NH2⁻) will act as the base in the elimination step and as the nucleophile in the addition step.\n\n**2. The Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Elimination to form a benzyne intermediate.**\n    The strong base (NH2⁻) abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. This is known as the kinetic isotope effect (KIE). Therefore, the abstraction of the proton from C6 will be faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2. However, both pathways are possible and will lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6):**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2):**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Stage 2: Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3).\n\n*   **Addition to 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. These two carbons are not equivalent because of the nearby deuterium at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either carbon.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** This forms a carbanion at C6. Protonation of C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** This forms a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    So, Pathway A leads to two different products.\n\n*   **Addition to Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2. These two carbons are equivalent in the symmetric benzyne molecule.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 (or C2):** This forms a carbanion at C2 (or C1). Protonation yields **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    So, Pathway B leads to one product.\n\n**4. Summary of Possible Products**\n\nCombining the outcomes from both possible pathways, we have three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
