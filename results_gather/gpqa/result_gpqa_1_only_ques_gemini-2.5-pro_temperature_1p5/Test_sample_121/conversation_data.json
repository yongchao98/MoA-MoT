    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. Although not the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) conditions (which use PBr3), this set of reagents achieves the same outcome. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid (likely by forming a mixed anhydride), making the α-protons more acidic and facilitating enolization. Bromine then reacts with the enol form. Pyridine acts as a base to catalyze the reaction and neutralize the HBr byproduct.\n*   The reaction is: CH3COOH + Br2 → BrCH2COOH + HBr\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4 (catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol under acidic catalysis to form an ester.\n*   The reaction is: BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide anion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide leaving group.\n*   The reaction is: BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess NaH (a strong base), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  The protons on the carbon between the cyano group and the ester group in ethyl cyanoacetate are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). NaH will deprotonate it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate:\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H2\n    2.  The phrase \"excess sodium hydride\" along with a dihaloalkane suggests that two equivalents of the enolate will react with one equivalent of the dihaloalkane. This is a common variation of the malonic ester synthesis used to link two fragments. An alternative intramolecular cyclization is plausible but leads to a product whose NMR signal count does not match the options provided. The dimerization reaction is chemically sound and leads to a matching answer.\n    3.  The reaction proceeds as:\n        2 [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → EtOOC(CN)CH-(CH2)5-CH(CN)COOEt + 2 NaBr\n*   **Product 4:** Diethyl 2,8-dicyanodecanedioate.\n    EtOOC-CH(CN)-(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-CH(CN)-COOEt\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 has two stereocenters (the two carbons bonded to both a CN and a COOEt group). The reaction will produce a mixture of a racemic pair ((R,R) and (S,S)) and a meso compound ((R,S)). Let's analyze the spectrum for the chiral racemic pair, which has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group (c). The two halves of the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Ethyl groups (-OCH2CH3):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   **-CH3 protons:** The two methyl groups are equivalent. All protons within them are equivalent due to rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2- protons:** The two methylene groups are equivalent. However, each is adjacent to a stereocenter. This makes the two protons on each methylene group diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent). This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n2.  **Methine protons (-CH(CN)):** The two methine protons are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Pentane bridge protons (-(CH2)5-):** We label the carbons from the methine outward: -(CH2)a-(CH2)b-(CH2)c-(CH2)b'-(CH2)a'-.\n    *   **-(CH2)a and -(CH2)a' protons:** These two groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons within each group are diastereotopic (due to proximity to the stereocenter). This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **-(CH2)b and -(CH2)b' protons:** These two groups are equivalent by symmetry. The geminal protons within each group are also diastereotopic. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **-(CH2)c proton:** This central methylene group is unique and lies on the C2 axis. Its two protons are diastereotopic (no local plane of symmetry bisecting the H-C-H angle). This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From ethyl groups: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals\n*   From methine protons: 1 signal\n*   From pentane bridge: 2 (for CH2a) + 2 (for CH2b) + 2 (for CH2c) = 6 signals\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 3 + 1 + 6 = **10**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
