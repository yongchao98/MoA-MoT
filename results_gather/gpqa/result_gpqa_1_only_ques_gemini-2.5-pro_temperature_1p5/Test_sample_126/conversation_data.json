    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Draw the structure of the starting molecule.**\n    The name is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   \"nona\" indicates a 9-carbon main chain.\n    *   \"-2,6-diene\" indicates double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   \"5-butyl\" indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) attached to carbon 5.\n\n    To get the lowest numbers for the double bonds (2 and 6), we number the chain from left to right:\n    CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)\n                                    |\n                                    CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ (butyl group)\n\n2.  **Identify the type of reaction.**\n    The starting molecule contains a 1,5-diene system. The double bonds are at C2=C3 and C6=C7, separated by single bonds from C4 and C5. The core reacting system is C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7. Heating a 1,5-diene typically induces a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope rearrangement mechanism.**\n    In a Cope rearrangement, the sigma bond between the two allylic fragments (the C3-C4 bond in the standard 1-to-6 numbering) breaks, a new sigma bond forms between the ends of the system (C1 and C6), and the π bonds shift.\n    In our molecule, using the IUPAC numbers:\n    *   The C4-C5 single bond breaks.\n    *   A new single bond forms between C2 and C7.\n    *   The double bond at C2=C3 shifts to C3=C4.\n    *   The double bond at C6=C7 shifts to C5=C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure of the product.**\n    Let's trace the connectivity of the carbon atoms in the product:\n    *   The original C1-C9 chain is broken between C4 and C5.\n    *   A new connection is made between C2 and C7.\n    *   Let's analyze the two fragments that are reconnected:\n        *   **Fragment 1 (derived from C1-C4):** The CH₃(C1) is attached to C2. C2 is attached to C3. C3 is now double-bonded to C4. This gives us a CH₃-CH-CH=CH₂ fragment, where the CH group is C2.\n        *   **Fragment 2 (derived from C5-C9 and the butyl group):** The butyl group is on C5. C5 is now double-bonded to C6. C6 is attached to C7. C7 has an ethyl group (C8-C9) attached. This gives a (Butyl)-C=CH-CH-(Ethyl) fragment, where the CH group is C7.\n    *   Now, we connect these two fragments by forming a bond between C2 and C7:\n        CH₃-CH(from C2) - CH(from C7)-(Ethyl)\n           |             |\n           CH=CH₂        CH=C-(Butyl)\n\n    Combining these gives the final structure:\n        CH₂(from C4)=CH(from C3) - CH(CH₃)(from C2) - CH(CH₂CH₃)(from C7) - CH(from C6)=C(from C5)-(Butyl)\n\n5.  **Name the product using IUPAC nomenclature.**\n    Let's write the structure out linearly and find the longest carbon chain that includes both double bonds.\n           CH₃     CH₂CH₃\n           |       |\n    CH₂=CH - CH - CH - CH = C - CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃\n\n    *   Number the chain starting from the end that gives the double bonds the lowest possible locants. We start from the CH₂= group on the left.\n           CH₃     CH₂CH₃\n           |       |\n    CH₂=CH - CH - CH - CH = C - CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃\n    1   2    3    4    5     6   7   8   9   10\n\n    *   **Longest chain:** The chain is 10 carbons long, so it is a \"deca-\" derivative.\n    *   **Functional group:** There are two double bonds, starting at C1 and C5. So, it is a \"deca-1,5-diene\".\n    *   **Substituents:** There is a methyl group (-CH₃) at C3 and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) at C4.\n    *   **Final name:** Alphabetizing the substituents, the name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    A) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    C) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    D) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n\n    Our derived name matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
