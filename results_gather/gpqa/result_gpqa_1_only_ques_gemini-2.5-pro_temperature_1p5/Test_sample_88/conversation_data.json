    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, heated to 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:** IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ and ¹H NMR spectrum with signals for 14 protons.\n*   **Analysis:** The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically a ketone in a strained ring system. The fact that there are 14 protons (the same as in the starting material's hydrocarbon framework) and one oxygen atom (from KOH) suggests that the product has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. This corresponds to a saturated tricyclic ketone (Degree of Unsaturation = 3 for the rings + 1 for the C=O = 4).\n*   The reaction involves a complex cage rearrangement under the harsh basic conditions. While the provided NMR data (especially the signal at 4.79 ppm) is unusual for simple adamantane derivatives, the combined evidence points to a rearranged saturated ketone. A known product from such reactions is **protoadamantan-4-one**. Let's assume this is Product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction appears to be a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. However, the next step involves ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond. This implies that the reaction conditions (heat and the Lewis-acidic Al(O-iPr)₃) cause both **reduction of the ketone to an alcohol** and subsequent **dehydration of the alcohol to form an alkene**.\n    *   **Step 2a (Reduction):** Protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol.\n    *   **Step 2b (Dehydration):** The alcohol protoadamantan-4-ol is dehydrated. Elimination will form the most stable alkene, which involves removing a proton from an adjacent carbon. This will preferably form the double bond in a non-bridgehead position.\n    *   **Product 2:** The likely product is **protoadamant-4-ene**, which has a double bond that can be cleaved by ozone.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\n    *   Cleavage of the C4=C5 double bond in protoadamant-4-ene breaks one of the rings in the tricyclic system, resulting in a bicyclic dicarbonyl compound.\n    *   **Product 3:** The structure formed is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-one-7-carbaldehyde**. This molecule contains both a ketone group and an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Identify the most deshielded hydrogen:** In Product 3, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) is by far the most deshielded proton (typically δ = 9-10 ppm). Aldehyde protons do not exchange with deuterated solvents under normal NMR conditions.\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern:** We need to find what this aldehyde proton is coupled to.\n    1.  The aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to carbon C7 of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework.\n    2.  C7 is a methine group, meaning it is a CH group. It is bonded to one proton (H7).\n    3.  The aldehyde proton will couple to the proton on C7 (H7) through three bonds (³J coupling). This coupling will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    4.  We must also consider long-range coupling. C7 is adjacent to two methylene (CH₂) groups: C6 and C8.\n    5.  In rigid cyclic systems, four-bond (⁴J) \"W-pathway\" coupling can be significant. It is plausible that the aldehyde proton couples to the two protons on one of the adjacent CH₂ groups (e.g., C6) but has negligible coupling to the other (e.g., C8) due to the specific conformation of the molecule.\n    6.  Coupling to the two equivalent protons of the C6 methylene group will split the signal into a **triplet**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The aldehyde proton signal is split into a doublet by the adjacent methine proton (H7) and is further split into a triplet by the two protons of an adjacent methylene group (C6H₂). Therefore, the overall coupling pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
