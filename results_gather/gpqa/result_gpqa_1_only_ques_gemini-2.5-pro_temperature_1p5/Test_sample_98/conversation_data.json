    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between the structures.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the specific splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the proton signals.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds, which is true for all four candidate structures.\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A set of two adjacent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   A set of three adjacent protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A set of two adjacent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two adjacent protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\nNow let's examine each structure to see if it would produce these signals. We number the carbons starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        CH₃   CH₃\n        |     |\n  CH₃-CH₂-CH-CH-COOH\n      5  4  3   2   1\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), and CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This proton would be a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and CH₃ on C2 (3H, quartet). This is a dq (doublet of quartets).\n*   This structure contains a **dtq** but has no proton that is coupled to two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a **dtt**.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        Et    Et\n        |     |\n  CH₃-CH₂-CH-CH-COOH\n      5  4  3   2   1\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This proton would be a **dtt**.\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This is a dt (doublet of triplets).\n*   This structure contains a **dtt** but not a **dtq**.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        CH₃   CH₃\n        |     |\n  CH₃-CH-CH-CH₂-COOH\n      5  4   3  2   1\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), CH₂ at C2 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This proton would be a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and two CH₃ groups (6H total). This would be a doublet of septets (dsept) or more complex if the methyls are non-equivalent.\n*   This structure contains a **dtq** but not a **dtt**.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet's parse this formula: CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH\n        Et    Et\n        |     |\n  CH₃-CH-CH-CH₂-COOH\n      5  4   3   2   1\nThis structure has protons that fit both descriptions perfectly.\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to three different neighbouring groups:\n    1.  The H at C3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    2.  The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    3.  The terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3H) → quartet (q)\n    Therefore, the proton at C4 would appear as a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is also coupled to three different neighbouring groups:\n    1.  The H at C4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n    2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    3.  The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H) → triplet (t)\n    Therefore, the proton at C3 would appear as a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** Structure C is the only compound that would exhibit both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
