    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the relativistic velocity addition/subtraction formula. The relative velocity of astronaut 2 with respect to astronaut 1 ($v_{21}$) is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = v_{21} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$ (velocity of the first astronaut, mass 2m)\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$ (velocity of the second astronaut, mass 3m)\n\nPlug these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = -\\frac{1}{7}c \\approx -0.1428c$\n\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**. The negative sign simply indicates the direction of the relative velocity (astronaut 2 appears to be moving backward from astronaut 1's perspective).\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)\n\nThe total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ moving at a velocity $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy $E_1$:\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.155$\n*   Energy $E_2$:\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}}mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3}mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c** and the total energy is **5.96 mc²**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
