    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    In a solution containing Co²⁺ and SCN⁻, a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The cobalt-containing species are:\n    *   Free Co²⁺(aq)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (monothiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (dithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (trithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (tetrathiocyanato)\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration, c(Co):**\n    The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is given by:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = 10⁻² M`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (β) to relate the concentrations:**\n    The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of [Co²⁺]:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation for c(Co):\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex:**\n    The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. This is also known as the mole fraction (α₂) of the species.\n    `%[Co(SCN)₂] = ([[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)) * 100%`\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n    `%[Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) ) * 100%`\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n    `%[Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100%`\n\n6.  **Calculate the value:**\n    The total cobalt concentration is `10⁻² M`, and the initial thiocyanate concentration is `0.1 M`. Since the ligand `[SCN⁻]` is in large excess compared to the metal ion `c(Co)` (0.1 M >> 0.01 M), we can assume the equilibrium concentration of free thiocyanate is approximately equal to its initial concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate each term in the denominator (let's call the sum `S`):\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    `S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The term in the numerator corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex:\n    `Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\n    Now, calculate the fraction:\n    `Fraction (α₂) = Numerator / S = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    Finally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n    `Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
