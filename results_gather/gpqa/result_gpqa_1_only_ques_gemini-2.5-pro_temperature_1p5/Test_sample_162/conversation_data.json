    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, that we want to dissolve.\n\n*   The mass of Fe(OH)₃ is 0.1 g.\n*   We need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃. Using the approximate atomic masses:\n    *   Fe ≈ 56 g/mol\n    *   O ≈ 16 g/mol\n    *   H ≈ 1 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass (M) of Fe(OH)₃ = 56 + 3 * (16 + 1) = 56 + 3 * 17 = 107 g/mol.\n    *(Using more precise masses like Fe=55.845, O=15.999, H=1.008 gives M = 106.866 g/mol, which yields very similar results).*\n*   Now, calculate the moles (n) of Fe(OH)₃:\n    *   n = mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 107 g/mol = 9.346 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**Step 2: Write the dissolution reaction and determine the moles of acid needed**\n\nFe(OH)₃ is a basic salt that dissolves in strong acid according to the following neutralization reaction:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of this reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n\n*   Moles of H⁺ required = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ = 3 * (9.346 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.804 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimum volume of the strong acid**\n\nThe question asks for the *minimum* volume of acid required, which corresponds to this stoichiometric amount. We are given a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid.\n\n*   Concentration (C) of acid = 0.1 M = 0.1 mol/L.\n*   Volume (V) = moles / Concentration = 2.804 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02804 L.\n*   To convert the volume to cm³, we multiply by 1000:\n    *   V = 0.02804 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.04 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (28.04 cm³) is extremely close to the value of 28.05 cm³ given in option D. This strongly suggests that option D is the correct choice.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution**\n\nWhen the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved, we have a solution containing Fe³⁺ ions. The Fe³⁺ ion is a weak acid and will hydrolyze in water, producing H⁺ ions and making the solution acidic.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\nFe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\nFirst, let's find the initial concentration of Fe³⁺. The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\n*   [Fe³⁺]initial = moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume = 9.346 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L = 0.009346 M.\n\nThe acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the Fe³⁺(aq) ion is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻³. We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentration of H⁺.\n\n|             | Fe³⁺      | [Fe(OH)]²⁺ | H⁺      |\n|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|\n| Initial (I) | 0.009346  | 0          | 0       |\n| Change (C)  | -x        | +x         | +x      |\n| Equil. (E)  | 0.009346-x| x          | x       |\n\nNow, we use the Ka expression:\nKa = [H⁺][[Fe(OH)]²⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = (x)(x) / (0.009346 - x) = 6.3 x 10⁻³\n\nThis gives the quadratic equation:\nx² + (6.3 x 10⁻³)x - 5.888 x 10⁻⁵ = 0\n\nSolving for x (which is [H⁺]) using the quadratic formula gives:\nx = [H⁺] ≈ 0.00515 M\n\nNow, calculate the pH:\npH = -log₁₀[H⁺] = -log₁₀(0.00515) ≈ 2.29\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOur calculations give:\n*   Volume = 28.04 cm³\n*   pH = 2.29\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nB) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nC) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nD) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n\nOur calculated volume (28.04 cm³) matches the volume in option D almost perfectly. Although our calculated pH (2.29) does not exactly match the pH in option D (2.04), the discrepancy is likely due to simplified assumptions or different constants used in the problem's source. Given that the volume calculation is based on fundamental stoichiometry and is a very close match, option D is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
