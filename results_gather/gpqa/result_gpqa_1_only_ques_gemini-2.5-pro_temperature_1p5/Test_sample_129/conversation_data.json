    "Here is a step-by-step estimation to determine the lower limit on the redshift:\n\n1.  **Identify the Rest Wavelength:** The absorption occurs at the Lyman-alpha ($\\text{Ly}\\alpha$) wavelength of neutral hydrogen, which is $\\lambda_0 = 1216 \\text{ Å}$ (Angstroms). This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Consider the Constraint:** Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation, primarily due to absorption by the ozone layer. The atmospheric \"optical window\" begins at a wavelength of approximately 3500-3600 Å (or 350-360 nm). Light with wavelengths shorter than this is blocked and cannot reach a telescope on the ground.\n\n3.  **Apply the Redshift Concept:** For the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be detectable from the ground, its rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) must be stretched by the expansion of the universe (redshifted) to an observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) that is inside the optical window. Therefore, the observed wavelength must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff.\n    $\\lambda_{obs} > \\lambda_{cutoff}$\n\n    To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we set the observed wavelength equal to the cutoff wavelength:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx 3500 \\text{ Å}$\n\n4.  **Use the Redshift Formula:** The relationship between rest wavelength, observed wavelength, and redshift ($z$) is given by:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_0 (1+z)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Redshift:** We can now solve for the redshift, $z$.\n    $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_0} - 1$\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $z = \\frac{3500 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}} - 1$\n    $z \\approx 2.88 - 1$\n    $z \\approx 1.88$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated lower limit for the redshift is approximately 1.88. This value is very close to option D.\n\nLet's check the observed wavelength for each option:\nA) z = 1.2 -> $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1+1.2) = 2675 \\text{ Å}$ (Still in the UV, blocked by the atmosphere)\nB) z = 3 -> $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1+3) = 4864 \\text{ Å}$ (Blue-green light, easily detectable, but not the lower limit)\nC) z = 2.4 -> $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1+2.4) = 4134 \\text{ Å}$ (Violet light, detectable, but not the lower limit)\nD) z = 1.9 -> $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1+1.9) = 3526 \\text{ Å}$ (This is right at the edge of the atmospheric window, making it the most plausible lower limit for detection)\n\nTherefore, a redshift of at least ~1.9 is required.\n\n<<<D>>>"
