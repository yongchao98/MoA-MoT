This method simplifies the problem by replacing the conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge that replicates the electric field outside the sphere.\n\n### The Method of Images\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge *q* at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* (where *d* > *R*), the effect of the induced charges on the sphere's surface can be modeled by a single image charge, *q'*. This image charge is located inside the sphere along the line connecting the center and the charge *q*.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is: *q'* = -(*R*/*d*) *q*.\n    *   The position of the image charge from the center is: *d'* = *R*²/*d*.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from an infinite distance to the distance *d* from the sphere's center. This work is done against the attractive force exerted by the induced surface charge, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge *q'*.\n\n    The potential energy (U) of the charge *q* due to the potential created by the image charge *q'* is given by half of the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. The factor of 1/2 arises because as the charge *q* is moved, the induced charge distribution on the sphere continuously readjusts, and the work done to create this induced distribution is equal to the work done to move the charge *q* in the field of the induced charges.\n\n    The potential (V') created by the image charge *q'* at the location of the real charge *q* is:\n    V' = k * q' / (d - d')\n    where k is Coulomb's constant (1/4πε₀).\n\n    Substituting the values for *q'* and *d'*:\n    V' = k * [-(*R*/*d*) *q*] / (*d* - *R*²/*d*)\n    V' = -k * (*R*/*d*) *q* / [(*d*² - *R*²)/ *d*]\n    V' = -k * *q* *R* / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\n    The potential energy of the system is then:\n    U = (1/2) * q * V'\n    U = (1/2) * q * [-k * *q* *R* / (*d*² - *R*²)]\n    U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (*d*² - *R*²)\nB) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * d / (*d*² + *R*²)\nC) U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R² / (*d*² - *R*²)\nD) U = - k * q² * d / (*d*² - *R*²)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the net potential energy of a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the method of images is employed.\n\nIn this method, the grounded conducting sphere is replaced by an \"image charge\" that, along with the original charge `q`, reproduces the zero potential on the spherical surface.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and its Location**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, the image charge `q'` is located along the same line at a distance `b` from the center.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -qR/d`.\n    *   Its position is `b = R²/d`.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is equal to the potential energy of the interaction between the charge `q` and the fields created by the induced charges on the sphere. In the image method, this is equivalent to the interaction between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    However, a crucial point is that the potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy of the real charge with the image charge. This factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge on the sphere is not a fixed entity; it is created and maintained by the presence of the charge `q`.\n\n    The interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is calculated as:\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'` = `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   Interaction Energy `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance) = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`.\n    *   `U_interaction = -k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`.\n\n    The net potential energy of the system is half of this value:\n    *   `U_system = (1/2) * U_interaction = (1/2) * [-k * q² * R / (d² - R²)]`.\n    *   `U_system = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere, due to the point charge `q`, are identical to the field and potential produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere, with the sphere itself removed.\n\n**1. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from its center (`d > R`), the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center along the same line as `q`) are chosen to make the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) equal to zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, and the real charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nA common mistake is to calculate the potential energy of the two-charge system (`q` and `q'`) directly as `U = kqq' / (d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the position of the real charge `q`.\n\nThe correct way to calculate the energy is to use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n\n*   The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n*   So, `V_induced` is the potential at `d` due to `q'` at `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n**Alternative Method (Work Integral):**\nThe potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. The force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the image charge:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\nThe potential energy is the integral of the external force (`-F(x)`) from infinity to `d`:\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) -F(x) dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\nUsing the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, the integral evaluates to:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe correct answer is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and the Method of Images**\n\n*   **System:** We have a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Condition:** The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n*   **Method:** This is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the \"method of images.\" The effect of the grounded sphere on the external charge `q` can be perfectly replicated by removing the sphere and placing an \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the original sphere's volume. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center, along the same line as `d`) are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The image charge is located inside the sphere (`b < R` since `d > R`) and has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`. This ensures an attractive force.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`, while the sphere remains grounded. There are two common ways to calculate this.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force (Work Done)**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against the electric force from the sphere.\n`U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n\n*   **Force `F(x)`:** The force on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n    *   `q'(x) = -q * (R / x)`\n    *   `b(x) = R^2 / x`\n    *   Distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R/x * 1/((x^2-R^2)/x)^2`\n    *   `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R/x * x^2/(x^2-R^2)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n*   **Integration:** Now we integrate to find the work.\n    *   `U = - ∫[∞, d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n    *   Using substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`. The integral becomes `∫(1/u^2) (du/2) = -1/(2u)`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    *   The term with infinity goes to zero.\n    *   `U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2)) = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   **`V_induced`:** This is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all *other* charges, which in this case are the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   **Careful Point:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charges (and the potential they create) are themselves proportional to `q`. The energy is not simply `qV` as it would be for a test charge in a fixed external potential.\n*   **Calculation:** The potential from the induced charges at distance `d` is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'` at that point.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    *   Distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   **Final Energy:** Substitute this potential back into the energy formula.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Answer Analysis**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, has `R^2` instead of `R`.\nB) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R`.\nC) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This matches our result.**\nD) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect numerator and denominator.\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is negative, which makes physical sense because the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive. Work is done by the field as the charge is brought from infinity, so the potential energy of the system decreases from its zero reference at infinity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at an electric potential of zero (V = 0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce charges to redistribute on the surface of the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere are the result of both the original charge `q` and this induced surface charge.\n\nThe \"method of images\" is a powerful technique to solve this problem. It allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location (`b`) inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as the original charge. The values are given by:\n\n*   **Location of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe system of the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: the real charge `q` at `d` and the image charge `q'` at `b`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` moves, the induced charge on the sphere (and thus the image charge `q'`) continuously changes. Therefore, we must integrate the force on the charge `q` as it is brought in from infinity.\n\nLet the charge `q` be at a variable position `x` from the center of the sphere (`x` goes from `∞` to `d`).\n\n1.  **Force on the charge `q` at position `x`:**\n    The force on the real charge `q` is due to the attraction from the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n    At position `x`, the image charge has a magnitude `q'(x) = -qR/x` and is located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    The distance between the real charge `q` at `x` and the image charge `q'` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    The force `F(x)` on the charge `q` is:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2)`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive.\n\n2.  **Work Done (Potential Energy):**\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n    `U = W_ext = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n3.  **Solving the Integral:**\n    We can solve this integral using a u-substitution.\n    Let `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du / 2`.\n    The limits of integration also change:\n    *   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n    *   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n\n    Now substitute into the integral:\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] u^-2 du`\n    The integral of `u^-2` is `-u^-1`.\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ (lim u→∞ 1/u) - (1 / (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ 0 - 1 / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   B) `U = - k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   C) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n*   D) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived expression matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nI have analyzed the problem using the method of images, which is the standard approach for this type of electrostatics problem.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Use the method of images to find the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` that correctly models the grounded conducting sphere.\n2.  Calculate the potential energy of the system. The potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`.

The charge is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center. We can determine the correct expression by applying a series of physical constraints.\n\n**1. Dimensional Analysis**\nThe potential energy `U` must have the dimensions of energy. In electrostatics, energy is proportional to `k * q^2 / distance`. Therefore, the correct expression must have dimensions of `[k][q]²/[L]`.\n*   **A) `k*q²*R/(d²-R²)`:** `[k*q²/L]`. Correct.\n*   **B) `k*q²*d/(d²+R²)`:** `[k*q²/L]`.

Boundary Condition: Charge Approaching the Sphere (d → R⁺)**\nAs the charge `q` gets infinitesimally close to the surface of the conducting sphere, the attractive force between the charge and the induced surface charge becomes infinitely large. Consequently, the potential energy of the system must approach negative infinity (`-∞`).\n*   **A) `U = - (1/2) * kq² * R / (d² - R²)`:** As `d → R⁺`, the denominator `(d² - R²) → 0⁺`, so `U → -∞`. Correct.\n*   **B) `U = - (1/2) * kq² * d / (d² + R²)`:** As `d → R⁺`, the denominator `(d² + R²) → 2R²`, so `U` approaches a finite value `-kq²/(4R)`. Incorrect.\n*   **D) `U = - kq² * d / (d² - R²)`:** As `d → R⁺`, the denominator `(d² - R²) → 0⁺`, so `U → -∞`. Correct.\n\nThis constraint eliminates option B.\n\n**3. Asymptotic Behavior: Charge Far from the Sphere (d → ∞)**\nWhen the charge `q` is very far from the sphere, the sphere behaves like an induced electric dipole. The potential energy of a point charge interacting with an induced dipole falls off with distance as `1/d²`.\n*   **A) `U = - (1/2) * kq² * R / (d² - R²)`:** For large `d`, `d² - R² ≈ d²`. Thus, `U ≈ - (1/2) * kq² * R / d²`. The energy falls off as `1/d²`. Correct.\n*   **D) `U = - kq² * d / (d² - R²)`:** For large `d`, `d² - R² ≈ d²`. Thus, `U ≈ - kq² * d / d² = -kq²/d`. The energy falls off as `1/d`. Incorrect.\n\nThis final constraint eliminates option D.\n\nOnly option A satisfies all three physical constraints.

Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nA common mistake is to calculate the potential energy of the two-charge system (`q` and `q'`) directly as `U = kqq' / (d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the position of the real charge `q`.\n\nThe correct way to calculate the energy is to use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n\n*   The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n*   So, `V_induced` is the potential at `d` due to `q'` at `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n**Alternative Method (Work Integral):**\nThe potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. The force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the image charge:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\nThe potential energy is the integral of the external force (`-F(x)`) from infinity to `d`:\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) -F(x) dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\nUsing the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, the integral evaluates to:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe correct answer is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and the Method of Images**\n\n*   **System:** We have a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Condition:** The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n*   **Method:** This is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the \"method of images.\" The effect of the grounded sphere on the external charge `q` can be perfectly replicated by removing the sphere and placing an \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the original sphere's volume. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center, along the same line as `d`) are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The image charge is located inside the sphere (`b < R` since `d > R`) and has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`. This ensures an attractive force.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`, while the sphere remains grounded. There are two common ways to calculate this.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force (Work Done)**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against the electric force from the sphere.\n`U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n\n*   **Force `F(x)`:** The force on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n    *   `q'(x) = -q * (R / x)`\n    *   `b(x) = R^2 / x`\n    *   Distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R/x * 1/((x^2-R^2)/x)^2`\n    *   `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R/x * x^2/(x^2-R^2)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n*   **Integration:** Now we integrate to find the work.\n    *   `U = - ∫[∞, d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n    *   Using substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`. The integral becomes `∫(1/u^2) (du/2) = -1/(2u)`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    *   The term with infinity goes to zero.\n    *   `U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2)) = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   **`V_induced`:** This is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all *other* charges, which in this case are the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   **Careful Point:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charges (and the potential they create) are themselves proportional to `q`. The energy is not simply `qV` as it would be for a test charge in a fixed external potential.\n*   **Calculation:** The potential from the induced charges at distance `d` is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'` at that point.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    *   Distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   **Final Energy:** Substitute this potential back into the energy formula.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Answer Analysis**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, has `R^2` instead of `R`.\nB) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R`.\nC) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This matches our result.**\nD) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect numerator and denominator.\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is negative, which makes physical sense because the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive. Work is done by the field as the charge is brought from infinity, so the potential energy of the system decreases from its zero reference at infinity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at an electric potential of zero (V = 0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` will induce charges to redistribute on the surface of the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere are the result of both the original charge `q` and this induced surface charge.\n\nThe \"method of images\" is a powerful technique to solve this problem. It allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location (`b`) inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as the original charge. The values are given by:\n\n*   **Location of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe system of the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: the real charge `q` at `d` and the image charge `q'` at `b`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` moves, the induced charge on the sphere (and thus the image charge `q'`) continuously changes. Therefore, we must integrate the force on the charge `q` as it is brought in from infinity.\n\nLet the charge `q` be at a variable position `x` from the center of the sphere (`x` goes from `∞` to `d`).\n\n1.  **Force on the charge `q` at position `x`:**\n    The force on the real charge `q` is due to the attraction from the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n    At position `x`, the image charge has a magnitude `q'(x) = -qR/x` and is located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    The distance between the real charge `q` at `x` and the image charge `q'` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    The force `F(x)` on the charge `q` is:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2)`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive.\n\n2.  **Work Done (Potential Energy):**\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n    `U = W_ext = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from d to ∞] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n3.  **Solving the Integral:**\n    We can solve this integral using a u-substitution.\n    Let `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du / 2`.\n    The limits of integration also change:\n    *   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n    *   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n\n    Now substitute into the integral:\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * ∫[from d^2-R^2 to ∞] u^-2 du`\n    The integral of `u^-2` is `-u^-1`.\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1/u] |_[from d^2-R^2 to ∞]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ (lim u→∞ 1/u) - (1 / (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ 0 - 1 / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   B) `U = - k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   C) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n*   D) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived expression matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nI have analyzed the problem using the method of images, which is the standard approach for this type of electrostatics problem.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.

Correct.\n*   **B) `U = - (1/2) * kq² * d / (d² + R²)`:** As `d → R⁺`, the denominator `(d² + R²) → 2R²`, so `U` approaches a finite value `-kq²/(4R)`. Incorrect.\n*   **D) `U = - kq² * d / (d² - R²)`:** As `d → R⁺`, the denominator `(d² - R²) → 0⁺`, so `U → -∞`. Correct.\n\nThis constraint eliminates option B.\n\n**3. Asymptotic Behavior: Charge Far from the Sphere (d → ∞)**\nWhen the charge `q` is very far from the sphere, the sphere behaves like an induced electric dipole. The potential energy of a point charge interacting with an induced dipole falls off with distance as `1/d²`.\n*   **A) `U = - (1/2) * kq² * R / (d² - R²)`:** For large `d`, `d² - R² ≈ d²`. Thus, `U ≈ - (1/2) * kq² * R / d²`. The energy falls off as `1/d²`. Correct.\n*   **D) `U = - kq² * d / (d² - R²)`:** For large `d`, `d² - R² ≈ d²`. Thus, `U ≈ - kq² * d / d² = -kq²/d`. The energy falls off as `1/d`. Incorrect.\n\nThis final constraint eliminates option D.\n\nOnly option A satisfies all three physical constraints. This result is also confirmed by the method of images, which is the standard technique for solving this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe problem is solved using the method of images. For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), the electrostatic effect outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'`.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**:\n    *   The image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**:\n    The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. The potential energy `U` of the charge `q` in the field of the induced charges (which is equivalent to the field of the image charge `q'`) is given by:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    Where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (distance `d` from the center) created by the image charge `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge distribution is not fixed but is created by the presence of `q`.\n\n    The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    The potential `V_induced` at position `d` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_induced = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Now, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    This expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",
