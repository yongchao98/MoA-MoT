Initial State and Energy\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The term \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest energy. Therefore, the total initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV. An antiproton has the exact same mass and therefore the same rest energy.\n\n*   Initial Energy ($E_i$) = Rest Energy of Proton + Rest Energy of Antiproton\n*   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n*   $E_i \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} + 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\nSince the initial particles are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n### 2. Final State and Energy\nThe annihilation results in four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. To conserve momentum, these four particles must move off in such a way that their total vector momentum is zero. By symmetry, they will all have the same magnitude of velocity, *v*.\n\nThe total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy equation:\n*   $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n*   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nGiven that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$:\n*   $E_f = 4 \\gamma (300 \\, \\text{MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### 3. Conservation of Energy\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the initial energy must equal the final energy:\n*   $E_i = E_f$\n*   $1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Velocity\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNext, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to solve for the velocity, *v*:\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n*   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2}$\n*   $1 - v^2/c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   $\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n*   $v = c \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n*   $v \\approx 0.7688 c$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.77c.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.96c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Process and Conservation Laws\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$). In particle physics, such processes are governed by the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation (including rest mass energy and kinetic energy) must equal the total energy of the products after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Initial Energy\n\nThe initial system consists of a proton and an antiproton. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. For the total momentum of the initial system to be zero (a common assumption in such problems, treating it in the center-of-mass frame), the proton would also be nearly at rest. Therefore, the initial energy is dominated by the rest mass energy of the two particles.\n\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n*   An antiparticle has the same mass as its corresponding particle, so the antiproton's rest mass energy ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938.3 MeV.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of their rest mass energies:\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 3. Set Up the Final Energy Equation\n\nThe final state consists of four particles of type A (two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$), each with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Since these particles are the result of the annihilation, they will be moving at high velocity.\n\nThe total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nSince there are four such particles and energy is conserved, the total final energy ($E_f$) is:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find γ\n\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\nNow, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n### 5. Calculate the Velocity\n\nThe final step is to calculate the velocity ($v$) from the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n\nThe formula for $\\gamma$ is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe rearrange this to solve for $v/c$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we found:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light (c).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving\". In particle physics, this is a common way to state that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Therefore, we can approximate the annihilation as occurring with the proton and antiproton at rest.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\nThe antiproton has the same mass as the proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis total initial energy must be conserved and will be converted into the total energy of the final particles.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State**\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. We are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are likely antiparticles, they have the same mass.\n\nThe total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total energies of these four particles.\n$E_{final} = E_{A_1^+} + E_{A_2^+} + E_{A_1^-} + E_{A_2^-}$\n\nSince the initial system was at rest (total momentum is zero), the total momentum of the final four particles must also be zero due to the conservation of momentum. The problem asks for \"the velocity of particle A\", implying that all four final particles have the same speed and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n\nTherefore, $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n**3. Equate Initial and Final Energy**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\nNow, we can solve for the total energy of a single particle A:\n$E_A = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity**\n\nWe now know the total energy ($E_A$) and the rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) for one of the A particles. We can use the relativistic energy formula to find its velocity.\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.563$\n\nNow, we can solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4093}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5907} \\approx 0.7686$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). This process converts the mass of the initial particles into the mass and kinetic energy of the final particles. The reaction is:\n    $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton.\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key piece of information. In particle physics problems, this phrase usually implies that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can assume the proton is at rest (as in a fixed-target experiment) and the antiproton's velocity is close to zero.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is approximately zero ($\\vec{P}_{initial} \\approx 0$). This is the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   We are given that the mass of each of these particles is the same: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The total energy from the annihilation is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of these four particles.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$, and $v_A$ is the velocity of particle A.\n    *   Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero to conserve momentum. The simplest and most symmetric way for this to happen is for the energy to be distributed equally among the four final particles. This means they all will have the same speed, $v_A$.\n    *   Therefore, the total final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma_A (m_A c^2)$\n    Substituting the given value for $m_A c^2$:\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma_A (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma_A$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Velocity ($v_A$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   We need to solve this equation for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma_A$ we found:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Initial State Approximation:** The interpretation of \"slowly moving\" is key. Assuming it means the initial kinetic energy is negligible simplifies the problem to an annihilation from rest, making the initial momentum zero and the initial energy purely rest mass energy.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The fundamental principles applied are the conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particles produced are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$) must be used.\n*   **Symmetry:** The problem asks for \"the velocity\", implying a single speed for all final particles. This is justified by the symmetry of the initial state (zero momentum) and the fact that all final particles have the same mass.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  Initial Energy: $E_{in} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n2.

The slight discrepancy in the fourth decimal place of the velocity calculation was due to a minor difference in the value used for the proton's rest mass energy, but the overall logic and the final result were validated. The problem is solved.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):** The system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which we interpret as having negligible kinetic energy. In the center-of-mass frame, both particles have negligible kinetic energy.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to determine the velocity of particle A.\n\n### 1. Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this annihilation process is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation. The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume the annihilation happens with the proton and antiproton effectively at rest.\n\n### 2. Initial Energy\n\nThe initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton ($p$) and the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   An antiparticle has the same mass as its corresponding particle, so the rest energy of the antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the total initial energy is:\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 3. Final Energy\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   The rest energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Since these particles are the result of an annihilation from a state of rest, they will be moving at high velocity. Their total energy is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy.\n\nThe total energy for a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\nSince the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. This implies that the energy is distributed equally among the four resulting particles. Thus, the total final energy ($E_{final}$) is:\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n\n### 4.

The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which we can approximate as being at rest, along with the proton. Therefore, the initial energy is purely the rest mass energy of the two particles.

Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the total energy will be distributed equally among the four product particles. This means they will all have the same speed, $v$, and thus the same Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Solve for Velocity:**\n    First, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.564$\n\n    Next, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$.

Conservation of Energy\n\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilating each other. The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest before annihilation.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, $E = mc^2$.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. The CODATA value provides a more precise figure of 938.272 MeV. Since a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, the antiproton also has a rest mass energy of 938.272 MeV.\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{proton} + E_{antiproton}$\n$E_{initial} = 938.272 \\text{ MeV} + 938.272 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.544 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis initial energy is conserved and converted into the four resulting particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$).\n\n### 2. Energy of the Final Particles\n\nThe final state consists of four particles of type A, each with a rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) of 300 MeV. The total initial energy is distributed equally among these four particles.\n\nThe total energy of a single moving particle A ($E_A$) is given by the relativistic energy equation:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWhere $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total final energy ($E_{final}$) is:\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n$1876.544 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$1876.544 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.544}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Velocity (v)\n\nThe final step is to calculate the velocity (v) from the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n\nStarting with the definition of $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe rearrange the formula to solve for $v/c$ (often denoted as $\\beta$):\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe analysis is complete.

To solve this, I will use the principle of conservation of energy. The initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton, assuming their kinetic energies are negligible. This total initial energy is converted into the total energy (rest mass energy plus kinetic energy) of the four resulting A particles. By equating the initial and final energies, I can solve for the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) of the A particles, and from that, their velocity. The first step is to find the rest mass of a proton.\n\n**Skeptic:** This approach is logical. However, we must be careful with the initial assumptions. The term \"slowly moving\" for the antiproton implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy, which is a safe assumption. The problem doesn't specify the proton's state, but in such problems, it's standard to assume a stationary target or a center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. Assuming both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest simplifies the initial energy calculation to the sum of their rest masses. The final state is symmetric, with four particles of equal mass, so by conservation of energy and momentum, they must all have the same speed. The plan to find the proton's rest mass energy is the correct next step.\n\n**Decision:** I will search for the rest mass energy of a proton in units of MeV.\n**Proposer:** The search results confirm that the rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. The CODATA value is more precise, 938.272 MeV, but 938 MeV is sufficient for this problem. An antiproton has the same rest mass. Now I have all the necessary values to apply the conservation of energy principle.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n1.  **Initial Energy ($E_i$):**\n    *   $E_i = (\\text{rest mass energy of proton}) + (\\text{rest mass energy of antiproton})$\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Final Energy ($E_f$):**\n    *   The final state has four particles ($2A^+$, $2A^-$), each with rest mass energy $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The total energy of the four particles is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    *   $1876 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n4.  **Solve for Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   $\\gamma = 1876 / 1200 \\approx 1.5633$\n\n5.  **Solve for velocity (v):**\n    *   $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - (v/c)^2)$\n    *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 / \\gamma^2$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - (1 / \\gamma^2) = 1 - (1 / 1.5633^2) = 1 - (1 / 2.444) = 1 - 0.409$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 0.591$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$. This matches option A.\n\n**Skeptic:** The calculation seems correct and follows the established physical principles. The values used are standard. The result $v \\approx 0.77c$ is a direct consequence of the calculation. There are no apparent failure modes in the logic. The answer seems robust.\n\n**Decision:** The debate has converged. The calculation is straightforward and the result matches one of the options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Understand the Process and Conservation Laws\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$). In particle physics, such processes are governed by the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation (including rest mass energy and kinetic energy) must equal the total energy of the products after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Initial Energy\n\nThe initial system consists of a proton and an antiproton. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. For the total momentum of the initial system to be zero (a common assumption in such problems, treating it in the center-of-mass frame), the proton would also be nearly at rest. Therefore, the initial energy is dominated by the rest mass energy of the two particles.\n\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n*   An antiparticle has the same mass as its corresponding particle, so the antiproton's rest mass energy ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938.3 MeV.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of their rest mass energies:\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 3. Set Up the Final Energy Equation\n\nThe final state consists of four particles of type A (two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$), each with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Since these particles are the result of the annihilation, they will be moving at high velocity.\n\nThe total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nSince there are four such particles and energy is conserved, the total final energy ($E_f$) is:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find γ\n\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\nNow, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n### 5. Calculate the Velocity\n\nThe final step is to calculate the velocity ($v$) from the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n\nThe formula for $\\gamma$ is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe rearrange this to solve for $v/c$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we found:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light (c).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving\". In particle physics, this is a common way to state that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Therefore, we can approximate the annihilation as occurring with the proton and antiproton at rest.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\nThe antiproton has the same mass as the proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis total initial energy must be conserved and will be converted into the total energy of the final particles.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State**\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. We are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are likely antiparticles, they have the same mass.\n\nThe total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total energies of these four particles.\n$E_{final} = E_{A_1^+} + E_{A_2^+} + E_{A_1^-} + E_{A_2^-}$\n\nSince the initial system was at rest (total momentum is zero), the total momentum of the final four particles must also be zero due to the conservation of momentum. The problem asks for \"the velocity of particle A\", implying that all four final particles have the same speed and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n\nTherefore, $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n**3. Equate Initial and Final Energy**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\nNow, we can solve for the total energy of a single particle A:\n$E_A = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity**\n\nWe now know the total energy ($E_A$) and the rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) for one of the A particles. We can use the relativistic energy formula to find its velocity.\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.563$\n\nNow, we can solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4093}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5907} \\approx 0.7686$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). This process converts the mass of the initial particles into the mass and kinetic energy of the final particles. The reaction is:\n    $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton.\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key piece of information. In particle physics problems, this phrase usually implies that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can assume the proton is at rest (as in a fixed-target experiment) and the antiproton's velocity is close to zero.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is approximately zero ($\\vec{P}_{initial} \\approx 0$). This is the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   We are given that the mass of each of these particles is the same: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The total energy from the annihilation is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of these four particles.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$, and $v_A$ is the velocity of particle A.\n    *   Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero to conserve momentum. The simplest and most symmetric way for this to happen is for the energy to be distributed equally among the four final particles. This means they all will have the same speed, $v_A$.\n    *   Therefore, the total final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma_A (m_A c^2)$\n    Substituting the given value for $m_A c^2$:\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma_A (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma_A$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Velocity ($v_A$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   We need to solve this equation for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma_A$ we found:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Initial State Approximation:** The interpretation of \"slowly moving\" is key. Assuming it means the initial kinetic energy is negligible simplifies the problem to an annihilation from rest, making the initial momentum zero and the initial energy purely rest mass energy.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The fundamental principles applied are the conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particles produced are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$) must be used.\n*   **Symmetry:** The problem asks for \"the velocity\", implying a single speed for all final particles. This is justified by the symmetry of the initial state (zero momentum) and the fact that all final particles have the same mass.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.

Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this annihilation process is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation. The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume the annihilation happens with the proton and antiproton effectively at rest.\n\n### 2.

The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which we can approximate as being at rest, along with the proton. Therefore, the initial energy is purely the rest mass energy of the two particles. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    The final state consists of four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$), all with the same mass $m_A$. Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the total energy will be distributed equally among the four product particles. This means they will all have the same speed, $v$, and thus the same Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Solve for Velocity:**\n    First, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.564$\n\n    Next, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    Rearranging to solve for $\\beta$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.769$\n\n    Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to determine the velocity of particle A.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilating each other. The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest before annihilation.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, $E = mc^2$.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. The CODATA value provides a more precise figure of 938.272 MeV. Since a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, the antiproton also has a rest mass energy of 938.272 MeV.\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{proton} + E_{antiproton}$\n$E_{initial} = 938.272 \\text{ MeV} + 938.272 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.544 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis initial energy is conserved and converted into the four resulting particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$).\n\n### 2. Energy of the Final Particles\n\nThe final state consists of four particles of type A, each with a rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) of 300 MeV. The total initial energy is distributed equally among these four particles.\n\nThe total energy of a single moving particle A ($E_A$) is given by the relativistic energy equation:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWhere $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total final energy ($E_{final}$) is:\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n$1876.544 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$1876.544 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.544}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Velocity (v)\n\nThe final step is to calculate the velocity (v) from the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n\nStarting with the definition of $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe rearrange the formula to solve for $v/c$ (often denoted as $\\beta$):\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe analysis is complete. The problem was modeled using the principle of conservation of energy. The initial energy of the system (the rest energy of a proton and an antiproton) was calculated to be approximately 1876.5 MeV.\n\nThe search space consisted of the four provided velocity options. Each option was used to calculate the total final energy of the four resulting 'A' particles.\n\nThe pruning step involved checking which candidate's final energy matched the initial energy.\n\n*   **Candidate A (0.91c):** Resulted in a final energy of ~2894 MeV. (FAIL)\n*   **Candidate B (0.96c):** Resulted in a final energy of ~4286 MeV. (FAIL)\n*   **Candidate C (0.77c):** Resulted in a final energy of ~1881 MeV. This is a very close match to the initial energy of 1876.5 MeV, with the small difference attributable to rounding in the option value. (PASS)\n*   **Candidate D (0.86c):** Resulted in a final energy of ~2352 MeV. (FAIL)\n\nOnly one candidate satisfied the energy conservation constraint.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Proposer:** The problem involves the annihilation of a proton and a slowly moving antiproton, resulting in four particles of type A. To solve this, I will use the principle of conservation of energy. The initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton, assuming their kinetic energies are negligible. This total initial energy is converted into the total energy (rest mass energy plus kinetic energy) of the four resulting A particles. By equating the initial and final energies, I can solve for the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) of the A particles, and from that, their velocity. The first step is to find the rest mass of a proton.\n\n**Skeptic:** This approach is logical. However, we must be careful with the initial assumptions. The term \"slowly moving\" for the antiproton implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy, which is a safe assumption. The problem doesn't specify the proton's state, but in such problems, it's standard to assume a stationary target or a center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. Assuming both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest simplifies the initial energy calculation to the sum of their rest masses. The final state is symmetric, with four particles of equal mass, so by conservation of energy and momentum, they must all have the same speed. The plan to find the proton's rest mass energy is the correct next step.\n\n**Decision:** I will search for the rest mass energy of a proton in units of MeV.\n**Proposer:** The search results confirm that the rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. The CODATA value is more precise, 938.272 MeV, but 938 MeV is sufficient for this problem. An antiproton has the same rest mass. Now I have all the necessary values to apply the conservation of energy principle.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n1.  **Initial Energy ($E_i$):**\n    *   $E_i = (\\text{rest mass energy of proton}) + (\\text{rest mass energy of antiproton})$\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Final Energy ($E_f$):**\n    *   The final state has four particles ($2A^+$, $2A^-$), each with rest mass energy $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The total energy of the four particles is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    *   $1876 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n4.  **Solve for Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   $\\gamma = 1876 / 1200 \\approx 1.5633$\n\n5.  **Solve for velocity (v):**\n    *   $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - (v/c)^2)$\n    *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 / \\gamma^2$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - (1 / \\gamma^2) = 1 - (1 / 1.5633^2) = 1 - (1 / 2.444) = 1 - 0.409$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 0.591$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$. This matches option A.\n\n**Skeptic:** The calculation seems correct and follows the established physical principles. The values used are standard. The result $v \\approx 0.77c$ is a direct consequence of the calculation. There are no apparent failure modes in the logic. The answer seems robust.\n\n**Decision:** The debate has converged. The calculation is straightforward and the result matches one of the options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",
