    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship Between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*). The formula is:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nThis is because the star's energy spreads out over a sphere, so the intensity of the radiation decreases with the square of the distance (proportional to 1/a²). The planet intercepts an amount of this energy proportional to its cross-sectional area. The planet then radiates this energy away over its entire surface area. The temperature at which this energy balance is achieved depends on the incident energy flux, which is related to the square root of the orbital distance. Since the star's properties and the planetary albedo are constant for all three planets, they cancel out when we take ratios.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ratios of the Orbital Distances**\n\nWe can use the relationship from step 1 to find the ratios of the orbital distances for the planets.\n\n*   **For Planet 1 and Planet 2:**\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = √(a2 / a1)\n    Given T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4, we have:\n    1.4 = √(a2 / a1)\n    Squaring both sides gives:\n    a2 / a1 = 1.4² = 1.96\n\n*   **For Planet 2 and Planet 3:**\n    (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = √(a3 / a2)\n    Given T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3, we have:\n    2.3 = √(a3 / a2)\n    Squaring both sides gives:\n    a3 / a2 = 2.3² = 5.29\n\n**3. Determine the Orbital Distance Ratio between Planet 3 and Planet 1**\n\nTo find the desired ratio of orbital periods, we first need the ratio of the orbital distances between Planet 3 and Planet 1 (a3 / a1). We can find this by multiplying the two ratios calculated above:\n\na3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1)\na3 / a1 = 5.29 * 1.96\na3 / a1 = 10.3684\n\n**4. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, this can be written as:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the periods of two planets is related to the ratio of their semi-major axes as follows:\n\n(P3 / P1)² = (a3 / a1)³\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Orbital Period Ratio**\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of a3 / a1 from step 3 into this equation:\n\nP3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)\nP3 / P1 = (10.3684)^1.5\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.3876\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information regarding the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is extraneous to this specific calculation, as the mass of the planets is negligible compared to the host star.\n\nThe final answer is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
