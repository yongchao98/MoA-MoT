    "The reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst is a self-metathesis of a chiral terminal alkene. Grubbs catalysts are well-known for their efficiency in olefin metathesis reactions, which involve the rearrangement of carbon-carbon double bonds. For a terminal alkene like 3-methylpent-1-ene, self-metathesis yields a new internal alkene and ethene, with the latter being excluded from the product count as per the question.\n\nThe reactant, 3-methylpent-1-ene, is chiral at the C-3 position. Since the starting material is racemic, it contains an equal mixture of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The metathesis reaction joins two of these molecules, creating a new C=C double bond at the C-4 position and resulting in the product 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. The original chiral centers are retained at the C-3 and C-6 positions of the product.\n\nThe self-metathesis can occur between three possible pairings of the enantiomers:\n*   Two (R) molecules reacting.\n*   Two (S) molecules reacting.\n*   One (R) and one (S) molecule reacting.\n\nLet's analyze the stereochemistry of the products from each reaction:\n1.  **(R) + (R) → (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene**: The product has two chiral centers, both with the (R) configuration. The new double bond at C-4 can be either *E* (trans) or *Z* (cis). This results in two distinct molecules, which are diastereomers of each other.\n2.  **(S) + (S) → (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene**: Similarly, this reaction produces a molecule with two (S) chiral centers. The C-4 double bond can again be either *E* or *Z*, yielding two diastereomeric products. The (3S, 6S) products are enantiomers of the corresponding (3R, 6R) products.\n3.  **(R) + (S) → (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene**: This reaction produces a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. This meso compound can also exist as two different diastereomers based on the geometry of the C-4 double bond (*E* or *Z*).\n\nIn total, these reactions produce three pairs of diastereomers, resulting in six possible stereoisomeric products.\n\nThe six possible products are:\n*   (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n*   (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n*   (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n*   (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n*   (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n*   (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n\nThus, there are 6 possible products (excluding ethene).\n\n<<<C>>>"
