    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar with respect to the atoms of the double bond and their immediate attachments. This planarity creates a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself specifies a single, specific stereoisomer using the (R), (S), and (E) designations. The presence of these descriptors indicates the existence of chiral centers and a defined stereochemistry. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3. Such compounds are called meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry and is a chiral molecule. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is **optically active**. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center. It is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, the -CH=CH- part of the ring, and the -CH2-CH2- part of the ring. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and thus **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one hydroxyl-bearing carbon and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule symmetrically. Due to this symmetry, the compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this molecule is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. An analysis of the structure reveals that there are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. Therefore, the molecule has no chiral center and is **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
