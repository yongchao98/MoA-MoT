    "The phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) are less severe than those of autosomal trisomies like Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) due to a mechanism called X-chromosome inactivation. This process epigenetically silences most of the genes on one of the X chromosomes, thus compensating for the extra chromosome's dose. In individuals with more than one X chromosome, including both normal XX females and XXY males, the genes on all but one X chromosome are largely rendered inactive.\n\nThis inactivation is an epigenetic event that occurs early in embryonic development, at the blastocyst stage. The process involves complex molecular changes to the chromosome's structure, including the methylation of histones by enzymes called histone methyltransferases. Specifically, the methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27) is a key event in initiating and establishing X-inactivation. This modification helps to compact the chromosome into a dense structure known as a Barr body, preventing the transcription of most of its genes.\n\nWhile X-inactivation silences the majority of genes on the extra X chromosome, about 12-15% of genes \"escape\" this process and remain active. The expression of these escape genes contributes to the specific features of Klinefelter's syndrome. In contrast, autosomal trisomies like Down's syndrome lack a comparable, chromosome-wide silencing mechanism. This leads to a more significant gene dosage imbalance, as nearly all genes on the extra autosome are overexpressed, resulting in more severe and wide-ranging phenotypic effects.\n\nOptions A and C describe potential causes of the nondisjunction events that lead to aneuploidies, not the mechanism that lessens their effects. Option B is a general process in embryonic development not specific to the dosage compensation difference between sex chromosomes and autosomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
