    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n*   **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by its set of quantum numbers, which in this case are the energy level quantum number (n) and the spin quantum number (m_s = +1/2 or -1/2). This means each energy level can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Energy Levels:** For a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by E_n = n² * E, where E = (π²ħ²)/(2mL²) and n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n### Calculation of Energy States\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n**1. Ground State Energy (E₀)**\n\nTo achieve the lowest possible total energy (the ground state), the four fermions are placed in the lowest available energy levels, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   Two particles fill the n=1 energy level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   The remaining two particles fill the n=2 energy level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total ground state energy is:\nE₀ = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\nE₀ = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E)\nE₀ = 2E + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E\n**E₀ = 10E**\n\n**2. First Excited State Energy (E₁)**\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, one particle is promoted from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2 and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   Therefore, one particle moves from n=2 to n=3.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE₁ = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE₁ = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E)\nE₁ = 2E + 4E + 9E\n**E₁ = 15E**\n\n**3. Second Excited State Energy (E₂)**\n\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration starting from the ground state. There are a few possibilities for excitation:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the possible energies (18E, 20E, and 22E), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\n**E₂ = 18E**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
