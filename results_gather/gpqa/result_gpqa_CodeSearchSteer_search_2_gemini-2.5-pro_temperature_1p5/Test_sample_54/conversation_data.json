    "Based on the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown organic compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Here is a detailed analysis of the spectrum:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet, which means the protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons. Its integration of 3H is characteristic of a methyl (CH₃) group. A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is typical for the methyl group of an acetate functionality (CH₃-COO-). All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n2.  **Signals for the Alkene Protons:** The remaining signals describe the rest of the molecule, which is an alkene chain attached to the acetate's oxygen.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet with an integration of 3H, corresponding to a methyl group that is coupled to a single proton. This suggests a CH₃-CH= structure, which is present in propenyl acetate but not butenyl acetate (which would have either a CH₃CH₂- group or a -CH₂-OAc group).\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is a doublet of quartets, integrating to a single proton. This proton is in the vinylic region (on the C=C double bond). The \"doublet\" splitting means it is coupled to one other vinyl proton. The \"quartet\" splitting means it is also coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (the one at 1.6 ppm). This confirms the CH₃-CH=CH-OAc structure.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a doublet, corresponding to the other vinyl proton. It is coupled only to the proton at 5.5 ppm. The key piece of information here is the coupling constant, *J*.\n\n3.  **Determining Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):** The magnitude of the coupling constant (*J*) between two protons on a double bond is diagnostic of their stereochemistry.\n    *   For *trans* protons, the coupling constant is typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n    *   For *cis* protons, the coupling constant is smaller, typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a *trans* configuration. This allows us to definitively rule out the *cis* isomers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe number of signals, their chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns all point to a propenyl acetate structure. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) of the vinyl protons confirms a *trans* stereochemistry. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
