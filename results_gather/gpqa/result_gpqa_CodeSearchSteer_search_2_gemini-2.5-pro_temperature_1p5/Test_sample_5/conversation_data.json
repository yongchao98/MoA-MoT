    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = ½ kr² + ³⁄₂ kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe can convert to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the relations:\nr² = x² + y²\nx = r cos(θ) ⇒ cos(θ) = x/r\n\nSubstituting these into the potential equation:\nV(x, y) = ½ k(x² + y²) + ³⁄₂ k(x² + y²) (x²/r²)\nSince r² = x² + y², the expression simplifies to:\nV(x, y) = ½ k(x² + y²) + ³⁄₂ kx²\nV(x, y) = ½ kx² + ½ ky² + ³⁄₂ kx²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + ½ ky²\n\nThis potential is the sum of two independent one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator potentials, V(x, y) = V(x) + V(y), where:\nV(x) = 2kx² = ½ (4k)x²\nV(y) = ½ ky²\n\nThe Schrödinger equation can be separated, and the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y components, E = Eₓ + Eᵧ.\n\nThe energy for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(z) = ½ k_eff z² is given by Eₙ = (n + ½)ħω, where the angular frequency is ω = √(k_eff/m).\n\nFor the x-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is kₓ = 4k.\nThe angular frequency is ωₓ = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m).\nThe energy eigenvalues are Eₙₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħωₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħ(2√(k/m)) = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m).\n\nFor the y-direction:\nThe spring constant is kᵧ = k.\nThe angular frequency is ωᵧ = √(k/m).\nThe energy eigenvalues are Eₙᵧ = (nᵧ + ½)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m).\n\nThe total energy spectrum E is the sum of Eₙₓ and Eₙᵧ:\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m) + (nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + 1 + nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + ³⁄₂)ħ√(k/m)\n\nwhere nₓ and nᵧ are the quantum numbers and can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
