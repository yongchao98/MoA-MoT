    "To determine which two compounds are in the mixture, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the potential compounds and compare it to the data provided.\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 integral ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\nThis implies that each compound in the 1:1 mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and the protons responsible for each of these singlets are equal in number. Let's analyze the spectra of the candidate molecules.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing a single signal. The four methyl groups are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two aromatic protons (at positions 5 and 6) equivalent. This results in a single aromatic signal. The four methyl groups are in two different chemical environments (1- and 4-methyl groups are equivalent, and 2- and 3-methyl groups are equivalent).\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Two singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule is unsymmetrical. The two aromatic protons (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments. Therefore, it would show two signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Multiple singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Due to symmetry, the four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one signal. The two ethyl groups are equivalent, but each ethyl group shows a quartet for the -CH2- group and a triplet for the -CH3- group due to spin-spin splitting. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** One quartet (4H) and one triplet (6H).\n\n**Analysis of the Mixture**\n\nLet's test the combination from option C, which includes **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for 2 protons).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for 2 protons).\n    *   The mixture would show **two distinct singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio and each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio would be **1:1**. This matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for 12 protons).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets (each for 6 protons).\n    *   The mixture would show a total of **three singlets** in the aliphatic region (assuming they have different chemical shifts).\n    *   The relative integration of these signals would be based on the number of protons they represent: 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to a ratio of **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nNo other combination of the given options fits the spectral data. For instance, any mixture containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would result in three aromatic signals in total, and any mixture with 1,4-diethylbenzene would show quartets and triplets instead of only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds present in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
