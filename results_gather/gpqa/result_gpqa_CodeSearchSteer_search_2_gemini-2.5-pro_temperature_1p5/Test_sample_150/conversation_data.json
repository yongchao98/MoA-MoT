    "To find the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t, we follow these steps based on the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n### 1. Define the State and the Observable\n\n*   The state of the system `|ψ⟩` is given by the column matrix:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]\n    ```\n*   The observable `P` is represented by the matrix:\n    ```\n    P = [ 0, 1/√2,  0 ]\n        [ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]\n        [ 0, 1/√2,  0 ]\n    ```\n\n### 2. Find the Eigenvalues of the Observable\n\nTo find the possible outcomes of the measurement, we need to find the eigenvalues (λ) of the operator `P` by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n```\ndet([ -λ, 1/√2,  0 ],\n    [ 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ],\n    [ 0, 1/√2,  -λ ]) = 0\n```\nThis expands to:\n-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0\n-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0\n-λ³ + λ = 0\nλ(1 - λ²) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.\n\n### 3. Find the Eigenvector for the Desired Outcome\n\nThe question asks for the probability of measuring the value 0, which corresponds to the eigenvalue λ = 0. We need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` associated with this eigenvalue by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\n```\n[ 0, 1/√2,  0 ]   [x]   [0]\n[ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ] * [y] = [0]\n[ 0, 1/√2,  0 ]   [z]   [0]\n```\nThis results in the following system of equations:\n1.  (1/√2)y = 0  =>  y = 0\n2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  =>  x + z = 0  =>  x = -z\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We can choose x=1 to get an unnormalized eigenvector `[1, 0, -1]`.\n\n### 4. Normalize the State Vector and the Eigenvector\n\nThe probability calculation requires both the state vector of the system and the eigenvector of the observable to be normalized.\n\n*   **Normalize the state vector `|ψ⟩`:**\n    The squared norm is `||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    The normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` is `(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`.\n\n*   **Normalize the eigenvector `|v₀⟩`:**\n    The squared norm is `||v₀||² = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector `|λ₀⟩` is `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Probability\n\nAccording to the Born rule, the probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the squared modulus of the inner product of the corresponding normalized eigenvector and the normalized state vector of the system. The formula is:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨λ|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\nFor our case, λ = 0:\n`Prob(0) = |⟨λ₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product `⟨λ₀|ψ_norm⟩`. `⟨λ₀|` is the conjugate transpose of `|λ₀⟩`.\n`⟨λ₀| = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n\n`⟨λ₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] · (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n`⟨λ₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * [(1 * -1) + (0 * 2) + (-1 * 1)]`\n`⟨λ₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nFinally, square the modulus of this result to get the probability:\n`Prob(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
