    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at the two specified points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    Concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n    Moles = M₁ × V₁ = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Diluted solution:**\n    Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    Total volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    New concentration (M₂) = Moles / V₂ = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. Titration Reaction and Equivalence Point\n\nThe titration reaction between the weak acid (acetic acid) and the strong base (NaOH) is:\nCH₃COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → CH₃COONa(aq) + H₂O(l)\n\nFirst, we determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point, where the moles of base equal the initial moles of acid.\n*   **Volume of NaOH at equivalence (V_eq):**\n    Moles of acid = Moles of base\n    0.001 mol = (0.1 mol/L) × V_eq\n    V_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n### 3. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n*   **Moles of NaOH added:** 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH remaining:** 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n*   **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed:** 0.00025 mol\n\nTo find the pH of this buffer, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n*   **pKa calculation:** The acid dissociation constant (Ka) is 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** pH = pKa + log(\\[A⁻]/\\[HA])\n    Since the volumes are the same for the acid and its conjugate base, we can use the ratio of their moles.\n    pH = 4.733 + log(0.00025 mol / 0.00075 mol)\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### 4. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted to form acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻). The solution now contains a weak base.\n*   **Total volume:** Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]):** Moles / Total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻):\nCH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\nWe need the base ionization constant (Kb) for acetate.\n*   **Kb calculation:** Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0x10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405x10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻]:** We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction.\n    Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405x10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming x is very small, we can simplify:\n    x² = 5.405x10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02 = 1.081x10⁻¹¹\n    x = \\[OH⁻] = √(1.081x10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288x10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.288x10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>"
