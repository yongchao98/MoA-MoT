    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts traveling in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c.\n\nThe formula for relative velocity (v_rel) is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of each astronaut. The total energy of a particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):**\n\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Next, calculate the energy (E1):\n    `E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5mc²`\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):**\n\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 = 1.1547`\n*   Next, calculate the energy (E2):\n    `E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.4641mc²`\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\n*   The total energy is the sum of the individual energies:\n    `E_total = E1 + E2`\n    `E_total = 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc²`\n    `E_total ≈ 5.9641mc²`\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy is approximately **5.96mc²**. Comparing these results with the given options, we find that they match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
