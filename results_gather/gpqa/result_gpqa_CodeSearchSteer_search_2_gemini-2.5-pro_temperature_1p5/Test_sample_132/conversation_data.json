    "The search results confirm that the provided Ka values for phosphoric acid are standard and the method for solving the problem is correct. The key steps are:\n\n1.  Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n2.  Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with the second dissociation constant (Ka₂) to find the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer.\n3.  Use the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation (Ka₃) to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻).\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate Moles of Each Component:**\n\n*   **KH₂PO₄:** This salt dissociates to provide H₂PO₄⁻ ions.\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:** This salt dissociates to provide HPO₄²⁻ ions.\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n\n**2. Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations:**\n\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n*   **[H₂PO₄⁻]** = 0.007348 moles / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **[HPO₄²⁻]** = 0.005618 moles / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n\nThe primary buffer equilibrium is between H₂PO₄⁻ (the acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (the conjugate base), which is governed by Ka₂.\n\n*   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\nUsing the expression for Ka₂:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * 1.308\n[H⁺] = 8.110 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO₄³⁻] Concentration:**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by Ka₃.\n\n*   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\nUsing the expression for Ka₃:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nWe use the equilibrium concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (0.02809 M) and the calculated [H⁺]. Because Ka₃ is extremely small, the amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is negligible and its initial concentration is a valid approximation for its equilibrium concentration.\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹² * 0.02809 M) / (8.110 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] = 5.0562 x 10⁻¹⁴ / 8.110 x 10⁻⁸\n[PO₄³⁻] = 0.62345 x 10⁻⁶ M\n[PO₄³⁻] = 6.2345 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result is very close to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nFinal check of the values:\n*   Initial concentrations seem correct.\n*   Calculation of [H⁺] is correct.\n*   Calculation of [PO₄³⁻] is correct.\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
