    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we analyze the given Lagrangian interaction term:\n\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu} $$\n\n### 1. Determining the Mass Dimension of κ\n\nIn four-dimensional spacetime, the action S is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density  over spacetime, S = ∫d⁴x L.\n\n*   The spacetime volume element d⁴x has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = -4.\n*   For the action to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density  must have a mass dimension of [L] = 4.\n\nNow, we determine the mass dimensions of the fields in the interaction term:\n\n*   **Fermion field ψ**: The kinetic term for a fermion is  `ψ(iγ^μ∂_μ - m)ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have `[ψ] + [∂] + [ψ] = 4`. Since `[∂]` = 1, we get `2[ψ] + 1 = 4`, which implies `[ψ] = 3/2`. Therefore, `[ψ̄]` also has a mass dimension of 3/2.\n*   **Field strength tensor F<sup>μν</sup>**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `-(1/4)F_μνF^μν`. This term must have a mass dimension of 4. So, `2[F^μν] = 4`, which gives `[F^μν] = 2`.\n*   **Sigma matrix σ<sub>μν</sub>**: This is defined as `(i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`, a commutator of gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless constants. Therefore, `[σ_μν] = 0`.\n\nNow, we can find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ by ensuring the entire Lagrangian term has a mass dimension of 4:\n\n`[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F^μν] = 4`\n`4 = [κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2`\n`4 = [κ] + 3 + 2`\n`4 = [κ] + 5`\n`[κ] = 4 - 5 = -1`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 2. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants, a method known as power-counting. The general criteria are as follows:\n\n*   If all coupling constants have a **non-negative** mass dimension (`[g] ≥ 0`), the theory is generally renormalizable.\n*   If any coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension (`[g] < 0`), the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because higher-order corrections in the perturbative expansion would introduce increasingly severe divergences.\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant κ has a mass dimension of -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory described by this interaction Lagrangian is non-renormalizable. Such non-renormalizable theories are often interpreted as effective field theories, valid only up to a certain energy scale.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and because this is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
