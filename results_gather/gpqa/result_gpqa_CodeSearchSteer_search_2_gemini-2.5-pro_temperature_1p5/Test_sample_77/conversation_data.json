    "The scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, c, meaning the field experienced at a point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was generated by the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials starts from the general retarded potential formulas and applies them to a point charge. Let's analyze the expressions given in the options based on the standard form of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe standard formulas for the scalar potential ($V$ or $\\phi$) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) are often written as:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere:\n*   $R$ is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $\\vec{n}$ is the unit vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n*   The subscript $t_r$ means the quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time.\n\nNow, let's translate this into the notation provided in the question:\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector is $d$, so $R=d$.\n*   The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n*   The velocity of the charge is $\\vec{v}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the denominator term $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n$d \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\right) = d \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc} \\right) = d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nTo simplify, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\nFor the scalar potential $V$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that they match option C exactly. Option A has the wrong sign in the denominator. Options B and D use the static potential form, which is incorrect for a moving charge where retardation effects are significant. It is also worth noting that the vector and scalar potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$, which holds true for the expressions in option C, since $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
