    "The search results confirm the formula I derived. Specifically, result provides the formula for the sum of masses in a spectroscopic binary: `m1 + m2 = (P / (2πG)) * (v1r + v2r)³ / sin³(i)`.\n\nHere:\n*   `m1 + m2` is the total mass of the system.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `v1r` and `v2r` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities (what I called `K1` and `K2`).\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing binaries. As result mentions, for eclipsing binaries, the inclination `i` is known to be close to 90 degrees (`i ≈ 90◦`), which means `sin(i)` is approximately 1. Therefore, `sin³(i)` is also approximately 1.\n\nThis confirms my formula:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K_total)³`\n\nMy calculation steps were as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the given data:**\n    *   **System 1:** P1 = 2 years, K1 = 10 km/s, K2 = 5 km/s.\n    *   **System 2:** P2 = 1 year, K1 = 15 km/s, K2 = 10 km/s.\n\n2.  **Calculate the sum of radial velocity amplitudes for each system:**\n    *   **System 1:** K_total_1 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n    *   **System 2:** K_total_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n\n3.  **Set up the ratio of the total masses (M1 / M2):**\n    `M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K_total_1)³] / [P2 * (K_total_2)³]`\n\n4.  **Substitute the values:**\n    `M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n\n5.  **Calculate the final decimal value:**\n    `54 / 125 = 0.432`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nThe steps, formula, and final calculation are consistent and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nTo determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M1 / M2). The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary can be derived from Kepler's third law and the radial velocity observations.\n\nThe formula for the total mass (M) of a binary system is given by:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = [P / (2πG)] * [(K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)]\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the sky.\n\nSince both systems are described as exhibiting eclipses, it is a standard assumption that their orbits are viewed edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, which simplifies the formula significantly.\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the mass of system_2 (M_sys2) can be calculated as follows:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nHere, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out.\n\nFor **system_1**:\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\nFor **system_2**:\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432, which is closest to the value given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
