    "An N-sided polygonal aperture with a constant apothem 'a' will approach the shape of a circle with radius 'a' as N becomes infinitely large. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the intensity minima (dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe general formula for the angular position, θ, of the minima is given by:\n\nsin(θ) = ρ / (k * a)\n\nwhere:\n*   k is the wavenumber, given by 2π/λ.\n*   a is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   ρ represents the non-zero roots (zeros) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nSubstituting k = 2π/λ, the formula becomes:\n\nsin(θ) = ρ * λ / (2π * a)\n\nThe problem states that small angles can be assumed, so we can use the approximation sin(θ) ≈ θ. Thus, the angular position of the n-th minimum is:\n\nθ_n = ρ_n * λ / (2π * a)\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(x), which are denoted as ρ₁ and ρ₂. From mathematical tables and physics resources, these values are approximately:\n*   ρ₁ = 3.8317\n*   ρ₂ = 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):\n    θ₁ = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\n*   Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):\n    θ₂ = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\n\nThe angular distance (Δθ) between these two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nThis result is closest to the option 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<C>>>"
