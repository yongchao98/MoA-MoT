    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the substance A4:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The clue that substance A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions is critical. The first compound of a noble gas was created in 1962 by Neil Bartlett when he reacted platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) with xenon. This strongly suggests that element **Y is Platinum (Pt)**. A1, the bright-red substance, is **platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A2:** The problem states that A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) of 31.96%. Let's examine the known fluorides of platinum.\n    *   **Platinum(V) fluoride (PtF₅):** It exists as a deep-red solid tetramer [PtF₅]₄. The mass percentage of fluorine in the PtF₅ monomer is 32.75%. This value is very close to the 31.96% given in the problem, with the small difference likely due to rounding in the problem's data. Therefore, **A2 is PtF₅**. The decomposition is PtF₆ → PtF₅ + ½F₂.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A3:** A3 is obtained by fluorinating platinum and can also interact with xenon. Platinum tetrafluoride (PtF₄) can be formed by the direct fluorination of platinum. Furthermore, platinum reacts with xenon tetrafluoride to produce platinum tetrafluoride and xenon gas (XeF₄ + Pt → PtF₄ + Xe), which qualifies as an interaction. Thus, **A3 is PtF₄**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A4:** This is the core of the problem. Here is what we know about A4:\n    *   It exists as a hot, colorless, concentrated solution.\n    *   Platinum metal (Y) is added to this solution in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5.\n    *   The known simple platinum fluorides (PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆) are all colored solids and would not form a colorless solution. Platinum(II) fluoride is insoluble in water. This suggests A4 is not one of the simple binary fluorides of platinum.\n    *   The problem's context is rich with platinum and xenon chemistry. Therefore, A4 is likely another fluorine-containing compound, possibly another strong fluorinating agent. Candidates include interhalogen compounds or other xenon fluorides.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Candidates for A4 based on Molecular Weight:**\n    *   **Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆):** This is a strong fluorinating agent. It is a colorless solid that could form a colorless solution. It reacts with platinum. The products of this reaction would be various platinum fluorides, which are known to decompose in water. The molecular weight of XeF₆ is approximately 245.3 g/mol. This value falls into the range of **220-240**.\n    *   **Iodine pentafluoride (IF₅):** This is another strong, colorless fluorinating agent. It has a molecular weight of approximately 221.9 g/mol. This value also falls into the range of **220-240**.\n\nBoth XeF₆ and IF₅ fit the description and lead to the same molecular weight range. Given the thematic consistency with xenon chemistry throughout the problem, XeF₆ is a particularly fitting candidate.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecular weight of substance A4 must fall within the 220-240 g/mol range.\n\n<<<A>>>"
