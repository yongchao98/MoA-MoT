    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the partial waves is not permitted.\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three conservation laws and one statistical rule:\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The quantum numbers of the final two-nucleon (NN) system must adhere to the given relation `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n\nLet's first analyze the initial state and the conditions for the final state.\n\n**Initial State: `1S0`**\n*   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have `2S+1 = 1` â‡’ `S = 0`.\n*   The letter 'S' denotes the orbital angular momentum `L = 0`.\n*   The subscript gives the total angular momentum `J = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial NN state is given by `P(NN_i) = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**Particle X**\n*   It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n*   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter: `s` (L=0), `p` (L=1), `d` (L=2), `f` (L=3).\n*   We will assume particle X has no intrinsic spin (`S(X) = 0`), which is a standard assumption for particles like pions denoted this way. Its total angular momentum is therefore `J(X) = L(X)`.\n\n**Conditions for the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics:**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, the isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`. Using the given Pauli statistics relation:\n    `T(NN_f) = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    `0 = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies that the sum `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f)` must be **odd**. Any final NN state where `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f)` is even is forbidden.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:**\n    `P(initial) = P(final)`\n    `P(NN_i) = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^L(X)`\n    `(+1) = (-1)^L(NN_f) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`\n    `(+1) = (-1) * (-1)^(L(NN_f) + L(X))`\n    This requires `(-1)^(L(NN_f) + L(X))` to be `-1`, which means the sum `L(NN_f) + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:**\n    `J(initial) = J(final)`\n    The initial angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`.\n    The final total angular momentum `J(final)` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum `J(NN_f)` and particle X's angular momentum `J(X)`. To sum to zero, they must be equal in magnitude: `J(NN_f) = J(X)`.\n    Since we assume `S(X)=0`, we have `J(X) = L(X)`.\n    Therefore, the condition is `J(NN_f) = L(X)`.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Parity check:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 0+1 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **AM check:** `J(NN_f) = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. (`1=1`). -> **OK**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S+L = 3+2 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Parity check:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 2+1 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **AM check:** `J(NN_f) = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. (`1=1`). -> **OK**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L(X)=0`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (Even). -> **FAIL**\n*   This reaction is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final NN state. For completeness, we check the other laws:\n*   **Parity check:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **AM check:** `J(NN_f) = 0`, `L(X) = 0`. (`0=0`). -> **OK**\n    Despite satisfying parity and angular momentum conservation, the violation of the Pauli principle makes this reaction forbidden.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L(X)=3`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **Parity check:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 2+3 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\n*   **AM check:** `J(NN_f) = 3`, `L(X) = 3`. (`3=3`). -> **OK**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\nThe only transition that is not permitted is C, as it violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final two-nucleon state.\n\n<<<C>>>"
