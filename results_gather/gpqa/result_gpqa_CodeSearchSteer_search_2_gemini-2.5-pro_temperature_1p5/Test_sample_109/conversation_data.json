    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we must consider two factors for each star: its visibility from both locations and its brightness.\n\n**1. Observational Requirements:**\n\n*   **Brightness:** A star must have an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 to be observed by HIRES at Keck, and brighter than 17 to be seen by ESPRESSO. Therefore, for a star to be detectable by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude **brighter than 16 mag** (`mv < 16`).\n*   **Visibility:** The Paranal Observatory is in Chile (Southern Hemisphere) and the Keck Observatory is in Hawaii, USA (Northern Hemisphere). A star must be visible in the sky from both locations.\n    *   Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately 24.6° S. It can observe stars with a declination north of approximately -65°.\n    *   W. M. Keck Observatory is located at a latitude of about 19.8° N. It can observe stars with a declination south of approximately -70°.\n    *   Therefore, a star must have a declination (DEC) between roughly -65° and +70° to be visible from both sites.\n\n**2. Star-by-Star Analysis:**\n\n*   **Star1:** This star has a declination of -75°. This is too far south to be visible from the Keck Observatory. Thus, it cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star2:** The declination is +55°, making it visible from both observatories. However, its apparent V magnitude is 16.5 mag, which is fainter than the 16 mag limit for HIRES. Therefore, it is not detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star3:** This star has a declination of +48°, which is visible from both locations. Its apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the 16 mag limit for HIRES and the 17 mag limit for ESPRESSO. Thus, **Star3 is observable by both instruments**.\n\n*   **Star4:** The declination is -48°, placing it within the visibility range of both observatories. Its apparent V magnitude is calculated as `mv = Mv - 5 + 5*log10(d) + Av`. Using the given values: `mv = 15.5 - 5 + 5*log10(10) + (3.1 * 0.4) = 16.74` mag. This is fainter than the required 16 mag for HIRES. Therefore, it cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star5:** This star's declination is +60°, making it visible to both. Its apparent V magnitude is calculated from its absolute magnitude and distance: `mv = Mv - 5 + 5*log10(d)`. Using the given values: `mv = 16.5 - 5 + 5*log10(5) = 14.99` mag. This magnitude is brighter than the limit of both spectrographs. Thus, **Star5 is observable by both instruments**.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star3 and Star5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for the two observatories.\n\n<<<A>>>"
