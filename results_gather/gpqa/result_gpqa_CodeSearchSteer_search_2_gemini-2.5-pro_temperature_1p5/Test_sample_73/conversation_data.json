    "This problem describes a radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential decay model. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability that an atom will decay in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\nThe probability `P(t)` that an atom decays within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n`P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n`0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of the atom *not* decaying (surviving) in 100 minutes:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nThis value, `e^(-100λ)`, represents the survival probability over 100 minutes. We can use this to find the probability of decay over a different time interval without explicitly solving for λ.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is simply the probability of an atom decaying in any 150-minute period.\n\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nTo calculate this, we can manipulate the expression to use the survival probability we found earlier:\n`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value of `e^(-100λ)`:\n`P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n\nFinally, calculate the decay probability:\n`P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n### 3. Final Answer\nConverting the probability to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
