    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem, applying the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nFirst, we apply the law of conservation of energy. The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (E_e) = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Energy of the positron (E_p) = γ_p * m_p * c² = 2 * m_p * c²\n    *   Since an electron and a positron have the same mass (m_e = m_p), the total initial energy is:\n        E_initial = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):**\n    After annihilation, two photons are produced. The problem states they have the same energy, let's call it E_γ.\n    *   E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ\n\n*   **Equating Initial and Final Energy:**\n    E_initial = E_final\n    6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_γ\n    E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²\n\nThe energy of each photon is three times the rest energy of an electron.\n\n### 2. Conservation of Momentum\n\nNext, we apply the law of conservation of momentum. Momentum is a vector, so we must consider its components along the horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis).\n\n*   **Initial Momentum (P_initial):**\n    The relativistic momentum *p* can be calculated from the Lorentz factor using the formula p = m_e * c * sqrt(γ² - 1).\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e): Moving from the left (+x direction).\n        p_e = m_e * c * sqrt(4² - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(15)\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p): Moving from the right (-x direction).\n        p_p = -m_e * c * sqrt(2² - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(3)\n    *   Total initial momentum in the x-direction:\n        P_initial,x = m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n    *   The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero, as both particles move along the horizontal axis.\n\n*   **Final Momentum (P_final):**\n    The two photons move away from the collision point. One moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". Because they have the same energy, their paths are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis. Let θ be the angle of each photon's direction with the horizontal axis.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is p_γ = E_γ / c. From our energy calculation, p_γ = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n    *   Final momentum in the x-direction (P_final,x):\n        P_final,x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n    *   Final momentum in the y-direction (P_final,y):\n        P_final,y = p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-θ) = p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0\n    *   The final momentum in the y-direction is zero, which is consistent with the initial state.\n\n*   **Equating Initial and Final Momentum (x-component):**\n    P_initial,x = P_final,x\n    m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Angle\n\nNow we can solve for the angle θ.\n\n*   **Solve for cos(θ):**\n    The terms m_e * c cancel out from both sides:\n    cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n*   **Calculate the value:**\n    Using the approximate values sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873 and sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732:\n    cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n\n*   **Find the angle θ:**\n    θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees\n\n*   **Find the total angle between the photons:**\n    The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is 2θ.\n    Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1 = 138.2 degrees\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<A>>>"
