    "The provided search results confirm the general principles of calculating free metal ion concentration from a metal-ligand complex. Several sources discuss the use of the formation constant (K_f) or dissociation constant (K_d) for this type of calculation. The methodology involves setting up an equilibrium expression based on the dissociation of the complex.\n\nThe dissociation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex is:\n[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation is K_d, which is the reciprocal of the formation constant, K_f.\nK_d = 1 / K_f\n\nGiven:\n- Stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA, [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻]initial = 0.02 M\n- Formation constant, K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nFirst, we calculate the dissociation constant, K_d:\nK_d = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nNext, we set up an equilibrium table (ICE table):\n- **Initial:**\n  - [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n  - [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n  - [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n- **Change:**\n  - [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] = -x\n  - [Ca²⁺] = +x\n  - [EDTA⁴⁻] = +x\n- **Equilibrium:**\n  - [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n  - [Ca²⁺] = x\n  - [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small. This implies that the complex dissociates very little, and thus 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by assuming that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], at equilibrium is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B. The assumption of an \"ideal pH\" is crucial because the speciation of EDTA is pH-dependent. An ideal pH (typically pH > 10) ensures that the predominant form of the ligand is EDTA⁴⁻, allowing for the direct use of the given absolute formation constant.\n\n<<<B>>>"
