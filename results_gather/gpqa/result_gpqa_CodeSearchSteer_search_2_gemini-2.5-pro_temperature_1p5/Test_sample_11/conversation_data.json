    "### Analysis of Pion Decay\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). To find the kinetic energies of the product particles, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, assuming the neutrino is massless, which is a standard approximation in this context.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_πc²) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μc²) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n*   E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n\nAfter the decay, this energy is distributed among the rest mass and kinetic energies of the resulting particles.\n*   E_final = (m_μc² + KE_μ) + (m_νc² + KE_ν)\n\nAssuming a massless neutrino (m_ν = 0), the equation becomes:\n*   139.6 MeV = (105.7 MeV + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n\nThe sum of the kinetic energies of the products is the Q-value of the decay:\n*   KE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero. This implies that the muon and the neutrino are emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (p).\n*   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nThe energy of the massless neutrino is given by E_ν = p*c. Since its rest mass is zero, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n*   KE_ν = p*c\n\nThe momentum p can be calculated from the conservation laws. A derived formula for the momentum of the decay products in a two-body decay from rest is:\n*   p*c = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2 * m_πc² ]\n*   p*c = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n*   p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\n*   p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is:\n*   KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe total energy of the muon is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_μ = √[(p*c)² + (m_μc²)²]. Its kinetic energy is KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc².\n*   E_μ = √[(29.78)² + (105.7)²] = √[886.85 + 11172.49] = √[12059.34] ≈ 109.81 MeV\n*   KE_μ = 109.81 MeV - 105.7 MeV ≈ 4.11 MeV\n\nThus, the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.\n\nThe final calculated values are:\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_μ):** ~4.12 MeV\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_ν):** ~29.8 MeV\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
