    "Here is a detailed analysis of the products from each reaction and how they would appear in the different types of HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position (S-configuration).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol. LAH is a powerful, nonselective hydride-transfer reagent.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl from either face, two stereoisomers will be formed. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because one stereocenter is the same (5S) while the other is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, prochiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBHâ‚„) is a milder reducing agent that effectively reduces aldehydes and ketones to alcohols. It will reduce both ketone groups in pentane-2,4-dione.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, resulting in the formation of pentane-2,4-diol. Three possible stereoisomers can be formed:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral and is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture in HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n\n*   **Diastereomers**, having different physical properties, can be separated by normal-phase HPLC.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore co-elute (appear as a single peak).\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will separate, giving **one peak**.\n*   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will not separate from each other and will elute together as **one peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers) are structurally distinct and have different polarities compared to the products from Reaction II (C5 diols), so it is expected that they will all elute at different times.\n\nThus, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n\n*   A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers from each other: diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give **one peak**.\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give a separate **peak** (as it's a diastereomer to the first).\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol will give **one peak**.\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will be resolved from its enantiomer, giving a separate **peak**.\n5.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is structurally different from the other isomers and will have its own distinct **peak**.\n\nTherefore, all five stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated, resulting in a total of **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
