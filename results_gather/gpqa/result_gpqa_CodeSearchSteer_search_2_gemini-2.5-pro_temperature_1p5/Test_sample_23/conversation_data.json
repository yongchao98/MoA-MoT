    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of Hydrogen (H) = 14.28%\n    *   Mass % of Carbon (C) = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%\n*   To find the ratio of atoms, we divide the percentages by the atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1):\n    *   Ratio C = 85.72 / 12 ≈ 7.14\n    *   Ratio H = 14.28 / 1 ≈ 14.28\n*   The simplest whole number ratio of H to C is 14.28 / 7.14 ≈ 2. So, the empirical formula is CH₂.\n*   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A hydrocarbon with the general formula (CH₂)n must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n), as alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2.\n*   Z is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Searching for common cycloalkane solvents points towards cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) as a very common choice. Cyclohexane fits the formula CnH2n (for n=6) and is a widely used industrial solvent.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Analysis of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic. Simple bromination of benzene, an aromatic compound, requires a catalyst and does not occur with just bromine water.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane (Z). This means the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Let the components of Y be Z (cyclohexane) and another liquid, let's call it C. The hydrogenation of benzene (C₆H₆) yields cyclohexane. Benzene is a liquid at room temperature and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   This makes Y an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C₆H₆)** and **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y by heating with platinum. This process is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   Let the two components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B. The reaction is:\n    A + B → benzene (C₆H₆) + cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)\n*   In this reaction, one component of X is oxidized to benzene, and the other is reduced to cyclohexane.\n*   Since hydrogenation of both components of X gives cyclohexane, both A and B must be C₆ cyclic compounds.\n*   Let A be the compound that is oxidized to benzene, and B be the compound that is reduced to cyclohexane. The overall reaction shows that hydrogen atoms are transferred from A to B.\n    *   `A → C₆H₆ + 2H` (Oxidation)\n    *   `B + 2H → C₆H₁₂` (Reduction)\n*   From this, we can deduce the molecular formulas of A and B.\n    *   B must have two fewer hydrogen atoms than cyclohexane: C₆H₁₀. This is **cyclohexene**.\n    *   A must have two more hydrogen atoms than benzene: C₆H₈. This is a **cyclohexadiene**.\n*   So, Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Both cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water, which matches the description of mixture X.\n    *   The problem also specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene, there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and **1,4-cyclohexadiene** (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene in mixture X must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of:\n    1.  **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**\n    2.  **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of each component).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
