    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+/(M+2) ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   All the proposed structures have a chemical formula of C₇H₅ClO₂. The calculated molecular weight for this formula is approximately 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This very broad absorption is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. The position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   The IR data points towards a carboxylic acid. Options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid) are carboxylic acids. Option B (Phenyl chloroformate) is an acyl chloride ester, which would lack the broad O-H peak. Option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) has a hydroxyl and an aldehyde group, but the O-H peak of a phenol is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid, and it lacks the specific carboxylic acid proton signal in the NMR.\n\n### 3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Its integration as 1H confirms one such proton. This further supports the carboxylic acid assignment and rules out options B and C.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   The spectrum shows two signals in the aromatic region, both of which are doublets, and each integrates to 2H.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is indicative of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring results in only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (Option A)** is *ortho*-substituted. This would result in four unique aromatic proton signals, creating a more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (Option D)** is *para*-substituted. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm). The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom are less deshielded and appear slightly upfield (7.72 ppm). This predicted pattern perfectly matches the experimental data. Published NMR data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirms these chemical shifts.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic methods:\n*   **MS** confirms a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid proton and shows a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nAll data are consistent only with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
