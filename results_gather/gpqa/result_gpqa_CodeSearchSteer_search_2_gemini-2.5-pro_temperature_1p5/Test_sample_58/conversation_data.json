    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which, if any, is in excess after neutralization.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it completely dissociates, and each formula unit provides two hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n### Step 2: Perform Neutralization Reactions\n\nThe neutralization reactions occur in steps, with the strong acid and strong base reacting first.\n\n1.  **Reaction of Strong Acid (HCl) and Strong Base (Ba(OH)₂):**\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H⁺ ions will react with the OH⁻ ions in a 1:1 ratio. Since there are more moles of OH⁻, the H⁺ will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n2.  **Reaction of Weak Acid (CH₃COOH) and Remaining Strong Base (OH⁻):**\n    *   Now, the remaining 0.100 moles of the strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   The OH⁻ ions will react with the CH₃COOH in a 1:1 ratio. Since there are more moles of OH⁻ than CH₃COOH, the weak acid will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Final pH\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ from a strong base. The presence of this excess strong base will dictate the pH of the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n2.  **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
