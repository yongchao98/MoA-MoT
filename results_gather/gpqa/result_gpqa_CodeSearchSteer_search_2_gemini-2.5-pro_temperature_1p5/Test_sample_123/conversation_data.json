    "To determine the necessary Lorentz factor, we can use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n### Understanding the Physics\n\nThe number of particles that survive after a certain time follows an exponential decay law. In the laboratory's frame of reference, the lifetime of a fast-moving particle is \"stretched\" or dilated due to its high velocity. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law**: The fraction of particles, *f*, that remain after a time *t* in the laboratory frame is given by:\n    *f* = e<sup>-(t / T_lab)</sup>\n    where T_lab is the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (T_lab) is related to its lifetime in its own rest frame, called the proper lifetime (τ), by the Lorentz factor (γ). The formula is:\n    T_lab = γ * τ\n\n3.  **Time of Flight**: The particles are described as ultra-relativistic, meaning their velocity *v* is very close to the speed of light, *c*. The time it takes for them to travel from the center to the detector wall of radius *R* is:\n    *t* ≈ *R / c*\n\n### Applying to the Two Scenarios\n\nBy combining these equations, we get a formula for the fraction of surviving particles:\n*f* = e<sup>-(R / (c * γ * τ))</sup>\n\nLet's analyze the two situations presented in the problem.\n\n**Scenario 1: Initial State**\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (f₁): 1/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁): ~20\n*   Detector radius (R): 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives:\n1/3 = e<sup>-(30 / (c * 20 * τ))</sup>\n\nTo solve for the unknown proper lifetime (or more precisely, the constant term `c*τ`), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -ln(3) = -(30 / (20 * c * τ))\nln(3) = 30 / (20 * c * τ)\n\nThis equation establishes a relationship based on the initial conditions.\n\n**Scenario 2: Desired State**\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (f₂): 2/3\n*   Required Lorentz factor (γ₂): **This is what we need to find.**\n*   Detector radius (R): 30 m (this remains the same)\n\nFor this new scenario, the equation is:\n2/3 = e<sup>-(30 / (c * γ₂ * τ))</sup>\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\nln(2/3) = -(30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))\n-ln(3/2) = -(30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)\n\n### Calculating the New Lorentz Factor\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  ln(3) = 30 / (20 * c * τ)\n2.  ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)\n\nWe can solve this by setting the constant part `30 / (c * τ)` equal in both.\nFrom (1): 30 / (c * τ) = 20 * ln(3)\nFrom (2): 30 / (c * τ) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)\n\nTherefore:\nγ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\n\nNow, we can solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(3/2)]\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
