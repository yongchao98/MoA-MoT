    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`) is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy:\n    `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV`.\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`, which implies `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   Now we solve the system of equations:\n    *   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2` into the sum equation:\n        `2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is:\n        `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) of the fragments comes from the conversion of mass into energy. It is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 Using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum.\n*   From the conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta, so `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   The ratio of their classical kinetic energies is:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\n    `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`:\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1 Value\n\nFor the relativistic case, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where total energy `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   This gives `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   Again, from momentum conservation `|p1| = |p2|`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, so `T2 = 3 - T1`. Substitute this and the mass-energies into the equation:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   Expand and solve for T1:\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + T1^2 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation for T1 is:\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Convert the result to Mega-electron Volts (MeV), knowing that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>"
