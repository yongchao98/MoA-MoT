    "Analysis of the Synthesis Pathway\n\nThe goal is to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). Its structure is C₆H₁₁-C≡CH. It contains 8 carbon atoms.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break down this IUPAC name:\n    *   The parent molecule is \"cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\". This is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached. Its structure is C₆H₁₁-CHO.\n    *   The substituent \"(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)\" is attached at position \"1\" of the cyclohexane ring (the same carbon that holds the -CHO group).\n    *   The substituent group is -CH(OH)-C₆H₁₁.\n    *   This final product is the result of an aldol condensation between two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁-CHO). One molecule acts as the nucleophile (forming an enolate) and the other as the electrophile. The product's formula is C₁₄H₂₄O₂.\n\nThe overall strategy must first involve the synthesis of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (a 7-carbon aldehyde) from ethynylcyclohexane (an 8-carbon alkyne), followed by a base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's examine each option step-by-step to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation of the Alkyne**\n    *   Ethynylcyclohexane has an acidic terminal proton which can be removed by a strong base like sodium amide (NaNH₂) to form a sodium acetylide salt (C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻Na⁺). This is a potent nucleophile.\n    *   In **options B and C**, this acetylide is reacted with methyl chloride (CH₃Cl) in an alkylation reaction to form 1-cyclohexylpropyne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃). This step adds a carbon atom, resulting in a 9-carbon internal alkyne.\n    *   In **option D**, ethyl chloride is used, which would form 1-cyclohexylbutyne.\n    *   In **option A**, NaNH₂ is paired with methanol, a protic solvent. A strong base like NaNH₂ would be neutralized by methanol before it could deprotonate the alkyne, making this step non-viable.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reduction of the Alkyne**\n    *   **Option B** uses H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate (Lindlar's catalyst). This catalyst reduces an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. So, 1-cyclohexylpropyne becomes *cis*-1-cyclohexylpropene (*cis*-C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃).\n    *   **Option D** uses Li/liq. NH₃, which reduces an alkyne to a *trans*-alkene.\n    *   **Option C** uses H₂/Pd, which would reduce the alkyne completely to an alkane (propylcyclohexane), a relatively unreactive compound that cannot lead to the target aldehyde. This makes option C incorrect.\n\n*   **Step 3: Cleavage of the Double Bond**\n    *   **Option B** uses O₃ followed by (CH₃)₂S (dimethyl sulfide). This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. It cleaves the double bond and forms two carbonyl compounds. Cleavage of *cis*-1-cyclohexylpropene (C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃) yields cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁-CHO) and acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO). This successfully generates the necessary precursor for the final step.\n    *   **Option D** uses O₃ followed by H₂O (oxidative workup). This would oxidize the resulting aldehydes to carboxylic acids, yielding cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and acetic acid. This does not produce the required aldehyde precursor, so option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Condensation**\n    *   **Option B** uses Ba(OH)₂, a strong base. In the mixture of aldehydes from the previous step, this base will catalyze an aldol condensation. While several products are possible (self-condensations and crossed-condensations), the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde leads to the target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Although the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde can be sterically hindered, this sequence is the only one provided that generates the correct precursor and uses a reagent capable of catalyzing the final C-C bond formation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the steps, we can eliminate the other options:\n*   **A** is incorrect because of the incompatible reagents in the first step.\n*   **C** is incorrect because the hydrogenation in step 2 creates a saturated alkane.\n*   **D** is incorrect because the oxidative ozonolysis in step 3 produces carboxylic acids instead of aldehydes.\n\n**Option B** provides a chemically sound (though potentially low-yield) pathway:\n1.  **Alkylation** to lengthen the carbon chain.\n2.  **cis-Reduction** to form an alkene.\n3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis** to cleave the alkene, yielding the key precursor, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n4.  **Base-catalyzed aldol condensation** to form the final product.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n<<<B>>>"
