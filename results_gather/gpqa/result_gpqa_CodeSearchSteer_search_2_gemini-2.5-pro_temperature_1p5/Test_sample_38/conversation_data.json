    "To find the numerical value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition of the wave function in quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle anywhere it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nThe probability is found by integrating the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², over the entire space where the particle can be found.\n\n1.  **Define the wave function and the region of existence:**\n    The wave function is given as ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i.\n    The problem states that the particles are only found between x = 1 and x = 3.\n\n2.  **Calculate the modulus squared of the wave function:**\n    The wave function is a complex number. The modulus squared, |ψ(x)|², is the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts.\n    *   Real part: Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n    *   Imaginary part: Im(ψ) = -0.5\n    So, |ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n3.  **Set up the normalization integral:**\n    The total probability is the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x = 1 to x = 3, which must equal 1.\n    ∫₁³ [a² / (1 + x) + 0.25] dx = 1\n\n4.  **Solve the integral:**\n    We integrate the expression with respect to x:\n    ∫ [a² / (1 + x) + 0.25] dx = a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x\n\n    Now, we evaluate this definite integral from 1 to 3:\n    [a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n    = [a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25]\n    = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B), this simplifies to:\n    = a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n    = a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\n5.  **Solve for \"a\":**\n    We set the result of the integral to 1:\n    a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\n    From scientific sources, the value of the natural logarithm of 2, ln(2), is approximately 0.6931.\n    a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\n    a² ≈ 0.7214\n    a ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\n    a ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
