    "### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two interconvertible structural isomers. In the context of keto-enol tautomerism, a compound must typically possess an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) to undergo this process.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In the structure of p-benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. The other four carbons in the ring are sp2 hybridized (part of a double bond) and do not have alpha-hydrogens in the traditional sense required for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has CH2 groups at positions 2, 4, and 6. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens to the adjacent carbonyl groups. This allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes the carbon a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism, existing as L and D enantiomers.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the formula CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. It does not contain any chiral centers. Due to the presence of a center of inversion, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.\n*   (B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
