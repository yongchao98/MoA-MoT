    "### Analysis of the Quantum State\n\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific eigenvalues for the z-component of the orbital angular momentum of two electrons. The initial state of the two-electron system is a coupled angular momentum state.\n\nThe key principles to solve this problem are:\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** When angular momenta are combined, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n2.  **State Decomposition:** A coupled angular momentum state can be expressed as a linear combination of uncoupled states. The coefficients in this expansion are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n3.  **Probability in Quantum Mechanics:** The probability of measuring a system to be in a particular state is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude (or coefficient) of that state in the system's wavefunction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Numbers:**\n    *   The two electrons are in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n    *   The coupled state of the system is given as `|l, m> = |2, -1>`, where `l=2` is the total angular momentum quantum number and `m=-1` is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Define the Measurement:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n    *   We are interested in the probability of finding the eigenvalue of `L₁z` to be `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L₂z` to be `-ħ`. These eigenvalues correspond to the magnetic quantum numbers `m₁ = -1` for the first electron and `m₂ = -1` for the second electron.\n\n3.  **Apply the Selection Rule:**\n    *   A fundamental rule for the addition of angular momenta is that the magnetic quantum number of the total angular momentum (`m`) must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers (`m₁` and `m₂`). This is often expressed as `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n    *   In the state we want to measure, `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   The sum is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   The given total state of the system is `|l=2, m=-1>`, so the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    *   The state we are measuring (`m₁ = -1`, `m₂ = -1`) has a total magnetic quantum number of `m = -2`. However, the system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   The probability of measuring a particular outcome (`m₁`, `m₂`) is given by the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l₁, m₁, l₂, m₂ | l, m>`.\n    *   Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero unless the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is satisfied.\n    *   In this case, since `m₁ + m₂ = -2` and `m = -1`, the condition is not met.\n    *   Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>` is zero.\n    *   The joint probability is the square of this coefficient, which is `0² = 0`.\n\nThe state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of states where `m₁ + m₂ = -1`. Specifically, it is a combination of the states `|m₁=0, m₂=-1>` and `|m₁=-1, m₂=0>`. The state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>` is not a component of the initial state, and thus the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
