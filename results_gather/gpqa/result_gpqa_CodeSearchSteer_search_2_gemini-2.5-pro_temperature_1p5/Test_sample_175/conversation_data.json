    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Normalize the Initial State Vector\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The norm squared of the vector is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)\\*(-1) + (2)\\*(2) + (1)\\*(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalization constant is 1/√6. Therefore, the normalized state vector |ψ_norm⟩ is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n### 2. Find the Eigenvector for P = 0\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\nP = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0. We solve the equation P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩:\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]` * `[[x], [y], [z]]` = `[[0], [0], [0]]`\n\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  (1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0\n2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n\nChoosing z = 1, we get x = -1. So, the unnormalized eigenvector |p₀_unnormalized⟩ is:\n|p₀_unnormalized⟩ = `[[-1], [0], [1]]`\n\nNow, we normalize this eigenvector:\nNorm = √((-1)² + 0² + 1²) = √2\n\nThe normalized eigenvector |p₀⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue P=0 is:\n|p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[-1], [0], [1]]`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0\n\nThe probability of measuring the value 0 for the observable P is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the normalized state |ψ_norm⟩ onto the eigenvector |p₀⟩.\n\nProb(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\n⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]] * [(1/√6) * `[[-1],,]`]\n⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * [(-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1)]\n⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * (1 + 0 + 1) = 2/√12 = 2/(2√3) = 1/√3\n\nProb(P=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3\n\n### 4. State Collapse After Measurement\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector |p₀⟩. So, the new state of the system |ψ'⟩ is:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[-1], [0], [1]]`\n\n### 5. Find the Eigenvector for Q = -1\n\nThe operator Q is given by the matrix:\nQ = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nSince Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue Q = -1 is:\n|q₋₁⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`\n\n### 6. Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q in the new state |ψ'⟩. The probability of obtaining the result -1 is:\n\nProb(Q=-1) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²\n\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = * [(1/√2) * `[[-1],,]`]\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * [(0)(-1) + (0)(0) + (1)(1)]\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = 1/√2\n\nProb(Q=-1) = (1/√2)² = 1/2\n\n### 7. Calculate the Total Probability\n\nThe total probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in steps 3 and 6.\n\nTotal Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after measuring P=0)\nTotal Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
