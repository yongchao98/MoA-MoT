    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates the base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄). The presence of a benzene ring corresponds to four degrees of unsaturation.\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond adds one degree of unsaturation.\n3.  **¹H NMR Data Breakdown:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents in a 1,4 (para) arrangement would typically show two signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split into a doublet by its vinyl neighbor. The other vinyl proton is split by its vinyl neighbor (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group accounts for `C₃H₅`.\n    *   **Two -CH₃ signals:** One methyl group is from the propenyl substituent (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The second methyl group must be part of the ester, indicating a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`). A methyl ester group is consistent with the FTIR data and introduces another `-CH₃` group. The chemical shift for a methyl ester is typically around 3.7-4.1 ppm.\n    *   **No -CH₂ signals:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence, ruling out structures containing ethyl groups, propyl groups, or other moieties with methylene (`-CH₂`) protons.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound consists of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n*   A propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH₃` (C₃H₅).\n*   A methyl ester group, `-COOCH₃` (C₂H₃O₂).\n\nThe most likely structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the assembled parts:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from benzene) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from benzene) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from methyl ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. A search confirms that the common name for this compound is (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate and its molecular formula is indeed C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Evaluating the Options Using Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (ignoring halogens and including oxygen as neutral).\n\nThe proposed structure has a benzene ring (4 DoU), a C=C bond (1 DoU), and a C=O bond (1 DoU), for a total of **6 degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nLet's check the DoU for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. This is incorrect. Furthermore, to have 14 hydrogens, the propenyl group would need to be saturated to a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`), which would introduce two `-CH₂` signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n*   **B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. While the DoU matches, getting to C₁₂ and H₁₄ from the correct C₁₁H₁₂ structure would require adding a `-CH₂` group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n*   **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**. This matches the expected DoU and all the spectral data align perfectly with a structure corresponding to this formula.\n\n<<<D>>>"
