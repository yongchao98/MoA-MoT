    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe problem asks for the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions. The Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (a Michael donor) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor). The selection of the major product depends on factors like steric hindrance and the stability of intermediates and final products.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically bulky base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):**\n    The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. The ketone has two α-positions: C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position C2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The carbon at position C6 is tertiary and has one α-hydrogen.\n    Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, forming a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Conjugate Addition:**\n    The C6 of the enolate acts as the nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. Subsequent protonation yields the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    A new substituent, an `ethyl propanoate` chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`), is attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this new, more complex molecule according to IUPAC rules, the principal functional group dictates the base name. Here, the ester (`ethyl propanoate`) is named as the parent chain, and the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent.\n\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is at C1 of the cyclohexyl ring.\n    *   The carbonyl group of the ketone is at the adjacent C2 position. Thus, the substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   The original substituents on the ring are renumbered according to this new scheme:\n        *   The methyl group on the original C6 is now on C1 of the substituent ring (`1-methyl`).\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups on the original C2 are now on C3 of the substituent ring (`3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the systematic name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This rules out options A and B.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-hydrogens of nitroalkanes are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base/Solvent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water (H₂O).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nitronate (Michael Donor):**\n    The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion.\n\n3.  **Conjugate Addition:**\n    The α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C1 of the nitropropane and the C3 of the butenenitrile. The resulting intermediate is then protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    Let's trace the carbon backbone of the product:\n    *   From 1-nitropropane: `(NO₂)-CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   From but-2-enenitrile: `(CN)-CH₂-CH-(CH₃)`\n    *   Connecting these at the point of attack gives: `(CN)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    To name this compound, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the highest priority functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest chain has six carbons, including the nitrile carbon. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   This places a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This rules out the `butanenitrile` product listed in options A and C.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is correctly named `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is correctly named `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
