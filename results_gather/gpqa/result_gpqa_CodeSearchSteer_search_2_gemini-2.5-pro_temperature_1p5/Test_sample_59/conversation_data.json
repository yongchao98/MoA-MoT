    "To determine the time it will take for the 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Determine the Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud**\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. This means that from an observer's perspective on Earth, it would take light 163,000 years to travel this distance.\n\n**2. Calculate the Journey Time from Earth's Perspective**\n\nThe spacecraft is traveling at a constant speed of 0.99999987 *c*. To an observer on Earth, the time it would take for the spacecraft to reach Earth would be:\n\nTime = Distance / Velocity\nTime = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 *c*\nTime ≈ 163,000.21 years\n\n**3. Calculate the Time from the Astronaut's Perspective (Time Dilation)**\n\nDue to the effects of time dilation, as described by Einstein's theory of special relativity, time will pass differently for the astronaut moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light compared to a stationary observer on Earth. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nt' = t * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   t' is the time experienced by the astronaut.\n*   t is the time measured by the observer on Earth (163,000.21 years).\n*   v is the velocity of the spacecraft (0.99999987 *c*).\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor (the square root part of the equation):\n\n√(1 - (0.99999987*c*)²/c²) = √(1 - 0.99999987²) ≈ 0.0005099\n\nNow, we can calculate the time experienced by the astronaut:\n\nt' ≈ 163,000.21 years * 0.0005099\nt' ≈ 83.11 years\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the journey will take approximately 83 years from the astronaut's perspective. However, let's re-evaluate the calculation with more precision.\n\nA more precise calculation for the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)` and then `t' = t / γ` gives:\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.99999987²) ≈ 1961.16\nt' = 163000.21 / 1961.16 ≈ 83.11 years\n\nGiven the available options, 81 years is the closest approximation. Let's re-examine the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, as it can vary slightly in different sources. Some sources state the distance is around 160,000 light-years.\n\nLet's recalculate with a distance of 160,000 light-years:\n\nTime (Earth frame) ≈ 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987*c* ≈ 160,000.208 years\nt' ≈ 160,000.208 years * 0.0005099 ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThis value is much closer to 81 years. The astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifespan is 150 years. Therefore, they have 128 years of life remaining (150 - 22), which is more than enough time to complete the journey.\n\nTherefore, the approximate time for the astronaut to reach Earth is 81 years.\n\n<<<A>>>"
