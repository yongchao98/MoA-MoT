    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the luminosity ratio:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    This simplifies to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**:\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength (λ_rest_max) of its emitted light in its own rest frame:\n        T = b / λ_rest_max, where b is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_obs_max) is affected by the star's radial velocity (v). For a star moving away (receding), its light is redshifted:\n        λ_obs_max = λ_rest_max * (1 + v/c), where c is the speed of light.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂.\n    *   For **Star_1**: Its radial velocity is 0 km/s. Therefore, its observed wavelength is its rest wavelength: λ_obs_max₁ = λ_rest_max₁. Its temperature is T₁ = b / λ_rest_max₁.\n    *   For **Star_2**: Its radial velocity is v₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted. The rest wavelength is λ_rest_max₂ = λ_obs_max₂ / (1 + v₂/c). Its temperature is T₂ = b / λ_rest_max₂ = b * (1 + v₂/c) / λ_obs_max₂.\n    *   Since λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂, we find the relationship between the temperatures:\n        T₂ = T₁ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\n    Using the given values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The unused information about the stars' masses is extraneous to this calculation.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>"
