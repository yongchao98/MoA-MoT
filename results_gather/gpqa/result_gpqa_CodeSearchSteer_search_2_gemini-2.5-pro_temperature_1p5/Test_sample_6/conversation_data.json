    "The calculation performed seems correct and is confirmed by the physics principles of the Breit-Wheeler process. The threshold energy for pair production (e⁺e⁻) from a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) interacting with a low-energy photon (in this case, from the Cosmic Microwave Background, CMB) is determined by the condition that the center-of-mass energy must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair.\n\nThe key formula derived from the principles of special relativity for a head-on collision is:\nE_γ ≥ (m_e * c²)² / E_CMB\n\nWhere:\n*   **E_γ** is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   **m_e * c²** is the rest mass energy of an electron (or positron), which is approximately 0.511 MeV (or 5.11 x 10⁵ eV).\n*   **E_CMB** is the energy of the CMB photon, given as 10⁻³ eV.\n\nThe minimum energy for the gamma-ray (the threshold energy) occurs in a head-on collision, as this is the most efficient interaction.\n\nLet's recalculate using these values:\n*   E_γ = (5.11 x 10⁵ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\n*   E_γ = (26.11 x 10¹⁰ eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)\n*   E_γ = 26.11 x 10¹³ eV\n*   E_γ = 2.611 x 10¹⁴ eV\n\nTo compare this with the given options, we convert the energy from electronvolts (eV) to giga-electronvolts (GeV):\n*   1 GeV = 10⁹ eV\n*   E_γ = (2.611 x 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)\n*   E_γ ≈ 2.6 x 10⁵ GeV\n\nThis calculated value directly corresponds to option D. This process sets a limit on the distance very-high-energy gamma rays can travel through the universe before being absorbed by interacting with the CMB, a phenomenon known as the gamma-ray horizon. For gamma rays in the PeV range (1 PeV = 10¹⁵ eV = 10⁶ GeV), the attenuation length can become as short as a few kiloparsecs due to interactions with the CMB.\n\n<<<D>>>"
