    "To find the expectation value of the operator `10σz + 5σx`, we can follow these steps.\n\nFirst, let's define the given spin state and the operators.\n\nThe spin state of the particle is given by:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\nIn matrix representation, the spin-up `|↑⟩` and spin-down `|↓⟩` states are:\n`|↑⟩ = [[1], [0]]`\n`|↓⟩ = [[0], [1]]`\n\nSo, the state vector `|ψ⟩` is:\n`|ψ⟩ = [[0.5], [√3/2]]`\n\nThe Pauli matrices `σz` and `σx` are defined as:\n`σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n`σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe operator for which we need to find the expectation value is `O = 10σz + 5σx`.\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `O` for a state `|ψ⟩` is calculated as `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`. We can calculate the expectation value of `σz` and `σx` separately and then combine them.\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of `σz`:**\n`⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩`\nFirst, we apply `σz` to `|ψ⟩`:\n`σz|ψ⟩ = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[0.5], [√3/2]] = [[0.5], [-√3/2]]`\n\nNow, we compute the inner product `⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩`. The bra vector `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\n`⟨σz⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[0.5], [-√3/2]]`\n`⟨σz⟩ = (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of `σx`:**\n`⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩`\nFirst, we apply `σx` to `|ψ⟩`:\n`σx|ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [[0.5], [√3/2]] = [[√3/2], [0.5]]`\n\nNow, we compute the inner product `⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[√3/2], [0.5]]`\n`⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n**3. Combine the results:**\nThe expectation value of the full operator is `⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩`.\n`⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value. Using √3 ≈ 1.732:\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nWhen rounded to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
