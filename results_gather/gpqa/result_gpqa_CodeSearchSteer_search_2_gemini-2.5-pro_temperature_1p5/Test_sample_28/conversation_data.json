    "To identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to determine which change would most probably result in a non-functional protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\nThe beginning of the intact gene is:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence: Methionine (Start) - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine...\n\nHere is an analysis of each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `ATGTTTCTCGCT...` changes to `ATGTTCTACGCT...`. This corresponds to a change in the second codon from TTT to TTC and the third codon from CTC to TAC.\n    *   TTT and TTC both code for Phenylalanine, so the first change is a silent mutation.\n    *   CTC codes for Leucine, while TAC codes for Tyrosine. This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but there is no guarantee it will completely eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `ATGTTTCTCGCT...` changes to `ATGTTCTAAGCT...`. This corresponds to a change in the third codon from CTC to TAA.\n    *   TAA is a **stop codon** (also known as a nonsense codon).\n    *   This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the cell to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein would be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** Comparing the intact sequence to `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...` reveals a frameshift mutation. A `T` has been inserted after the second codon.\n    *   Intact frame: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n    *   Mutant frame: `ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG...`\n    *   This **frameshift mutation** alters the reading frame of the gene. All codons downstream of the insertion will be different, leading to a completely altered amino acid sequence and likely a premature stop codon, resulting in a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** Comparing the intact sequence `...GCT GGT ACT...` to the mutant `...GCT ACT TCT...` shows that the codon GGT appears to have been deleted. This is an in-frame deletion of a single amino acid (Glycine). While this could impact protein function, it is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth the nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and the frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to produce a non-functional protein. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein (the third amino acid position). This is the most direct and certain method among the choices to ensure the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
