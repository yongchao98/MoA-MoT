    "### Analysis of the Observations\n\nThe observations from both ¹H NMR spectroscopy and LC-MS point toward the presence of two distinct but closely related chemical species in the crude sample.\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:** The presence of two peaks for a single alpha-proton, which together integrate to the expected value of one proton, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that these environments are distinct enough to give separate peaks, yet similar enough to have close chemical shifts, suggests the two species are isomers. The roughly equal integrals imply that these isomers are present in a nearly 1:1 ratio.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) resolves two components of equal intensity, which confirms the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR. The mass spectrometry (MS) data is crucial: both components give the same mass spectrum, and this mass is consistent with the target molecule. This definitively proves the two species are isomers (they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass). This observation rules out contamination with a precursor (Option C), as a precursor would have a different molecular weight.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished by conventional NMR spectroscopy or separated by a standard (achiral) LC column. You would observe only a single set of peaks in the NMR and a single peak in the LC trace. This contradicts the experimental observations.\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a non-standard term and does not clearly describe a specific chemical outcome. If it implies a side product that is not an isomer of the target molecule, it would be ruled out by the mass spectrometry data, which shows both peaks have the mass of the expected product.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and, importantly, are distinct chemical entities.\n    *   **NMR Spectroscopy:** Diastereomers have different NMR spectra. Corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers are in chemically non-equivalent environments and are expected to have different chemical shifts, leading to separate peaks. This is perfectly consistent with observing two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can typically be separated by chromatography techniques like LC. Finding two separable peaks of identical mass is the expected result for a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n    There are two common ways a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers could have been formed during the chemical synthesis of a peptide. First, if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks was used as a racemic (1:1) mixture of its D and L forms, its incorporation into the peptide chain (which contains at least one other chiral center) would produce a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers. Second, the peptide may contain restricted rotation about an amide bond, leading to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers (rotamers). These rotamers are a form of diastereomer and are known to be distinguishable by NMR and separable by LC, particularly when a proline residue is involved, as the energy barrier to rotation is lower. The NMR spectrum of peptides with *cis/trans* isomers often shows two distinct sets of signals for the amino acids adjacent to the bond in question.\n\nGiven that the experimental data (two peaks in NMR, two separable peaks in LC with identical mass) is fully explained by the presence of diastereomers and contradicted by the other options, this is the most likely explanation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
