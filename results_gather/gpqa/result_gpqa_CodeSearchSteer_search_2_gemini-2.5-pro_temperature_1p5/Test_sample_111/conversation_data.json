    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Normalization of the State Vector |alpha>\n\nThe state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>. We can write this as:\n|alpha> = C * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]\n\nTo find the normalization constant C, we use the condition <alpha|alpha> = 1. The bra <alpha| is given by:\n<alpha| = C* * [<up| (1-i) + <down| (2+i)]\n\nNow, we compute the inner product:\n<alpha|alpha> = |C|² * [<up| (1-i) + <down| (2+i)] * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]\n<alpha|alpha> = |C|² * [(1-i)(1+i) <up|up> + (2+i)(2-i) <down|down>] (since <up|down> = <down|up> = 0)\n<alpha|alpha> = |C|² * [(1² - i²) + (2² - i²)]\n<alpha|alpha> = |C|² * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)] = |C|² * (2 + 5) = 7|C|²\n\nSetting <alpha|alpha> = 1, we get:\n7|C|² = 1  => |C|² = 1/7 => C = 1/√7 (choosing the real, positive root)\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n**|alpha> = (1/√7) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]**\n\nIn vector notation, where |up> = (1, 0) and |down> = (0, 1), the state is:\n**|alpha> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]**\n\n### 2. Finding Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of Operator A\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements Aij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. For a 2-level system, this gives the matrix:\n**A = (ħ/2) * [,]**\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (let's call them 'a'), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - aI) = 0:\ndet( [[-a, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -a]] ) = 0\n(-a)(-a) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = 0\na² - (ħ²/4) = 0\na² = ħ²/4 => **a = ± ħ/2**\n\nThe eigenvalues are **a₁ = +ħ/2** and **a₂ = -ħ/2**.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n\n*   **For a₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    (A - a₁I) |v₁> = 0\n    (ħ/2) * [[-1, 1], [1, -1]] * [[x], [y]] = 0\n    This gives the equation -x + y = 0, or x = y. The unnormalized eigenvector is.\n    Normalizing it: |v₁> = (1/√(1²+1²)) * = **(1/√2) *** = (1/√2)(|up> + |down>)\n\n*   **For a₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    (A - a₂I) |v₂> = 0\n    (ħ/2) * [,] * [[x], [y]] = 0\n    This gives the equation x + y = 0, or x = -y. The unnormalized eigenvector is [1, -1].\n    Normalizing it: |v₂> = (1/√(1²+(-1)²)) * [1, -1] = **(1/√2) * [1, -1]** = (1/√2)(|up> - |down>)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate |vᵢ> is given by P(vᵢ) = |<vᵢ|alpha>|².\n\n*   **Probability for eigenstate |v₁> (P₁):**\n    <v₁|alpha> = [(1/√2) * (1, 1)] * [(1/√7) * ( (1+i), (2-i) )]\n    <v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]\n    <v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14\n    P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ **0.643**\n\n*   **Probability for eigenstate |v₂> (P₂):**\n    <v₂|alpha> = [(1/√2) * (1, -1)] * [(1/√7) * ( (1+i), (2-i) )]\n    <v₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]\n    <v₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14\n    P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ **0.357**\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Finding the Average Value\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by <A> = <alpha|A|alpha>. A simpler method is to use the probabilities and eigenvalues:\n<A> = P₁*a₁ + P₂*a₂\n<A> = (9/14)*(+ħ/2) + (5/14)*(-ħ/2)\n<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5)\n<A> = 4ħ/28 = **ħ/7**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is ħ/7. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
