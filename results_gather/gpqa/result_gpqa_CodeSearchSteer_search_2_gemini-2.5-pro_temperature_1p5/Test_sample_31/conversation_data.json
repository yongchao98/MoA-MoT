    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total relativistic energy of a Lithium-6 ($^6$Li) nucleus moving at a speed of 0.96 times the speed of light (c). The nucleus in question, X, is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Since Lithium's atomic number is 3 (meaning it has 3 protons), a nucleus with 3 protons and 3 neutrons has a mass number of 6.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the rest mass ($m_0$) of the $^6$Li nucleus.**\n    The atomic mass of a $^6$Li atom is approximately 6.015122 atomic mass units (amu). An atomic mass unit is equivalent to 931.5 MeV/c². To find the mass of the nucleus, we must subtract the mass of the three electrons. However, in high-energy physics calculations, the electron mass is often negligible compared to the nucleon masses, or the atomic mass is used as a close approximation for the nuclear mass, as the binding energies of electrons are very small. Let's use the atomic mass and convert it to GeV/c² (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n    *   Rest Mass Energy ($m_0c^2$) = 6.015122 amu * 931.5 MeV/amu\n    *   Rest Mass Energy ($m_0c^2$) ≈ 5603.09 MeV ≈ 5.6031 GeV.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) for the given speed.**\n    The speed (v) is 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28\n    *   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n3.  **Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).**\n    The total energy is given by the formula E = γ * m₀c².\n    *   E = 3.5714 * 5.6031 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 20.0108 GeV\n\n    This calculated value is very close to one of the provided options.\n\n4.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated energy is approximately 20.011 GeV.\n    The options are:\n    A) 23.069 GeV\n    B) 21.419 GeV\n    C) 20.132 GeV\n    D) 18.475 GeV\n\n    The calculated value of 20.011 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV. The minor difference can be attributed to the precise values used for the atomic mass and the mass-energy conversion factor.\n\nLet's refine the calculation using slightly different standard values for constants: 1 amu = 931.494 MeV/c².\n\n*   Rest Mass Energy ($m_0c^2$) = 6.015122 amu * 931.494 MeV/amu ≈ 5602.92 MeV ≈ 5.6029 GeV.\n*   E = 3.5714 * 5.6029 GeV ≈ 20.0099 GeV.\n\nThis result is also extremely close to 20.132 GeV. Let's consider the possibility that the problem uses the sum of the masses of the constituent protons and neutrons, without accounting for nuclear binding energy.\n*   Mass of 3 protons = 3 * 1.007276 u = 3.021828 u\n*   Mass of 3 neutrons = 3 * 1.008665 u = 3.025995 u\n*   Total mass = 6.047823 u\n*   Rest Mass Energy = 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ 5633.54 MeV ≈ 5.6335 GeV\n*   Total Energy = 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV ≈ 20.119 GeV\n\nThis value (20.119 GeV) is even closer to option C. Therefore, the intended calculation likely uses the sum of the nucleon masses.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\nE = (1/√(1-0.96²)) * (3 * m_p + 3 * m_n) * c²\nE ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV\nE ≈ 20.119 GeV\n\nThis result strongly supports option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
