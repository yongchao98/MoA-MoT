    "To determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism, each molecule's structure must be analyzed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and thus optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound is a substituted biphenyl. In biphenyl derivatives, if the substituent groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are bulky enough, they will hinder free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can make the molecule chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry. In this specific molecule, the large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups in all four ortho positions prevent the rings from becoming coplanar, thus eliminating any plane of symmetry and making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this compound's structure is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom attached to four distinct groups is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and capable of existing as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule is not chiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. Although some highly substituted benzophenones can be made chiral, the parent benzophenone molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. Due to this trans configuration, the molecule possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<C>>>"
