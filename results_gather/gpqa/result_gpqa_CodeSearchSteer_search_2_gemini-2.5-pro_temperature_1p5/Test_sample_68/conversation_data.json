    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) that decays after traveling a certain distance in a bubble chamber. Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame is longer than its proper lifetime. We need to find the minimum resolution of the detector required to observe the tracks of at least 30% of these decays. To observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n\n2.  **Given Data:**\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$ ($\\tau_0$): $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Total energy of $X^0$ (E): 27 GeV\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$ ($m_0c^2$): 3.41 GeV\n    *   Percentage of decays to observe: $\\geq 30\\%$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the total energy and rest mass energy.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L) in the Lab Frame:**\n    The mean distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame is its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau = \\gamma\\tau_0$) multiplied by its velocity ($v$). A direct formula relates the decay length to the momentum ($p$).\n    First, calculate the particle's momentum ($p$):\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    The mean decay length is given by:\n    $L = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\times \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n    $L = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $L \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Determine the Required Resolution:**\n    Let the detector resolution be $x$. To observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than $x$. The fraction of particles that travel a distance of at least $x$ before decaying is given by the survival probability $P(\\text{distance} \\geq x) = e^{-x/L}$.\n    We require that at least 30% of the particles are observed, so:\n    $e^{-x/L} \\geq 0.30$\n\n    To find the minimum required resolution (which corresponds to the maximum allowable track length for the condition to hold), we solve for the equality:\n    $e^{-x/L} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{x}{L} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $x = -L \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n    $x \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    $x \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This calculated value is the maximum resolution the detector can have to observe at least 30% of the decays. A finer resolution (a smaller value) would allow observing more than 30%. The calculated result, $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is not an exact match to any of the options. However, option A is the closest in value. The slight discrepancy may arise from variations in the constants used or a minor imprecision in the problem statement's values. Among the choices provided, option A is the only one that is physically plausible.\n\nComparing our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOption A is the closest answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
