    "To solve this problem, we need to connect the number of stars (N) to distance (r), using parallax (plx) as an intermediary.\n\nFirst, let's establish the fundamental relationship between distance and parallax. The distance to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax angle. This can be expressed as:\n\n*   *r* ∝ 1/*plx*\n\nThis means that parallax is also inversely proportional to distance:\n\n*   *plx* ∝ 1/*r*\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars observed varies with parallax according to the following relation:\n\n*   N ∝ 1/*plx*⁵\n\nNow, we can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into this expression to find how the cumulative number of stars out to a certain distance, *N(r)*, changes with that distance:\n\n*   N(r) ∝ 1 / (1/*r*)⁵\n*   N(r) ∝ *r*⁵\n\nThis equation tells us that the total number of stars up to a distance *r* is proportional to *r*⁵. However, the question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* changes with distance. This quantity is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, dN/dr.\n\nTo find this, we can differentiate our expression for N(r) with respect to *r*:\n\n*   dN/dr ∝ d/dr (*r*⁵)\n*   dN/dr ∝ 5*r*⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies in proportion to *r*⁴.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) ~ r⁵\nB) ~ r³\nC) ~ r²\nD) ~ r⁴\n\nThe calculated relationship matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
