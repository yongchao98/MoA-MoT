    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are built from the Standard Model fields and must respect certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** The SMEFT is a quantum field theory designed to be consistent with special relativity. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Lorentz invariant. This means the laws of physics it describes are the same for all observers in inertial frames.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. As a local quantum field theory, SMEFT must be invariant under translations in space and time, in addition to being Lorentz-invariant. Numerous sources confirm that the SMEFT Lagrangian is constructed to obey Poincare symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry, the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P), is known to be violated in the Standard Model's weak interactions. SMEFT, as an extension of the Standard Model, not only incorporates this violation but also introduces many new potential sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental principle in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of C, P, and time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant local field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\nBased on these principles, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
