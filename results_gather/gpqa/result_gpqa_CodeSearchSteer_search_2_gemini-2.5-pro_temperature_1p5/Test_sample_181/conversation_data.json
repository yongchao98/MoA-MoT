    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of ideal conditions. Analyzing the options reveals the correct statement.\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The basic Mott-Gurney law is derived for a single-carrier device, where only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) contributes to the current.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis statement is correct. The derivation of the Mott-Gurney law makes several key assumptions:\n    1.  The device involves only a **single type of charge carrier**.\n    2.  The semiconductor or insulator is ideal and **trap-free** (not limited by traps or energetic disorder).\n    3.  The contacts are **Ohmic**, meaning they form no energy barrier to charge injection and can supply an unlimited number of carriers. This is equivalent to having no carrier injection barrier. A Schottky contact, which has a barrier, would violate this assumption.\n    4.  The current is dominated by the drift of carriers under the applied electric field, and the **diffusion current is considered negligible**.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The space-charge-limited current regime is, by definition, dominated by drift current. Negligible drift current would contradict the fundamental physics the model describes.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A Schottky contact is a rectifying contact that creates an energy barrier to injection. The Mott-Gurney law requires an Ohmic contact, which has no such barrier, to ensure the current is limited by the space charge in the bulk material rather than by the injection process at the contact.\n\n<<<B>>>"
