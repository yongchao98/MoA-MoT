    "This problem is an analogue of the comparison between different modes of nuclear double-beta decay. The characteristics of the energy spectrum of the emitted particles are determined by the number of particles in the final state.\n\n*   **Original Decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V**\n    This process is analogous to two-neutrino double beta decay (2νββ). In this decay, the released energy (the Q-value) is shared among the kinetic energies of the four light final-state particles (2E and 2V), as well as the small recoil energy of the two heavy B nucleons. Because the energy is distributed among multiple particles, the summed energy spectrum of the two E particles is continuous, ranging from zero up to an endpoint. The endpoint Q represents the maximum possible combined kinetic energy for the two E particles, which occurs when the two V particles carry away zero energy.\n\n*   **Variant Decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + M**\n    This process is analogous to Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay. Here, the two V particles are replaced by a single exotic, massless particle M. The final state now consists of three light particles (2E and M) and the two heavy B nucleons. Since there are still multiple (more than two) particles in the final state sharing the available energy, the total energy spectrum of the two E particles remains continuous. The shape of this continuous spectrum is different from the original decay because the phase space (the number of ways to distribute the energy and momentum) has changed.\n\n*   **Endpoint Comparison**\n    The total energy released in a nuclear decay, the Q-value, is determined by the difference in rest mass between the initial and final states: Q = (mass_initial - mass_final)c².\n    1.  **Original Decay Q-value:** The final state contains two V particles, which are analogous to neutrinos and have a small but non-zero mass (m_V > 0). The total kinetic energy available is Q₁ = (2mₐ - 2m₋ - 2mₑ - 2mᵥ)c².\n    2.  **Variant Decay Q-value:** The final state contains one massless particle M (m_M = 0). The total kinetic energy available is Q₂ = (2mₐ - 2m₋ - 2mₑ)c².\n\n    Comparing the two, Q₂ is greater than Q₁ because less rest mass is created in the final state of the variant decay (since 2mᵥ > m_M = 0). The endpoint of the E-particle energy spectrum corresponds to this total available kinetic energy. Therefore, the endpoint for the variant decay is higher than that of the original decay.\n\nBased on this analysis, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and its endpoint increases.\n\n<<<D>>>"
