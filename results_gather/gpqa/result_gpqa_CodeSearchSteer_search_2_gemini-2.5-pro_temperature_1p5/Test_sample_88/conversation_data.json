    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** Heated to 240°C with excess KOH. This is a fragmentation reaction, common for 1,3-disubstituted adamantanes under harsh basic or acidic conditions, leading to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   Formula must be C₁₀H₁₄O, based on the 14 protons seen in the ¹H NMR.\n    *   IR spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: A signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). The simple pattern of the spectrum (three signals: 2H, 10H, 2H) suggests a high degree of symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** The structure that fits all this data is **exo-7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core has 9 carbons. The methylene group (=CH₂) and the ketone (=O) bring the formula to C₁₀H₁₄O. This matches the proton count.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the ketone and the methylene group, which explains the simple NMR spectrum.\n    *   The two vinylic protons of the =CH₂ group account for the signal at 4.79 ppm.\n    *   The ketone in the six-membered ring is consistent with the 1720 cm⁻¹ IR absorption.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** The MPV reduction selectively reduces the ketone (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH), leaving the double bond untouched.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** **exo-7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup.\n*   **Transformation:** Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone (C=O). The rest of the molecule, including the alcohol group, remains unchanged.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** **3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3, 3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one, has a bicyclic structure with an alcohol group at position 3 and a ketone at position 7. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7.\n*   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** We need to identify the non-exchangeable proton (so not the O-H proton) with the highest chemical shift. Protons are deshielded by proximity to electronegative atoms or groups like oxygen.\n    *   The proton attached to the carbon bearing the alcohol group (H3) is directly bonded to a carbon attached to an oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (on C6 and C8) have typical shifts of 2.2-2.7 ppm.\n    *   Bridgehead protons (H1 and H5) are beta to the ketone and gamma to the alcohol, and would likely appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, **H3 is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton**.\n\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H3:**\n    *   H3 is a single proton on C3. To determine its splitting pattern, we must count its neighbors on adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups, so H3 has a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   The molecule is in a flattened chair-chair conformation. The protons on C2 and C4 can be distinguished as axial (ax) and equatorial (eq).\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry, the two axial protons (H2ax and H4ax) are chemically equivalent to each other.\n    *   Similarly, the two equatorial protons (H2eq and H4eq) are equivalent to each other.\n    *   H3 will couple to the two equivalent axial protons with one coupling constant (J_ax) and to the two equivalent equatorial protons with a different coupling constant (J_eq).\n    *   Coupling to two equivalent protons gives a triplet. Since H3 couples to two different sets of two equivalent protons, its signal will be split into a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
