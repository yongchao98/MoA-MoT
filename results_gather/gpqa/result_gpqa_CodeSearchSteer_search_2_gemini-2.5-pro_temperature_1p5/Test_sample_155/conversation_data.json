    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis two-step process results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene. The stereochemical rule for the anti-addition to a trans (E) alkene is that it forms a **meso** compound.\n\n1.  **(E)-oct-4-ene to epoxide:** The first step is the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. This is a syn-addition, creating a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Epoxide to diol:** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water is an anti-addition. The attack of water on either epoxide enantiomer from the side opposite the epoxide ring leads to the formation of a single, achiral meso-compound: **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound has a plane of symmetry and is therefore not optically active.\n\nSo, Reaction 1 yields one product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**. The stereochemical rule for the anti-addition to a cis (Z) alkene is that it forms a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n\n1.  **(Z)-oct-4-ene to epoxide:** The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene is a syn-addition that forms a cis-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetric, the resulting epoxide is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Epoxide to diol:** The acid-catalyzed anti-addition of water to the meso-epoxide results in the formation of a racemic mixture. Attack at one carbon gives (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at the other gives (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two products are enantiomers.\n\nSo, Reaction 2 yields a racemic mixture of two products: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture that is injected into the HPLC contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **A racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-diol is a diastereomer of both of the enantiomers from Reaction 2.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, like polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute at the same time, producing a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   The racemic pair from Reaction 2 will elute together as **one peak**.\n*   The meso-diol from Reaction 1 is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, eluting as a **separate peak**.\n*   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers. The enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n*   It will also separate the diastereomers.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction 2, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso-compound from Reaction 1 is achiral. It will not be resolved into multiple peaks and will elute as a **single peak**.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
