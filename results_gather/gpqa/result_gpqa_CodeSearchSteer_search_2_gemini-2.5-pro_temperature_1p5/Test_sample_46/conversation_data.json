    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H)/2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 11)/2 = 10/2 = 5. A value of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree of unsaturation), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of an **ester (C=O)**. This frequency is typical for an ester conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), causing it to be split into a triplet. This is the -CH3 part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3), resulting in a quartet. The significant downfield chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates this methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of the ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)** as part of the ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is characteristic of the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH2)** identified from the IR spectrum. The broadening is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The data points to a molecule containing a para-substituted benzene ring, a primary amine group (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). Assembling these fragments leads to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ester group is incorrect.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: The substitution pattern is meta, not para, and it's an amide, not an ethyl ester.\n*   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
