  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Single-Mutant Results\n\n*   **Wild-Type (Control):** 100% resistance.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This gene contributes to resistance, but its loss is not catastrophic.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This gene has a more significant role in resistance than G1.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This gene is absolutely essential for resistance. Its loss completely eliminates the plant's defense.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Double-Mutant Results for Epistasis\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene mutation masks the effect of another. To identify epistasis, we compare the phenotype of the double mutant with the phenotypes of the single mutants. If the double mutant's phenotype is identical to one of the single mutant's, that gene is considered epistatic to the other.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    *   This phenotype (0% resistance) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0%).\n    *   It is different from the `g1` mutant phenotype (75%).\n    *   Conclusion: The `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G1 and G2 function in the same biological pathway, with G2 acting downstream of G1, or G2's function being the ultimate limiting factor.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    *   This phenotype (0% resistance) is identical to the `g2` single mutant phenotype (0%).\n    *   It is different from the `g3` mutant phenotype (50%).\n    *   Conclusion: The `g2` mutation also masks the `g3` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This places G2's function as essential and downstream of G3's function in the same pathway, or otherwise overriding it.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n    *   This phenotype is not the same as the `g1` mutant (75%) or the `g3` mutant (50%).\n    *   In fact, the phenotype is much more severe than either single mutant alone. This indicates a **synergistic interaction**, where the combined effect of losing both genes is greater than the sum of their individual effects. This often happens when two genes act in parallel pathways that contribute to the same outcome. It rules out epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   *G2 is epistatic towards G1:* **TRUE**. As determined above.\n    *   *G1 is a transcription factor:* Plausible. The problem states at least one gene is an upstream transcription factor. Based on the epistasis analysis, G2 is the most downstream or overriding component, making it unlikely to be the *upstream* TF for the others. G1 could plausibly be a TF that regulates a parallel process.\n    *   *G2 and G3 show pleiotropy:* Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple distinct traits. The experiment only measures disease resistance, so we cannot confirm this from the data. However, this is the only option where the epistasis claim is correct.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* **FALSE**. The `g1g3` double mutant has a unique, more severe phenotype.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* **FALSE**.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* The synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` mutant is characteristic of genes that have some redundant or parallel function. However, the epistasis claim makes this option incorrect.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   *G3 is epistatic towards G1:* **FALSE**. The `g1g3` double mutant phenotype is not the same as the `g3` single mutant phenotype.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of epistasis, Option A is the only choice that contains a correct statement derived directly from the experimental data (`G2 is epistatic towards G1`). The other options contain epistasis claims that are demonstrably false. Therefore, A is the best possible conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>"
