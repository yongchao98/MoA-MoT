    "The impulse approximation is a simplifying assumption used in the study of interactions with complex systems like atomic nuclei. The core idea is to treat the interaction as a rapid event involving only one constituent of the system, with the other constituents acting as spectators. This approximation holds when the interaction time is very short compared to the characteristic time of the internal motions and interactions within the nucleus.\n\nThe assumptions that collectively imply the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is a fundamental tenet of the approximation, where the complex interaction with the entire nucleus is reduced to a sum of interactions with its individual nucleons. The probe is assumed to interact with only one nucleon at a time.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This means that neither the incoming probe nor the outgoing particle interacts with the other (A-1) nucleons of the nucleus. They are treated as spectators to the primary interaction.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** During the brief moment of the interaction, the forces binding the nucleon within the nucleus are considered negligible compared to the force of the interaction itself. The nucleon is treated as an independent particle.\n\nThe internal quark structure of the nucleon (statement 3) is a deeper level of description and is not a foundational assumption of the impulse approximation itself, which operates at the level of nucleons. Therefore, the correct set of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
