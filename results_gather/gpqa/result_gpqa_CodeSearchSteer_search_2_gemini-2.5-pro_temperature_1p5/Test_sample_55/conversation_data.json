    "To determine the correct transition route and its probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions, we must apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions and calculate the branching ratios.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the possible transitions based on selection rules\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Change in the principal quantum number, n: no restriction, but for decay, Δn < 0.\n*   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l: Δl = ±1.\n*   Change in the magnetic quantum number, m: Δm = 0, ±1.\n\n**First Transition: |3,0,0> → Intermediate State |n',l',m'>**\n\n*   The initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0>.\n*   According to the Δl = ±1 rule, since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   Since the decay must occur in two steps to reach n=1, and the principal quantum number must decrease, the intermediate state must have n'=2. Decay to n=1 with l=1 is impossible, as n=1 only allows for l=0.\n*   According to the Δm = 0, ±1 rule, since m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n**Second Transition: Intermediate State |2,1,m'> → Final State |1,0,0>**\n\n*   The initial states are |2,1,m'> and the final state is |1,0,0>.\n*   Let's check the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n    *   From |2,1,-1> to |1,0,0>: Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed); Δm = 0-(-1) = +1 (allowed). This is a valid transition path.\n    *   From |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>: Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed); Δm = 0-0 = 0 (allowed). This is a valid transition path.\n    *   From |2,1,1> to |1,0,0>: Δl = 0-1 = -1 (allowed); Δm = 0-1 = -1 (allowed). This is a valid transition path.\n\nAll three transition routes proposed in options A, B, and C are physically possible.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of each transition route\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition step. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, the three intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are degenerate.\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole moment matrix element, |<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>|². For a transition from an unpolarized l=0 state to the three different m' substates of an l=1 level, the transition probabilities are equal. This can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are found to be equal.\n\nTherefore, the atom in the |3,0,0> state has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three |2,1,m'> states.\n*   Total probability of decaying from |3,0,0> to the l=1 level is 1.\n*   Since there are three equally probable final m' states, the probability for each is:\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\nOnce the atom reaches any of the |2,1,m'> states, it is certain to decay to the |1,0,0> state, as this is the only lower-energy state accessible via an electric dipole transition. Thus, the probability of the second step, P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>), is 1.\n\nThe overall probability for each specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n*   Route via |2,1,-1>: P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n*   Route via |2,1,0>: P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n*   Route via |2,1,1>: P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\n### Step 3: Compare with the given options\n\n*   A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}  -> Incorrect probability.\n*   B) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}  -> **Correct route and probability.**\n*   C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}  -> Incorrect probability.\n*   D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}  -> Incorrect probability.\n\nThus, option B correctly identifies a possible route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>"
