    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Write the balanced chemical equation**\n\nIron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, is a solid base that reacts with a strong acid (represented by H⁺) in a neutralization reaction to dissolve. The products are the iron(III) ion, Fe³⁺, and water.\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar mass of Iron (Fe) = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1.008 g/mol\n\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNext, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ using its given mass (0.1 g).\nMoles = Mass / Molar Mass\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**3. Calculate the required volume of the strong acid**\n\nFrom the balanced equation, the stoichiometry shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\nThe problem states we are using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, which means its concentration of H⁺ is 0.1 mol/L. We can now find the minimum volume of this acid needed.\n*   Volume = Moles / Concentration\n*   Volume of acid = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n\nTo convert the volume to cm³, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 L = 1000 cm³).\n*   Volume of acid = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³\n\nThis value is very close to the 28.05 cm³ listed in option D.\n\n**4. Calculate the pH of the resulting solution**\n\nAfter the Fe(OH)₃ has been completely dissolved by the acid, the resulting solution contains Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The Fe³⁺ ion (specifically the hexaaquairon(III) ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺) hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak acid and releasing H⁺ ions, which determines the pH of the solution.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\nFe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\nFirst, calculate the initial concentration of Fe³⁺ in the 100 cm³ solution.\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume\n*   [Fe³⁺] = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\nNext, we use the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the Fe³⁺(aq) ion. The literature value for Ka at 25°C is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻³.\n\nWe set up an equilibrium expression:\nKa = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n\nLet 'x' be the change in concentration at equilibrium.\n6.3 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (9.357 x 10⁻³ - x)\n\nBecause the Ka value is relatively large compared to the initial concentration, we must solve the full quadratic equation:\nx² = 6.3 x 10⁻³ * (9.357 x 10⁻³ - x)\nx² + (6.3 x 10⁻³)x - 5.895 x 10⁻⁵ = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)] / 2a:\nx = [-(6.3 x 10⁻³) ± √((6.3 x 10⁻³)² - 4(1)(-5.895 x 10⁻⁵))] / 2\nx = [-0.0063 ± √(3.969 x 10⁻⁵ + 2.358 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.0063 ± √(2.755 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.0063 ± 0.0166] / 2\n\nSince concentration (x) must be positive, we take the positive root:\nx = (0.0103) / 2 = 0.00515 M\n\nThis value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of H⁺ ions.\n[H⁺] = 5.15 x 10⁻³ M\n\nFinally, we calculate the pH:\npH = -log₁₀[H⁺]\npH = -log₁₀(5.15 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.29\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nOur calculated values are:\n*   Volume of acid ≈ 28.07 cm³\n*   pH ≈ 2.29\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nB) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nC) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nD) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is an excellent match for the volume in option D (28.05 cm³). The calculated pH (2.29) is different from the pH in option D (2.04), which suggests a possible discrepancy in the problem's provided pH value or the specific Ka value intended for use. However, the volume calculation is based on fundamental stoichiometry and is highly reliable. Therefore, option D is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
