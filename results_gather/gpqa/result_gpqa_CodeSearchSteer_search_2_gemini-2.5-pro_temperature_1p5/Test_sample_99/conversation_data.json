    "Here is a breakdown of the reaction sequence and an evaluation of each statement:\n\n*   **Compound A (C3H6) + Br2/CCl4 → Compound B:** Compound A is propene (CH3–CH=CH2). It undergoes an addition reaction with bromine (Br2) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) to form 1,2-dibromopropane.\n    *   **A:** Propene (C3H6)\n    *   **B:** 1,2-dibromopropane (CH3CH(Br)CH2Br)\n\n*   **Compound B + alcoholic KOH → Compound C:** Compound B undergoes dehydrohalogenation (removal of HBr) with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base, to form an alkyne.\n    *   **C:** Propyne (CH3–C≡CH)\n\n*   **Compound C passed through red-hot iron tube → Compound D:** Propyne undergoes cyclic polymerization (trimerization) when passed through a red-hot iron tube to form an aromatic compound.\n    *   **D:** 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)\n\n*   **Compound D + mixture of two strong acids → Compound E:** Mesitylene undergoes nitration with a nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO3 and concentrated H2SO4). The three methyl groups direct the incoming nitro group (-NO2) to an available ortho/para position.\n    *   **E:** 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene\n\n*   **Compound E + Fe/HCl → Compound F:** The nitro group in compound E is reduced to an amino group (-NH2) using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid.\n    *   **F:** 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesidine)\n\n*   **Compound F + Nitrous Acid → Compound G:** The primary aromatic amine (F) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, formed from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperatures) to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **G:** 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt\n\n*   **Compound G + NaOH → Compound H:** The diazonium salt (G) is hydrolyzed with a base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH), typically upon warming, to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a phenol.\n    *   **H:** 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (Mesitol)\n\nNow let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n**A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The standard test for phenols with neutral ferric chloride (FeCl3) solution typically produces a violet, green, or blue color due to the formation of a colored complex. While some sterically hindered phenols may not give a color, a yellow color is not the characteristic positive result; in fact, FeCl3 solution is itself yellow-orange. Some studies show that 2,4,6-trimethylphenol can be oxidized by Fe(III) complexes, but a simple yellow color as a characteristic test result is not expected. This makes the statement likely incorrect.\n\n**B) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne. Propyne has a boiling point of -23.1 °C and is a colorless, highly flammable gas. It is used as a specialty fuel, which underscores its flammability. This statement is correct.\n\n**C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and do not split each other, resulting in one singlet signal. Similarly, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are also equivalent and produce a second singlet signal. Therefore, its ¹H NMR spectrum shows two singlets. This statement is correct.\n\n**D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are widely used as precursors for dyes, particularly azo dyes, through diazotization and coupling reactions. 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is specifically used to produce dyes like Acid Blue 129. This statement is correct.\n\nThe incorrect statement is A, as the characteristic ferric chloride test for phenols does not typically yield a yellow color.\n\n<<<A>>>"
