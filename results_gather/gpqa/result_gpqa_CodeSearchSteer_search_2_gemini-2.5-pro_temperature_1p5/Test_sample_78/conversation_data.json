    "### Analysis of the Reaction and Product\n\n1.  **Product Structure Determination from NMR Data:**\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon. The signals between δ 126.9 and 144.1 ppm are in the aromatic/alkene region. The signals at δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm correspond to aliphatic carbons, likely methyl groups.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl singlets (δ 2.28 and 2.31), indicating two CH₃ groups not adjacent to protons. The pattern of two doublets integrating to two protons each (δ 7.08 and 7.71) is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The remaining two doublets at δ 6.75 and 7.68 ppm, each integrating to one proton, are characteristic of two vinyl protons on a double bond coupled only to each other.\n    *   **Assembling the Product:** Based on this data, the product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with a para-substituted phenyl ring. The structure is **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. This structure accounts for all NMR signals: a methyl ketone singlet (~2.3 ppm), a methyl group on the aromatic ring (~2.3 ppm), two doublets for the p-substituted ring, and two doublets for the trans-vinylic protons. The molecular formula for this product is C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches Compound X.\n\n2.  **Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   The reaction uses 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, at an elevated temperature (403 K or 130 °C). These conditions are suitable for rearrangement reactions.\n    *   The transformation of an epoxide to a ketone is known as the Meinwald rearrangement. Studies have shown that DABCO can effectively catalyze the Meinwald rearrangement of terminal epoxides, including 2-alkenyl and 2-aryl epoxides, into methyl ketones.\n\n3.  **Identification of Compound X:**\n    *   The product, (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, contains a **4-methylphenyl** (or *p*-tolyl) group.\n    *   We must find the reactant from the given options that also contains this specific structural feature, as the carbon skeleton is largely conserved in this type of rearrangement.\n    *   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Contains a *phenyl* group, not a 4-methylphenyl group.\n    *   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. This contains the required **4-methylphenyl** group. The molecular formula of this compound is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n    *   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Contains a *styryl* group (`C₆H₅-CH=CH-`), which has a phenyl group, not a 4-methylphenyl group.\n    *   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** Contains a *styryl* group, which has a phenyl group, not a 4-methylphenyl group.\n\nBased on the conservation of the 4-methylphenyl group from reactant to product, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The reaction is a DABCO-catalyzed isomerization of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
