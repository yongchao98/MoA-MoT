    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine which planet has the higher transit probability.\n\n### 1. Understanding Transit Probability\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital semi-major axis. This assumes the planet's orbit is randomly oriented from our point of view. For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius (`a`).\n\nThe formula is:\n*   `p_transit = R_star / a`\n\nWhere:\n*   `p_transit` is the transit probability.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the host star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Ratio\n\nWe want to compare the transit probability of Planet 1 (`p_transit1`) with that of Planet 2 (`p_transit2`).\n\n*   For Planet 1: `p_transit1 = R_star1 / a1`\n*   For Planet 2: `p_transit2 = R_star2 / a2`\n\nThe problem states that both host stars have the same radii, so `R_star1 = R_star2`. Therefore, the ratio of the probabilities is:\n\n`p_transit1 / p_transit2 = (R_star1 / a1) / (R_star2 / a2) = a2 / a1`\n\nTo find which planet is more likely to transit and by how much, we need to calculate the ratio of their semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n### 3. Applying Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). The law also incorporates the mass of the host star (`M_star`). The general form can be written as:\n\n`a³ ∝ P² * M_star`\n\nFrom this, we can express the semi-major axis `a` as:\n\n`a ∝ (P² * M_star)^(1/3)`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio `a2 / a1` using the information provided:\n\n*   The orbital period of Planet 1 is three times shorter than Planet 2: `P2 = 3 * P1`.\n*   The mass of the star hosting Planet 1 is twice that of the star hosting Planet 2: `M_star1 = 2 * M_star2`.\n\nLet's set up the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n\n`a2 / a1 = [ (P2² * M_star2) / (P1² * M_star1) ]^(1/3)`\n\nSubstitute the known relationships into the equation:\n\n`a2 / a1 = [ ((3*P1)² * M_star2) / (P1² * (2*M_star2)) ]^(1/3)`\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n`a2 / a1 = [ (9 * P1² * M_star2) / (2 * P1² * M_star2) ]^(1/3)`\n\nThe terms `P1²` and `M_star2` cancel out, leaving:\n\n`a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n\n`a2 / a1 ≈ 1.65096`\n\nSince the probability ratio `p_transit1 / p_transit2` is equal to `a2 / a1`, we have:\n\n`p_transit1 / p_transit2 ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis result shows that the probability of Planet 1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet 2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet 1.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\n\n**D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**\n\n<<<D>>>"
