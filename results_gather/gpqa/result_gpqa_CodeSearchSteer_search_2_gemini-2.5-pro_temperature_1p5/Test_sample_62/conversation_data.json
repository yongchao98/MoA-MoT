    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to calculate its energy. The energy of the photon must equal the energy difference between the initial and final states of the molecule.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible vibrational and rotational quantum numbers: `v=0` and `J=0`.\n*   **Final State:** The question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". In a rovibrational model, transitions are governed by selection rules. For an absorbed photon, the vibrational quantum number must change by `Δv = +1`. The rotational quantum number must change by `ΔJ = ±1`. Starting from `J=0`, the only possibility is `ΔJ = +1`. Therefore, the final state is `v=1`, `J=1`. This is the lowest energy rovibrational transition allowed from the ground state.\n\n### 2. Energy Calculation\n\nThe energy of a state in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by:\n\n*   `E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J(J+1)`\n    *   `v` = vibrational quantum number\n    *   `J` = rotational quantum number\n    *   `ħ` = reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n    *   `ω` = angular frequency of vibration (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s)\n    *   `B` = rotational constant\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`ΔE`) is the difference between the final and initial state energies:\n\n*   `E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω`\n*   `E_final = E(1, 1) = (3/2)ħω + B*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n*   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ( (3/2)ħω + 2B ) - ( (1/2)ħω ) = ħω + 2B`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Rotational Constant (B)\n\nThe rotational constant `B` depends on the molecule's moment of inertia (`I`): `B = ħ² / (2I)`. The moment of inertia depends on the reduced mass (`μ`) and the bond length (`R`): `I = μR²`.\n\n*   **Calculate the reduced mass (μ):**\n    *   Mx = 20 amu\n    *   My = 2 amu\n    *   1 amu = 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n    *   `μ = 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n*   **Calculate the moment of inertia (I):**\n    *   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   `I = μR² = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n*   **Calculate B:**\n    *   `ħ = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n    *   `B = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.599 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Photon Energy (ΔE)\n\nNow substitute the values for `ħω` and `B` into the energy difference equation:\n\n*   `ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n*   `2B = 2 * (4.599 x 10⁻²³ J) = 9.198 x 10⁻²³ J`\n*   `ΔE = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 9.198 x 10⁻²³ J ≈ 4.2161 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n    (Note: The rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy.)\n\n### 5. Calculate Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe momentum of a photon (`p`) is related to its energy (`E`) and the speed of light (`c`) by the formula `p = E/c`.\n\n*   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   `p = ΔE / c = (4.2161 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
