    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the velocity of particle A.\n\n**1. Initial State and Energy Conservation**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). \"Slowly moving\" implies we can neglect the antiproton's kinetic energy. We assume the proton is at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.\n\n*   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n*   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n*   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThis initial energy is conserved and converted into the final state particles.\n\n**2. Final State**\n\nThe annihilation produces four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. The problem states that the rest energy of each particle A ($m_A c^2$) is 300 MeV.\n\nDue to the conservation of energy and momentum, the total final energy ($E_{final}$) is distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n\n*   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$, where $E_A$ is the total energy of a single particle A.\n\n**3. Calculating the Energy of Particle A**\n\nBy the principle of energy conservation, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n\n*   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n*   $E_A = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nSo, each particle A has a total energy of 469 MeV.\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity of Particle A**\n\nThe total energy ($E_A$) of a relativistic particle is given by the equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   We know $E_A = 469 \\text{ MeV}$ and $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   $469 \\text{ MeV} = \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{469}{300} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nNow we can solve for the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n*   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n*   $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n*   $\\beta \\approx 0.7687$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
