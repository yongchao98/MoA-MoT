    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a type of chemical reaction known as a Cope rearrangement. This reaction is a-sigmatropic rearrangement that occurs in 1,5-dienes, which are molecules containing two double bonds separated by three single bonds.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: The initial molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure is `CH3-CH=CH-CH2-CH(C4H9)-CH=CH-CH2-CH3`. The core part of the molecule that will react is the 1,5-diene system, which consists of carbons 2 through 7 (`-CH=CH-CH2-CH(Butyl)-CH=CH-`).\n\n2.  **The Cope Rearrangement**: When heated, the molecule arranges into a cyclic, chair-like transition state. In this state, the sigma bond between carbon-4 and carbon-5 breaks, while a new sigma bond forms between carbon-2 and carbon-7. Simultaneously, the double bonds shift from C2=C3 and C6=C7 to C3=C4 and C5=C6.\n\n3.  **Product Formation**: This rearrangement of bonds results in a new molecule with a different carbon skeleton. The substituents (the methyl group on C2, the ethyl group on C7, and the butyl group on C5) remain attached to their respective carbon atoms during the shift. The resulting product's structure is `CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH-(CH2CH2CH2CH3)`.\n\n4.  **IUPAC Naming**: To name the product, we must first identify the longest continuous carbon chain that contains both double bonds.\n    *   The longest such chain has 10 carbon atoms, making the parent name \"deca-\".\n    *   Numbering the chain from the end that gives the double bonds the lowest possible numbers, we start from the `CH2=` end. This places the double bonds at positions 1 and 5, leading to the name \"deca-1,5-diene\".\n    *   The substituents are an ethyl group on carbon 4 and a methyl group on carbon 3.\n    *   Arranging the substituents alphabetically gives the final name: 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecule formed is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
