    "The problem asks for the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same photometric signal as the rotational modulation of a star with spots on one hemisphere. To solve this, the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the starspots needs to be calculated and then equated to the signal produced by a planetary transit.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Brightness Variation from Starspots\n\nThe brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing its unspotted hemisphere and its spotted hemisphere to the observer. The flux (F) from a surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴, where T is the effective temperature. We can model the observed flux based on the hemisphere facing the observer.\n\n1.  **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The observed flux is proportional to the effective temperature of the star (T_eff) raised to the fourth power.\n    *   `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`\n\n2.  **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the hemisphere with starspots faces the observer. This hemisphere's surface is a mix of the normal photosphere and cooler spots. The spots cover 20% of this hemisphere (filling factor, `f = 0.2`).\n    *   The temperature of the spots (T_spot) is 1000 K cooler than the star's effective temperature: `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is the weighted average of the flux from the unspotted portion (80%) and the spotted portion (20%).\n    *   `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\n3.  **Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude of the rotational modulation is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness.\n    *   `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for flux:\n        `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    *   Simplifying the equation gives:\n        `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   `f = 0.2`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n`Amplitude = 0.2 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`Amplitude = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`Amplitude = 0.2 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`\n`Amplitude = 0.2 * (671 / 1296)`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035`\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by approximately 10.35% due to the spots.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Signal to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nThe problem asks for the radius of a planet (`R_pl`) that would produce this same signal amplitude if it were transiting an otherwise unspotted star. A transiting exoplanet blocks a portion of the star's light, and the depth of this transit signal is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's disk area.\n\n*   `Transit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n*   `Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### Step 3: Equate the Signals and Solve\n\nTo find the relative radius of the planet (`R_pl / R_star`), we set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude of the starspot modulation.\n\n*   `(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`\n*   `(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.1035`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = √0.1035`\n*   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217`\n\nThis result indicates that the hypothetical exoplanet would need a radius of about 0.32 times the radius of its host star to produce a transit with the same depth as the rotational brightness variation caused by the spots.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.3217 is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
