    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the major isomer of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene heated with maleic anhydride (1:1 ratio) → Product 1**\n\nThis reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Cyclooctatetraene (COT) itself is non-planar and exists in a tub conformation. However, it is in equilibrium with a small amount of its planar, bicyclic valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This bicyclic isomer readily reacts as a diene with a dienophile like maleic anhydride. The reaction is stereospecific, and the major product is the *endo* adduct, which is kinetically favored due to secondary orbital interactions.\n\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is *endo*-tricyclo[4.2.2.0<sup>2,5</sup>]deca-3,9-diene-7,8-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with methanol and sulfuric acid → Product 2**\n\nThis is a Fischer esterification reaction. The sulfuric acid catalyzes the opening of the anhydride ring by two molecules of methanol. This converts the anhydride group into two methyl ester (COOCH₃) groups. The stereochemistry of the tricyclic framework remains unchanged.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is dimethyl *endo*-tricyclo[4.2.2.0<sup>2,5</sup>]deca-3,9-diene-7,8-dicarboxylate. This chemical is also available commercially.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 heated with cyclopentadiene → Product 3**\n\nThis is a second Diels-Alder reaction. In this step, the double bond in the six-membered ring of Product 2 (at the 9-position) acts as the dienophile, and cyclopentadiene acts as the diene.\n\nTo determine the major isomer of Product 3, we must consider the stereochemistry of the approach of the cyclopentadiene to the dienophile (Product 2).\n\n*   **Facial Selectivity:** The dienophile is part of a complex, bridged ring system. The cyclopentadiene will approach from the less sterically hindered face. The cyclobutene ring fused on the opposite side of the dienophile's bridge presents significant steric hindrance. Therefore, the cyclopentadiene will approach from the *syn* face, the same side as the existing one-carbon ethano-bridge.\n*   ***Endo* Rule:** In a Diels-Alder reaction, the *endo* product is generally the kinetically favored major product. This means the developing double bond of the diene (cyclopentadiene) aligns underneath the dienophile. In this case, the *endo* approach of cyclopentadiene to the *syn* face of the dienophile results in a specific stereochemistry.\n\nCombining these stereochemical preferences, the major isomer of Product 3 will have the following features:\n*   The cyclopentadiene adds to the *syn* face of the norbornene-like double bond of Product 2.\n*   The addition follows the *endo* rule, leading to the thermodynamically less stable but kinetically favored product.\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n\nBy carefully analyzing the stereochemical descriptors and SMILES strings, we can determine which option corresponds to the major product described above. The *endo* addition of cyclopentadiene to the *syn* face of Product 2 results in the stereochemistry described in option A. The name precisely reflects this stereochemical arrangement.\n\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The correct structure is dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5S,8R,8aS,8bR,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate.\n\nThe corresponding SMILES string is: `O=C(OC)[C@H]1[C@@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@@H]4[C@H]3[C@@H]5C=C[C@H]4C5)[C@@H]2[C@H]1C(OC)=O`.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
