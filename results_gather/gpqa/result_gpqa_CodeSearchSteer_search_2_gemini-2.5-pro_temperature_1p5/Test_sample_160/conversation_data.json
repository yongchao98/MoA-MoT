    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scenario to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. Its general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of the target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ).\n\n*   **λ ≈ 1 / (n * σ)**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze λ1 (MFP of Gas-Gas Collisions)\n\nλ1 represents the mean free path of the remaining gas molecules colliding with each other. In this case, both the projectile molecule and the target molecules are in random motion. The kinetic theory of gases accounts for this by introducing a factor of the square root of 2 in the denominator to correctly represent the average relative velocity between molecules.\n\n*   **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)**\n    *   **n:** The number density of gas molecules.\n    *   **σ_gas:** The collision cross-section for two gas molecules, which is related to their physical diameter (d) by σ_gas = πd².\n\n### Step 3: Analyze λ2 (MFP of Electron-Gas Collisions)\n\nλ2 represents the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the beam as they travel through the same gas. In this situation:\n*   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they travel at very high speeds, close to the speed of light.\n*   The residual gas molecules, in comparison, are virtually stationary.\n*   Because the target gas molecules are not moving significantly relative to the incident electrons, the √2 factor is not used in the formula.\n\n*   **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_electron)**\n    *   **n:** The same number density of gas molecules.\n    *   **σ_electron:** The scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n### Step 4: Compare λ1 and λ2\n\nTo find the relationship between λ2 and λ1, we can take their ratio:\n\n**λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_electron)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)]**\n\n**λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gas) / σ_electron**\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n**λ2 = λ1 * √2 * (σ_gas / σ_electron)**\n\nSince √2 ≈ 1.414, we have:\n\n**λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1 * (σ_gas / σ_electron)**\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gas vs. σ_electron)\n\nThe final step is to compare the gas-gas collision cross-section (σ_gas) with the electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_electron).\n\n*   **σ_gas:** This represents the effective area for a physical collision between two molecules and is based on their diameters.\n*   **σ_electron:** This represents the effective area for an electron to be significantly scattered by a gas molecule. A high-energy electron is a tiny, point-like particle. It can often pass through the electron cloud of an atom with little interaction, only scattering significantly if it passes very close to the nucleus or an orbital electron. Therefore, the effective target area it \"sees\" is considerably smaller than the physical cross-section that one gas molecule presents to another.\n\nThus, it is physically certain that **σ_gas > σ_electron**, which means the ratio **(σ_gas / σ_electron) > 1**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSubstituting this back into our relationship:\n\n**λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1 * (a value greater than 1)**\n\nThis definitively means that **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\nReviewing the given options:\n*   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation -> Incorrect.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> Incorrect, as λ2 must be greater than 1.414 * λ1.\n*   C) λ2 < λ1 -> Incorrect.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> **Correct**. This inequality is satisfied because our derived relationship shows that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1, and specifically greater than 1.414 * λ1.\n\nThe observation is not a discrepancy; it is an expected outcome based on the physics of particle collisions. The mean free path for a high-energy electron in a gas (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ1) due to both the stationary nature of the target molecules relative to the electron and the smaller scattering cross-section of the electron-gas interaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
