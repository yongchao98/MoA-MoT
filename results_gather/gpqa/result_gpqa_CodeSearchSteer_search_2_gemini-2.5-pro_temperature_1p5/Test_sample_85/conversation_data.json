    "To determine the correct starting materials, A and B, we must analyze the reactants and products of both reactions. Both reactions result in a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The key lies in the selectivity of the two different reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The proposed starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This name suggests a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one carboxylic acid has been converted to an isobutyl ester. This structure possesses two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu). It also has a single chiral center at the carbon with the ethyl group.\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is a six-membered lactone, which is formed from the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the functional groups (the acid and the ester), not at the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the ethyl-bearing carbon is retained throughout the reaction. An (R)-configured starting material will produce an (R)-configured product, and an (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is not reduced.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is unreacted (or exists as its lithium salt).\n    2.  Acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate to form 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  This hydroxy acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to form the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product has the (R) configuration and the stereocenter is not altered, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group is unaffected.\n    2.  The resulting molecule is a hydroxy-ester.\n    3.  This intermediate cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification (catalyzed by the acidic workup), eliminating isobutanol to form the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product has the (S) configuration and the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis, A is the (R)-isomer and B is the (S)-isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
