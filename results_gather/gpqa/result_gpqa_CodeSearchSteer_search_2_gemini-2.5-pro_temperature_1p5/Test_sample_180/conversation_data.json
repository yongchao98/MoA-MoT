    "To determine the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes, we need to understand which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how the hypothetical cessation of the pp-III branch affects them.\n\n### Analysis of Solar Neutrino Sources\n\nThe Sun's energy, and its neutrino emissions, primarily come from the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III). Each branch and specific reaction within it produces neutrinos with a characteristic energy spectrum.\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Neutrinos in this energy range are almost exclusively produced by the continuous spectrum of the Boron-8 (⁸B) decay. This decay is the final step of the **pp-III branch**.\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band contains two primary sources of neutrinos:\n    1.  A contribution from the continuous spectrum of the same Boron-8 (⁸B) decay that populates Band 1.\n    2.  A very strong, mono-energetic \"line\" of neutrinos at **861 keV** (0.861 MeV) from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be). This reaction is part of the **pp-II branch**.\n\n### Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch\n\nThe hypothetical scenario states that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. The neutrinos from this event would be observable on Earth about 8.5 minutes later, which corresponds to the time given in the problem.\n\n1.  **Effect on Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Since the sole significant source of neutrinos in this band is the Boron-8 decay from the pp-III branch, stopping this branch will cause the neutrino flux in this band to drop to essentially zero.\n\n2.  **Effect on Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The pp-III branch stopping will eliminate the continuous background of Boron-8 neutrinos in this band as well. However, the prominent 861 keV neutrino line from the Beryllium-7 decay will remain because it is part of the pp-II branch, which the problem states continues to function normally. This ⁷Be neutrino flux is substantial.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nAfter the pp-III branch has stopped:\n*   **Flux (band 1)** becomes approximately **0**.\n*   **Flux (band 2)** remains a significant, non-zero value due to the ⁷Be neutrinos.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n\nFlux (band 1) / Flux (band 2)  ≈  0 / (significant non-zero flux)  ≈  0\n\nLooking at the provided options:\nA) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nB) 1\nC) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\nD) 10\n\nThe value closest to zero is 0.01.\n\n<<<A>>>"
