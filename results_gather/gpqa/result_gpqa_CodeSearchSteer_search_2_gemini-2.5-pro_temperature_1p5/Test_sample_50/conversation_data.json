    "The theoretical derivation I performed resulted in `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n1.  **Identify the system:** A point charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (`d > R`). The sphere being \"grounded\" means its potential is held at V=0.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** To solve this problem, we can use the method of images. The effect of the induced charge on the grounded sphere can be replaced by an \"image charge,\" `q'`, located inside the sphere. This replacement is valid for calculating the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere.\n    *   The image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   It is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    An important point, often a source of confusion, is whether the potential energy is simply the interaction energy of the charge `q` and the image `q'`. It is not. A common formula for the energy of a charge distribution is `U = (1/2) * Î£(q_i * V_i)`, where `V_i` is the potential at charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n\n    In our system (the real charge `q` and the grounded sphere), the sphere has a potential of `V_sphere = 0`. So, the only contribution to the energy formula comes from the point charge `q`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n    *   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n4.  **Potential at `q`:** The potential at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) due to the induced charges is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n    *   The potential at `q` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n        `V_at_q = -k * qR / d * (1 / ((d^2 - R^2)/d))`\n        `V_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Calculation:** Now, substitute this potential back into the energy formula.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` perfectly matches option D. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises from considering that the potential energy is the work done on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity, not the simple interaction energy of `q` and `q'`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
