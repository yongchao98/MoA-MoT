    "### Summary of Findings\n\n1.  **ESPRESSO Limiting Magnitude (1-UT Mode):**\n    The user is asking about ESPRESSO coupled with *one* of the 8m VLT telescopes (1-UT mode). The question asks for a signal-to-noise (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour (3600s) exposure.\n    *   One source includes a performance plot for ESPRESSO in singleHR mode (1-UT). Looking at the plot for an exposure time of 3600s (red curve, left panel), a S/N of 10 is achieved for a star with an apparent V magnitude of approximately 17.0.\n    *   Another source states that in 1-UT mode, an S/N of 10 is obtained with 3 exposures of 20 minutes (totaling 1 hour) on a V = 17.1 magnitude star. This corroborates the previous finding.\n    *   Therefore, the limiting magnitude for detectability under the specified conditions is **V ≈ 17.1**.\n\n2.  **Observability from Paranal:**\n    *   The Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees.\n    *   A star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC). Stars with a very high positive declination are not visible from the Southern Hemisphere. A common rule of thumb is that for a latitude `L`, an object is unobservable if its declination `δ > 90 + L`. For Paranal at -24.6°, this means stars with DEC > 65.4° are not observable.\n\n3.  **Star-by-Star Analysis:**\n\n    *   **a) Canopus:**\n        *   **Apparent Magnitude:** -0.74. This is extremely bright.\n        *   **Declination:** -52° 41′ 44.3810″.\n        *   **Observability:** The declination of -52.7° is easily visible from Paranal's latitude of -24.6°.\n        *   **Detectability:** Its magnitude of -0.74 is much brighter than the limit of 17.1. **Detectable.**\n\n    *   **b) Polaris:**\n        *   **Apparent Magnitude:** Fluctuates around 1.98.\n        *   **Declination:** +89° 15′ 50.8″.\n        *   **Observability:** The declination of +89.26° is far too north to be seen from Paranal's southern latitude (-24.6°). It is well above the horizon limit. **Not Observable, therefore Not Detectable.**\n\n    *   **c) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance.**\n        *   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** Using the formula `m = M - 5 + 5*log10(d)`:\n            `m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) = 10 + 5 * 1 = 15.0`.\n        *   **Declination:** 0°. This is on the celestial equator and is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n        *   **Detectability:** V = 15.0 is brighter than the limit of 17.1. **Detectable.**\n\n    *   **d) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance.**\n        *   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n            `m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(200) = 10 + 5 * 2.301 = 10 + 11.505 = 21.5`.\n        *   **Declination:** 0°. Observable.\n        *   **Detectability:** V = 21.5 is much fainter than the limit of 17.1. **Not Detectable.**\n\n    *   **e) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance.**\n        *   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n            `m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) = 10 + 5 * 0.699 = 10 + 3.495 = 13.5`.\n        *   **Declination:** 0°. Observable.\n        *   **Detectability:** V = 13.5 is brighter than the limit of 17.1. **Detectable.**\n\n    *   **f) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance.**\n        *   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n            `m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(50) = 10 + 5 * 1.699 = 10 + 8.495 = 18.5`.\n        *   **Declination:** 0°. Observable.\n        *   **Detectability:** V = 18.5 is fainter than the limit of 17.1. **Not Detectable.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLet's tally the detectable stars:\n*   a) Canopus: **Yes**\n*   b) Polaris: **No** (not observable)\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Yes** (V=15.0)\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **No** (V=21.5)\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Yes** (V=13.5)\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **No** (V=18.5)\n\nThere are three detectable stars in the list. This corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check of the steps.\n1. ESPRESSO 1-UT limiting magnitude for S/N=10 in 1 hour is V~17.1. Confirmed.\n2. Calculate apparent magnitudes.\n   - c: M=15, d=10 -> m=15. Correct.\n   - d: M=15, d=200 -> m=21.5. Correct.\n   - e: M=15, d=5 -> m=13.5. Correct.\n   - f: M=15, d=50 -> m=18.5. Correct.\n3.

Visible from Paranal. Yes.\n4. Compare magnitudes for observable stars.\n   - Canopus: V=-0.74 < 17.1. Detectable.\n   - Polaris: Not observable.\n   - Star c: V=15.0 < 17.1. Detectable.\n   - Star d: V=21.5 > 17.1. Not detectable.\n   - Star e: V=13.5 < 17.1. Detectable.\n   - Star f: V=18.5 > 17.1. Not detectable.\n\nThe count is 3: Canopus, Star c (10 pc), and Star e (5 pc). The correct option is B.\n\nFinal answer appears solid. I am ready to write the response.\nTo answer the question, we must evaluate each star based on two criteria:\n1.  **Observability:** The star must be visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile, which is in the Southern Hemisphere.\n2.  **Detectability:** The star's apparent brightness must be sufficient for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, coupled with a single 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT), to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in one hour.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude**\nThe ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single VLT Unit Telescope (1-UT mode) can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 in a one-hour exposure for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of about 17.1. A chart showing the instrument's performance confirms that for a 3600-second (1-hour) exposure, a S/N of 10 is reached for a star with V ≈ 17. Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude of 17.1 or brighter (i.e., a smaller magnitude number) will be considered detectable.\n\n### **Step 2: Assess Each Star**\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 42'. Since the Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of about -24.6°, Canopus is easily observable from this location.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of Canopus is -0.74, making it the second brightest star in the night sky. This is significantly brighter than the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Observability:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of about +89° 16'. It is located very close to the north celestial pole and is therefore not visible from the southern latitude of the Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Polaris is **not detectable** because it is not observable.\n\n**c) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15 at 10 pc**\n*   **Observability:** With a declination of 0°, this star lies on the celestial equator and is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** We calculate its apparent magnitude (m) using the distance modulus formula: m = M - 5 + 5·log₁₀(d).\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5·log₁₀(10) = 10 + 5·(1) = 15.0\n    An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15 at 200 pc**\n*   **Observability:** With a declination of 0°, this star is observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** We calculate its apparent magnitude:\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5·log₁₀(200) ≈ 10 + 5·(2.301) ≈ 10 + 11.5 = 21.5\n    An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15 at 5 pc**\n*   **Observability:** With a declination of 0°, this star is observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** We calculate its apparent magnitude:\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5·log₁₀(5) ≈ 10 + 5·(0.699) ≈ 10 + 3.5 = 13.5\n    An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15 at 50 pc**\n*   **Observability:** With a declination of 0°, this star is observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** We calculate its apparent magnitude:\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5·log₁₀(50) ≈ 10 + 5·(1.699) ≈ 10 + 8.5 = 18.5\n    An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\n### **Final Count**\nThe stars from the list that would be detectable by ESPRESSO under the given conditions are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star c (at 10 pc)\n3.  Star e (at 5 pc)\n\nIn total, **3** stars are detectable.\n\n<<<B>>>"
