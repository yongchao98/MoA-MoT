    "The formation of a shmoo in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is a response to a mating pheromone that signals the cell to prepare for mating. This process involves a halt in the cell cycle and a significant change in gene expression to facilitate polarized growth toward a potential mate. When analyzing the proteome of active chromatin during this phase, one would expect to find an abundance of protein complexes involved in active gene transcription.\n\nThe key cellular events during shmoo formation are:\n*   **Cell Cycle Arrest**: The cell cycle stops in the G1 phase. This prevents the cell from entering the S phase (DNA synthesis) and dividing.\n*   **Active Transcription**: A new transcriptional program is activated to produce the proteins necessary for shmoo growth and cell fusion.\n\nGiven this context, let's evaluate the protein complexes listed:\n*   **A) Enhancer protein complex**: Enhancers and the proteins that bind to them are crucial for boosting the transcription of specific genes. As the shmoo response requires robust expression of mating-specific genes, these complexes would be abundant in active chromatin.\n*   **B) Nucleosome histone complex**: Nucleosomes, composed of histones, are the fundamental building blocks of all chromatin, both active and inactive. In regions of active transcription, histones are present but often carry modifications that facilitate gene expression. Any analysis of chromatin will invariably recover a large number of histone complexes.\n*   **D) Pre-initiation complex (PIC)**: This large complex, which includes RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors, assembles at gene promoters to start transcription. Since shmoo formation is driven by active gene expression, PICs would be highly prevalent on the active chromatin of relevant genes.\n\n*   **C) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC)**: The pre-RC assembles on origins of replication during the G1 phase to \"license\" the DNA for the next round of replication. While shmoo-forming cells are arrested in G1, and therefore have pre-RCs assembled on their chromatin, the process of DNA replication itself is inhibited. The cellular machinery is geared towards transcription for mating, not DNA synthesis for division. An assay targeting the proteome of *transcriptionally active* chromatin would primarily recover complexes involved in that process. Since the function of the pre-RC (initiating replication) is dormant and not part of the active transcriptional program, it would be the least observed complex in an assay focused on active chromatin regions driving the shmoo phenotype.\n\n<<<C>>>"
