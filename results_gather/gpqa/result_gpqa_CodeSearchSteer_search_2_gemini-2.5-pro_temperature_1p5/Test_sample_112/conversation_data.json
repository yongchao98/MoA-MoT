    "Based on the spectroscopic data provided, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is identified by analyzing the functional groups indicated by each technique.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Coupled with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid, which typically shows a C=O stretch between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n### Deduction of the Chemical Formula:\n\nThe combined data indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This requires the presence of at least two oxygen atoms (from the -COOH group) and a minimum of two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on their degree of unsaturation (DoU):\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** The DoU is calculated as `6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2`. This formula accommodates two degrees of unsaturation and has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid. This is consistent with all the spectroscopic data. An example of such a compound is 4-hexenoic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** The DoU is 1. This is inconsistent with the presence of both a carbonyl group and a C=C double bond. It also has only one oxygen, ruling out a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** The DoU is 1. While it has two oxygens, it can only have one double bond (or a ring), which contradicts the evidence for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** The DoU is 2. This fits the required degrees of unsaturation, but with only one oxygen atom, it cannot be a carboxylic acid, which is strongly indicated by the broad O-H peak and the m/z = 45 fragment.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the analytical data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
