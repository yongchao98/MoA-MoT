    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. The energy of the system is given by the equation E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2^3 = 8 possible configurations.\n\nFirst, we will list all 8 possible spin configurations and calculate the corresponding energy for each state. The product SiSj will be +1 if the spins are aligned and -1 if they are anti-aligned.\n\nThe possible spin configurations (S1, S2, S3) and their energies are:\n*   **All spins up:** (+1, +1, +1)\n    *   E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n*   **All spins down:** (-1, -1, -1)\n    *   E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThese two states have an energy of -3J.\n\nNext, we consider the states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two:\n*   **One spin down:**\n    *   (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n*   **One spin up:**\n    *   (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n\nThese six states each have an energy of J.\n\nNow, we can identify the energy levels and their degeneracies (the number of states with the same energy):\n*   Energy level E1 = -3J has a degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   Energy level E2 = J has a degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states. It can be calculated by summing over the energy levels, taking into account their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
