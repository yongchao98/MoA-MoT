    "To identify the problem with the protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed in the context of translation.\n\nThe plus strand of the DNA is read by the transcriptional machinery to produce a messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated by the ribosome into a protein. The ribosome reads the mRNA in groups of three nucleotides, called codons, starting at a \"start\" codon and ending at a \"stop\" codon.\n\nThe provided DNA sequence is:\n5'-**ATG**TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC**AAATGA**CTCTGGAAGAAG...TGA-3'\n\n1.  **Start Codon**: The sequence correctly begins with `ATG`, which is transcribed into the mRNA start codon `AUG`, coding for methionine. This initiates the protein translation.\n2.  **Antigenic Determinant (HA Tag)**: The sequence following the start codon is `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`.\n    *   `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`\n    *   This translates to the amino acid sequence: Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartic acid-Valine-Proline-Aspartic acid-Tyrosine-Alanine (YPYDVPDYA). This is the correct sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. Therefore, there is no missense mutation in the tag sequence.\n3.  **Codon Analysis After the Tag**: The sequence immediately following the HA tag is `AAATGA`.\n    *   The ribosome reads this as two codons: `AAA` and `TGA`.\n    *   `AAA` codes for the amino acid Lysine.\n    *   `TGA` corresponds to the mRNA codon `UGA`. In the standard genetic code, `UGA` is a stop codon, also known as an opal or umber codon.\n4.  **Consequence**: The presence of the `TGA` codon causes the ribosome to halt protein synthesis immediately after the Lysine residue is added. The process terminates, and the incomplete, very short peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K) is released. This premature termination prevents the synthesis of the full-length GADD45G protein, explaining the experimental failure.\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: While linkers can sometimes help with protein folding and stability, the primary issue here is the failure to synthesize the full protein, not its subsequent degradation.\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: The premature stop codon is `TGA`, not `TAA` (UAA in mRNA). Furthermore, the initial experiment is in Chinese hamster ovary cells, not a mouse. Most importantly, stop codons do not have corresponding tRNAs; they are recognized by release factors that terminate translation.\n*   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: This is the direct consequence of the premature `TGA` stop codon in the engineered sequence.\n*   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: The translation of the HA tag sequence shows it is correct.\n\nThe correct reason for the failure to express the protein is the early termination of translation by the ribosome.\n\n<<<C>>>"
