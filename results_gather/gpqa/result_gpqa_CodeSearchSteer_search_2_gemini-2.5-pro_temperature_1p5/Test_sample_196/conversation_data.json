    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\nThe provided Infrared (IR) spectrum data gives us the first clues about the functional groups present in compound X.\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which, in combination with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can confidently conclude that compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) data allows us to determine the precise structure of the molecule.\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very deshielded, broad singlet corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This supports the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring.\n*   **The Alkyl Chain Signals:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for a single proton, suggesting a CH group connected to several other protons.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, likely a CH₂ group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, which must be a CH₃ group next to a CH group.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, which must be a CH₃ group next to a CH₂ group.\n\nAssembling these alkyl fragments leads to a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This structure perfectly matches the splitting patterns and integrations observed.\n\nCombining all the spectral information, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 3: The Chemical Reaction**\n\nCompound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is well-established that red P and HI will reduce a carboxylic acid group completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\nThe carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to the benzene ring is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring itself are unaffected by these reagents.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 4: Matching with Options**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect structure.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product from the reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
