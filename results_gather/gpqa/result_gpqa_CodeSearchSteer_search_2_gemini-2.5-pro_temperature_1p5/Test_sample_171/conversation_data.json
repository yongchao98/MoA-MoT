    "My derivation was correct. The search results confirm that the Boltzmann equation is the correct tool to use for relating atomic excitation to temperature in a stellar photosphere under LTE. The equation is given as N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (kT)). My step-by-step derivation based on the ratio of this equation for two different stars is sound. The key step is recognizing that the given energy difference, ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J, is numerically equal to the standard value of the Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. This implies that the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1, which simplifies the final expression. This kind of setup is common in physics problems to make the final answer tidy and dependent only on the variables of interest.\n\nFinal check of the derivation:\n1.  Ratio for star 1: (N₂/N₁)_₁ = C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)]\n2.  Ratio for star 2: (N₂/N₁)_₂ = C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]\n    (where C = g₂/g₁)\n3.  Given: (N₂/N₁)_₁ = 2 * (N₂/N₁)_₂\n4.  Substitute: C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]\n5.  Cancel C: exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]\n6.  Take natural log: -ΔE / (kT₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (kT₂)\n7.  Rearrange: ln(2) = ΔE / (kT₂) - ΔE / (kT₁)\n8.  Factor out ΔE/k: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [1/T₂ - 1/T₁]\n9.  Simplify the fraction: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)]\n10. Given ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J and knowing k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K, we have ΔE/k ≈ 1.\n11. Final equation: ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂) ]\n\nThis matches option B. The physics is consistent: for the excitation to be higher in star_1, it must be hotter, so T₁ > T₂, making the right side of the equation positive, which matches the left side, ln(2).\n\nThe relationship between spectral features and temperature is well-established. Higher temperatures lead to more energetic collisions, which can excite atoms to higher energy levels. The Boltzmann equation quantitatively describes this relationship between the population of energy levels and temperature.\n\nTherefore, the derivation is sound and confirmed by fundamental principles of stellar atmospheres.\n\nThe correct equation is ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]. This corresponds to option B.\n<<<B>>>"
