    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity-addition formula.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Speed of light in the glass (rest frame of the glass):** The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index 'n' is `c/n`. Since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, the speed of the light beam relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n2.  **Velocity of the glass:** The glass (the moving frame of reference) is traveling at a velocity `v` relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:** The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object relative to the stationary observer.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in the moving frame.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the stationary observer.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Applying the values to the formula:** We substitute the known values into the equation:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    This gives:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplifying the expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To remove the fractions within the expression, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
