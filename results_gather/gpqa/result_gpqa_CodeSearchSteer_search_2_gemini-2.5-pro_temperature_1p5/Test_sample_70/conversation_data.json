    "The calculation I performed seems correct based on the fundamental principles of planetary physics.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** The search results confirm that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This is stated as P² ∝ a³. For the circular orbits mentioned in the problem, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance.\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it radiated energy as a black body, balancing the incoming energy from its star. The formula shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (T_eq ∝ 1/√a).\n\nThe derivation steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate Temperature and Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the semi-major axis (a):\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance and Period:** From Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis (a) is proportional to the orbital period (P) to the power of 2/3:\n    *   P² ∝ a³  =>  a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Combine the relationships:** Substitute the relationship for 'a' into the temperature proportionality:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Now, we can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 4 (T_eq4) and Planet 2 (T_eq2) using their orbital periods (P4 and P2).\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Use the given period ratios:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5.\n    *   The period for Planet 2 (P2) corresponds to the value 2.\n    *   The period for Planet 4 (P4) corresponds to the value 3.5.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio P2 / P4 is 2 / 3.5, which simplifies to 4 / 7.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n    *   (4 / 7) ≈ 0.5714\n    *   (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.83\nB) ~0.75\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.69\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
