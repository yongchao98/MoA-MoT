    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we must first understand the starting material and the nature of the chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its Structure\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohexene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid group** (-COOH).\n*   **Formyl group** (-CHO), which is an aldehyde.\n*   **Vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂), which contains a double bond.\n\nThe structure consists of:\n*   10 Carbon atoms (C₁₀)\n*   12 Hydrogen atoms (H₁₂)\n*   3 Oxygen atoms (O₃)\n\nThe molecular formula is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Its effects on the functional groups present in the starting molecule are as follows:\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids completely to alkanes (R-COOH → R-CH₃).\n*   It reduces aldehydes completely to alkanes (R-CHO → R-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (C=C → C-C).\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nApplying these reductions to the starting material:\n*   The carboxylic acid group becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group becomes a methyl group.\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is saturated.\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated, converting it to an ethyl group.\n\nThe original cyclohexane ring structure remains, but all double bonds and oxygen-containing groups are removed. The final product is a saturated substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane (the exact numbering can vary with IUPAC nomenclature, but the molecular formula is key).\n\nThe product has 10 carbon atoms (no carbons are lost). Since it's a saturated cycloalkane, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) indicates the total number of rings and π (pi) bonds in a molecule.\n\nThe formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + 1\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring of the cyclohexane structure. All other forms of unsaturation (the three double bonds) have been removed by the reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
