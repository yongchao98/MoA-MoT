    "The reaction described is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative and can result in two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃). Its high symmetry results in a single proton signal (~7 ppm) and two carbon signals (~137 ppm for the alkene carbons and ~165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons), which matches the problem description.\n    *   **Diene:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄).\n    *   **Product:** The molecular formula of the adduct is C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n2.  **Major and Minor Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction typically favors the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions (Alder's Endo Rule).\n    *   However, when significant steric hindrance is present, the *exo* product, which is thermodynamically more stable, can become the major product. The diene used here has four methyl groups, two of which are at the reacting bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). These methyl groups create substantial steric repulsion in the more compact *endo* transition state.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Proton NMR Signals and Structure:**\n    *   The problem describes four key sets of protons in the products:\n        *   A 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm): These are the four methyl groups attached to the double bond (Me(alkene)). Their chemical shift is in the typical range for vinylic methyls.\n        *   A 6H singlet (~1 ppm): These are the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (Me(BH)). They are more shielded and thus appear at a higher field (lower ppm).\n        *   A 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm): These are the two equivalent protons on the succinic anhydride part of the molecule (H(anhydride)). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   A 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm): This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7). Bridge protons typically appear in this region, and the coupling arises from geminal interaction with the other bridge proton.\n\n4.  **NOESY Analysis:**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5Å). We need to find a proton-proton interaction that exists in the major (*exo*) product but not in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   **In the major (*exo*) adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented *exo* (away from the C7 bridge). This places the anhydride protons (H(anhydride)) in an *endo* position, pointing \"under\" the main ring system and towards the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the *endo*-oriented H(anhydride) protons are very close in space to the *anti*-proton of the C7 bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak between these two groups is expected.\n    *   **In the minor (*endo*) adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented *endo* (towards the C7 bridge). This places the anhydride protons (H(anhydride)) in an *exo* position, pointing away from the C7 bridge. The distance between the H(anhydride) and the bridge protons is large, so the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) and absent in the minor product (*endo*) connects the anhydride protons with one of the bridge protons.\n    *   Based on the chemical shifts provided in the options, this corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H(anhydride)) and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge).\n\nTherefore, the two resonances connected by the differentiating cross-peak are the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<D>>>"
