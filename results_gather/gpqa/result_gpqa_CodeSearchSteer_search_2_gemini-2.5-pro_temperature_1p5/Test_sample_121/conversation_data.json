    "The solution involves a four-step chemical synthesis followed by an analysis of the final product's nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum. Here is a breakdown of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final answer.\n\n### Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Bromoacetic Acid**\n    Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine. This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which results in the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid group). The product is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Ethyl Bromoacetate**\n    Product 1, bromoacetic acid, is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ester. The product is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Ethyl Cyanoacetate**\n    Product 2, ethyl bromoacetate, is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction. This yields product 3, ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of the Final Product (Cyclization)**\n    Product 3, ethyl cyanoacetate, is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a multi-step process within a single reaction vessel:\n    *   First, the sodium hydride removes an acidic alpha-hydrogen from ethyl cyanoacetate, creating a stabilized carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule, displacing a bromine atom in a nucleophilic substitution reaction (alkylation).\n    *   Because excess sodium hydride is used, the remaining acidic alpha-hydrogen on the newly formed intermediate is also removed, creating a second carbanion.\n    *   This second carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This final step creates a six-membered ring.\n    The final product, compound 4, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product, we must analyze its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule has no plane of symmetry. This lack of symmetry has significant consequences for the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group:** The ethyl group consists of a methylene (-CH₂) and a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n        1.  The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and produce one signal.\n        2.  The two protons of the methylene group are also equivalent (due to rapid rotation) and produce a second signal.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:** Due to the absence of symmetry, all five of the other carbon atoms in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are chemically distinct from one another. Furthermore, on each of these carbons, the two attached hydrogen atoms (one axial and one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic, meaning they are in chemically non-equivalent environments.\n        *   C2 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C3 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C4 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C5 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n        *   C6 protons: 2 distinct signals (axial and equatorial)\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   Ethyl group signals: 2\n    *   Cyclohexane ring signals: 10 (2 for each of the 5 methylene carbons)\n    *   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 10 = 12**\n\nEach of these 12 sets of protons is chemically unique and will therefore produce a distinct signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
