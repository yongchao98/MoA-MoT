    "The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate (Gilman reagent) is a well-established method for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which has specific consequences for the regioselectivity and stereochemistry of the product.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reactants:**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` part of the name indicates a cyclohexane ring fused to a three-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (an epoxide). The oxygen is designated as position 7, and it bridges carbons 1 and 6. There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4, with the specified R/S configurations.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, or lithium dimethylcuprate. This Gilman reagent provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity of the Reaction:**\nOrganocuprates are considered soft nucleophiles. In reactions with asymmetric epoxides under basic or neutral conditions, they attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   In the given substrate, the epoxide ring is formed by C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C2, C5, and O7).\n*   Carbon C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a hydrogen atom, and O7).\n*   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the methyl nucleophile from the Gilman reagent will attack at this position.\n\n**3. Stereochemistry of the Reaction:**\nThe reaction proceeds via a backside S_N2 attack. A key characteristic of the S_N2 mechanism is the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom where the substitution occurs.\n*   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6 from the side opposite to the C6-O bond.\n*   This causes the C6-O bond to break, and the stereochemical configuration at C6 is inverted.\n*   The starting configuration at C6 is given as (6S).\n*   Due to the inversion of configuration, the new stereocenter at this carbon in the product will be (R).\n\n**4. Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring, and after an aqueous workup (which is implicit), the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   A new methyl group is added to C6. The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are unaffected.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   For IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated C1. This corresponds to C1 of the reactant. The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The nucleophilic attack happened at C6 of the starting material, which becomes C2 in the final product, (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The stereocenters at reactant C3 and C4 are undisturbed and become C5 and C4 in the product, respectively, retaining their 'R' configuration.\n*   The crucial point is the inversion at the site of attack. The C6 carbon of the reactant becomes the C2 carbon of the product, and its configuration inverts from S to R.\n*   Thus, the product must have a (2R) configuration.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) (1R,2**S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,2**R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOptions C and D have an incorrect substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...). Options A and B have the correct substitution pattern (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl...). The determining factor is the stereochemistry at C2, which must be R due to the inversion of configuration. This eliminates option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
