    "### Calculation of the Absorption Line's Rest-Frame Energy\n\nTo determine the nature of the observed absorption line, we must first find its energy in the rest-frame of the emitting source. The light from an object at a distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc) is significantly redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. This means the observed energy of the absorption line (3.9 µeV) is lower than its original energy.\n\n1.  **Determining the Redshift (z)**: The distance to the object (d = 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc) can be used to calculate the redshift. Using a standard cosmological model (ΛCDM with H₀ ≈ 67.4 km/s/Mpc), a comoving distance of 2100 Mpc corresponds to a redshift (z) of approximately 0.57.\n\n2.  **Calculating the Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest)**: The rest-frame energy is related to the observed energy (E_obs) by the formula:\n    `E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)`\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    `E_rest = 3.9 µeV * (1 + 0.57) = 3.9 µeV * 1.57 ≈ 6.12 µeV`\n\n### Identifying the Interstellar Medium Component\n\nThe calculated rest-frame energy of approximately 6.12 micro-electron volts (µeV) closely matches the energy of a well-known spectral line in astrophysics.\n\n*   **The 21-cm Line of Neutral Hydrogen (HI)**: This line arises from the hyperfine \"spin-flip\" transition in the ground state of neutral hydrogen atoms. The energy difference between these two states is about 5.87 to 5.9 µeV. This value is in strong agreement with our calculated rest-frame energy.\n\n*   **Phases of the Interstellar Medium**: The 21-cm line is a key tracer of the neutral interstellar medium (ISM). The ISM exists in several phases, including the warm neutral medium (WNM) and the cold neutral medium (CNM). While the 21-cm line can be seen in emission from both the warm and cold phases, absorption lines are specifically characteristic of cold gas. When there is a source of bright radio continuum in the background, colder clouds of atomic hydrogen in the foreground will absorb the radiation at the 21-cm wavelength, creating an absorption feature.\n\nTherefore, an absorption line corresponding to the 21-cm transition of neutral hydrogen is most likely to be observed in the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<D>>>"
