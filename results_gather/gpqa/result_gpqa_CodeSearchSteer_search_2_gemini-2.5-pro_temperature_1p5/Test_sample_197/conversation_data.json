    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in the solution, we need to calculate the mole fraction of this species relative to all other cobalt-containing species.\n\nThe relevant species in the solution are:\n*   Free Co²⁺ ion\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)]₂\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺,         β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]₂,       β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]₃⁻,     β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]₄²⁻,   β₄ = 16\n\nThe fraction (α_n) of each cobalt species can be calculated using the following general formula, where L represents the ligand SCN⁻:\nα_n = (β_n * [L]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[L] + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴)\nFor the free metal ion, α₀ = 1 / (1 + β₁[L] + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴).\n\nThe problem states that the thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration of 10⁻² M is not needed for the calculation of the percentage distribution, as the free cobalt ion concentration ([Co²⁺]) cancels out from the fraction calculation.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator of the fraction, which is the sum of all terms. Let [L] = [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n\n1.  Term 0 (for Co²⁺): 1\n2.  Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁[L] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n3.  Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)]₂): β₂[L]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n4.  Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)]₃⁻): β₃[L]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n5.  Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)]₄²⁻): β₄[L]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. This corresponds to Term 2. The fraction α₂ is:\nα₂ = (Term 2) / (Denominator)\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, approximately 16.9% of the cobalt in the solution exists as the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n<<<D>>>"
