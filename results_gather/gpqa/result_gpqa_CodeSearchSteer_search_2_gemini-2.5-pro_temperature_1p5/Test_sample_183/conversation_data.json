    "An analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution, as well as the potential for multi-step functional group transformations.\n\n### Target Molecule Analysis\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are **ortho** to each other.\n*   tert-Butyl and nitro are **ortho** to each other.\n*   Ethoxy and nitro are **meta** to each other.\n\n### Evaluation of Synthetic Pathways\n\nA sound synthetic strategy must install these groups in the correct positions with high yield. This involves considering the activating/deactivating nature and ortho-, para-, or meta-directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n*   **-C(CH₃)₃ (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho,para-director. It is very bulky, strongly favoring substitution at the para position to minimize steric hindrance.\n*   **-OCH₂CH₃ (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH₂ (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director. Can be converted to -OH via diazotization.\n*   **-SO₃H (sulfonic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director. Crucially, it is a reversible blocking group that can be removed with dilute acid and heat.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options step-by-step.\n\n#### **Option A**\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation):** Benzene is converted to tert-butylbenzene.\nii) **HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** The tert-butyl group directs the incoming nitro group. Due to the bulkiness of the tert-butyl group, the major product is overwhelmingly the para isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. The ortho isomer, which would be needed for a 1,2,3-pattern, is formed in very low yield. This makes the overall synthesis not \"high-yield\" if it relied on the ortho isomer. However, let's follow the major product pathway.\niii) **Fe/HCl (Reduction):** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\niv) **HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** The amino group is a very strong ortho,para-director. It must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation to form acetanilide) to prevent oxidation and to moderate its reactivity. The acetamido group (-NHCOCH₃) directs ortho to itself. The tert-butyl group is at the para position. Thus, nitration occurs at the position ortho to the acetamido group, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** (after hydrolysis of the amide).\nv) **NaNO₂/HCl (Diazotization):** The amino group of 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.\nvi) **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat (Hydrolysis):** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\nvii) **NaOH/EtBr (Williamson Ether Synthesis):** The phenolic -OH group is deprotonated by NaOH and then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\nviii) **SO₃/H₂SO₄ (Sulfonation)** and **ix) dilute H₂SO₄ (Desulfonation):** These final two steps would sulfonate the ring and then remove the sulfonic acid group, making them redundant and pointless.\n\nThe product of this sequence is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target itself. The substituents are in a 1,2,4-arrangement. Therefore, this option does not lead to the desired product.\n\n#### **Option B**\ni) **HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene.\nii) **Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline.\niii) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions fail on aniline because the amino group complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. Even if the amine is protected as an acetanilide, it directs the incoming tert-butyl group to the para position. This pathway does not work.\n\n#### **Option C** and **Option D**\nBoth of these options seem to contain typos or have steps in an illogical order. For instance, in Option C, step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), but there is no amino group present at that stage. Option D has two nitration steps in a row in a way that is synthetically unviable (`v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4`).\n\n### Conclusion\nUpon rigorous examination, none of the provided options describe a correct, high-yield synthesis for **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Option A describes a plausible multi-step synthesis, but it yields the wrong isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene). Options B, C, and D contain fundamental flaws in their proposed sequences. Given the constraints of the question, there is likely a significant error in the question itself, either in the name of the target compound or in the listed steps of the options.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" synthesis among the flawed choices, the sequence in A is the most elaborate and follows a logical (though ultimately incorrect for the stated target) progression of standard organic reactions. It's plausible that the intended target was the isomer produced by pathway A, and the name was written incorrectly in the prompt.\n\nGiven the significant flaws in all options for producing the named target, a definitive correct answer cannot be determined from the choices provided. However, pathway A represents a coherent synthesis of a related isomer.\n\nAfter re-evaluating the possibility of steric hindrance guiding the tert-butylation of 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene to the C2 position, it remains a less likely pathway compared to substitution at the more electronically favored and less hindered C6 position. The most chemically sound methods for creating the ortho-ortho relationship between the substituents involve a blocking group strategy, which is not correctly represented in any of the options to produce the final target molecule.\n\nTherefore, based on a rigorous analysis, none of the options are correct. But if we must assume an error in the question and choose the most coherent synthetic sequence presented, option A is the only one that represents a viable (though long) synthesis of *an* isomer. For the purpose of selecting an answer from the given list, it's the most likely intended sequence despite leading to the wrong named product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
