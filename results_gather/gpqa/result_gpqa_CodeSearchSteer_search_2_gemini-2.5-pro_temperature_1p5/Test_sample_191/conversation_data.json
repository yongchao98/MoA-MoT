    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the situation based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge +q placed inside the cavity will attract negative charges from the conductor to the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). To completely cancel the electric field within the conducting material, a total charge of -q is induced on this inner surface. Because the charge +q is not at the center of the cavity, this induced charge -q will be distributed non-uniformly on the inner surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of -q has been drawn to the inner surface, a charge of +q must appear on the outer surface to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The conducting material isolates the outer surface from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (+q) and on the cavity's inner wall (-q). This means the arrangement of charges inside does not influence the charge distribution on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface is a sphere and it is shielded from the internal (and any external) fields, the induced charge +q will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, for the point P located at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, the electric field is determined solely by the +q charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface. This is equivalent to having a point charge of +q at the center of the large sphere. The complex arrangement inside the cavity (the exact position 's', the distance 'l', the angle 'Î¸') is irrelevant to the field outside due to shielding.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
