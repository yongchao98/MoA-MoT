    "Here is an analysis of the provided reactions to determine the correct reagents.\n\n### Reaction 1:\n**butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. It involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (from NaCN) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n\n1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n2.  This forms an intermediate alkoxide ion.\n3.  This alkoxide ion then needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product.\n\nReagent 'A' must be a proton source. Typically, these reactions are carried out by generating hydrocyanic acid (HCN) in situ by adding a strong acid to a cyanide salt like NaCN. The presence of an acid (H₃O⁺) facilitates the protonation of the alkoxide intermediate. Therefore, H₃O⁺ is a suitable choice for reagent A. While NaHSO₃ can react with ketones, it is used to form bisulfite addition products and is not the standard reagent for this specific transformation.\n\n### Reaction 2:\n**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n1.  This transformation is a standard hydrolysis reaction.\n2.  The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating.\n3.  Among the choices for reagent 'B', HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and an effective catalyst for this hydrolysis. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and generally not sufficient to catalyze this reaction efficiently.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺** for the cyanohydrin formation.\n*   Reagent **B** is **HCl** for the nitrile hydrolysis.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
