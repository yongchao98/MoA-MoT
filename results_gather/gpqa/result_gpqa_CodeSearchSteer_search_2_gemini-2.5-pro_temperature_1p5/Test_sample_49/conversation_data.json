    "The number of loops in the Feynman diagram can be determined from the mathematical expression provided.\n\n### Analysis of the Expression\n\nThe scribbled note shows the expression: `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations, particularly when using dimensional regularization, each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces a characteristic mathematical factor. The theory is specified to be on **four-dimensional spacetime**.\n\nFor a calculation in *d* spacetime dimensions, each loop integral over a virtual particle's momentum introduces a factor proportional to `1/(4π)^(d/2)`. Since the theory is in four dimensions, we set *d*=4.\n\nThe factor per loop is therefore: `1/(4π)^(4/2) = 1/(4π)^2`.\n\nFor a diagram with *L* loops, this factor appears *L* times, leading to a total factor of: `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe expression on the note contains the term `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing this with the general formula, we can deduce the number of loops, *L*:\n\n`1/(4pi)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nThis implies that `2L = 6`, and therefore `L = 3`.\n\nThe other terms in the expression are consistent with a 3-loop diagram:\n*   **`alpha^3 * g^2`**: `alpha` (α) and `g` are coupling constants, representing the strength of interactions at the diagram's vertices. The powers indicate the number of vertices of each type, which is consistent with the complexity of a 3-loop diagram.\n*   **`sqrt(2) * 8`**: These are numerical constants that typically arise from symmetry factors of the diagram or from evaluating Dirac traces in fermion loops.\n*   **`(Q/M)^2`**: This is a ratio of energy scales (Q) to mass scales (M), which is a common feature of loop-level calculations after regularization.\n\nThe most direct and reliable indicator of the loop number is the power of the `1/(4π)` term, which points unambiguously to a 3-loop diagram.\n\nTherefore, the diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
