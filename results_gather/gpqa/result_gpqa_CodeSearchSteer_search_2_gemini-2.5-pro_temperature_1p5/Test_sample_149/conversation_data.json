    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** 5. This indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet for two protons corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to a single proton (the aldehyde proton).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** The data corresponds to **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The structure consists of a para-substituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH₂) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO) as the two substituents.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reaction converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is converted to 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O, Heat**\n    Heating the diazonium salt in water results in hydrolysis, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction produces **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This set of reagents promotes an aldol condensation reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The reaction first proceeds through an aldol addition, where the enolate of one molecule attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, specifically **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The term \"Heat\" is crucial. Heating the aldol addition product in a basic solution causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). This elimination is strongly favored because it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, a known compound.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction proceeds to the most stable product under the given conditions. The heat applied in the final step drives the reaction from the initial aldol adduct (Option D) to the dehydrated, conjugated condensation product (Option C).\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
