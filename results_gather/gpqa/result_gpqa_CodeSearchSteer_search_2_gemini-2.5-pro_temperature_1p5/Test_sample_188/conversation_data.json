    "When a continuous symmetry of a physical system is spontaneously broken, Goldstone's theorem dictates that new particles, known as Nambu-Goldstone bosons (or Goldstone bosons), must appear. These particles are massless, or very light if the symmetry is also explicitly broken.\n\n*   **Pion:** Pions are the pseudo-Goldstone bosons that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This symmetry is also explicitly broken by the masses of quarks, which is why pions are not perfectly massless but are significantly lighter than other hadrons.\n*   **Phonon:** In a crystal, the continuous translational symmetry of space is spontaneously broken because the atoms form a discrete lattice. Phonons, which are quantized sound waves or vibrational modes in the crystal, are the Goldstone bosons associated with this broken translational symmetry. In a superfluid, the phonon is the Goldstone boson for the spontaneously broken U(1) particle number symmetry and Galilean symmetry.\n*   **Magnon:** In a ferromagnet, the spins of the atoms align in a specific direction, spontaneously breaking the original rotational symmetry of the system. Magnons, which are quantized spin waves, are the Goldstone bosons resulting from this broken symmetry.\n\nA **Skyrmion**, on the other hand, is a topological soliton. It is a stable, particle-like, swirling configuration within a field. While the theory in which Skyrmions were first proposed (the Skyrme model) describes the low-energy dynamics of pions—which are themselves Goldstone bosons—the Skyrmion itself is not a Goldstone boson. It is a topologically non-trivial solution to the equations of motion for the pion field. In essence, a Skyrmion is a collective excitation or a configuration of the Goldstone boson field, not the Goldstone boson itself.\n\nTherefore, the pion, phonon, and magnon are all directly associated with spontaneously broken symmetries as Goldstone bosons, whereas the Skyrmion is a topological entity that exists within a theory that may feature spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n<<<A>>>"
