    "My derivation seems solid and is a standard approach to this kind of problem. The search results confirm that for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, energy is conserved, and the total energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy (plus rest mass energy) and the potential energy.\n\nSpecifically, a Lagrangian formulation is often used, `L = -mc^2 * sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) - (1/2)kx^2`. The total energy E is derived from this as `E = γmc^2 + (1/2)kx^2`, which is exactly what I used. Some sources use different formalisms, but the energy conservation principle remains the key.\n\nLet's re-state the energy conservation principle:\nThe total energy `E` of the system is constant.\n`E = γ(v)mc^2 + (1/2)kx^2`\n\nAt the point of maximum amplitude, `x = A`, the velocity `v` is 0.\nAt this point, `γ(0) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0) = 1`.\nSo, the total energy is `E = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2`.\n\nAt the equilibrium position, `x = 0`, the velocity is at its maximum, `v = v_max`.\nAt this point, `γ(v_max) = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)`.\nThe potential energy is `(1/2)k(0)^2 = 0`.\nSo, the total energy is `E = γ(v_max)mc^2`.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the total energy:\n`γ(v_max)mc^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2`\n\nNow, let `γ_max = γ(v_max)`.\n`γ_max * mc^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2`\n\nDivide by `mc^2`:\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\nSubstitute back the definition of `γ_max`:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\nNow, solve for `v_max`.\nSquare the inverse of both sides:\n`1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n\nRearrange the terms:\n`v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n\n`v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2)`\n\nThis result matches option B exactly. The derivation is straightforward and confirmed by the principles discussed in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) `v_max=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}` - This is the non-relativistic limit. We can see that if `c` is very large, the `kA^2 / (2mc^2)` term in my derived expression becomes very small.\nLet `\\epsilon = kA^2 / (2mc^2)`.\nMy expression is `v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + \\epsilon)^2)`.\nUsing the binomial approximation `(1+\\epsilon)^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2\\epsilon`.\n`v_max \\approx c * sqrt(1 - (1 - 2\\epsilon)) = c * sqrt(2\\epsilon)`\n`v_max \\approx c * sqrt(2 * (kA^2 / (2mc^2))) = c * sqrt(kA^2 / (mc^2)) = sqrt(k A^2 / m)`.\nSo, option A is the correct classical limit, but not the relativistic answer.\n\nB) `v_max=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}` - Matches my derivation.\n\nC) `v_max=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}` - Incorrect structure and missing `c^2`.\n\nD) `v_max=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}` - Incorrect structure.\n\nThe derivation is confirmed. The answer is B.\n\nThe problem requires determining the maximum speed, $v_{max}$, of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator of mass $m$. The oscillator is subject to Hooke's law, $F = -kx$, and has a maximum amplitude of $A$.\n\n1.  **Potential Energy:** The force is conservative, and the potential energy associated with Hooke's law is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the rest mass, and $c$ is the speed of light. This total energy includes the rest energy $E_0 = mc^2$ and the relativistic kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:** For the harmonic oscillator system, the total energy is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring field. This total system energy must be conserved.\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$\n\n4.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude:** At the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude), $x = A$, the mass comes to a momentary stop, so its velocity is $v = 0$. At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$. The total energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n5.  **Energy at Equilibrium Position:** The speed is maximum, $v = v_{max}$, when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$. At this point, the potential energy is $U(0) = 0$. The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$. The total energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n6.  **Equating the Energies:** By the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n7.  **Solving for $v_{max}$:**\n    First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we rearrange the equation. First, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Next, square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
