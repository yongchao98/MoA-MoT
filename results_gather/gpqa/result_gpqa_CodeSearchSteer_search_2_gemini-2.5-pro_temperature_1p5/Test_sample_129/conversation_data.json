    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift for detecting Lyman-alpha absorption with ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider two main factors: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based observations.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength (λ₀)**: Neutral hydrogen absorbs light at the specific Lyman-alpha wavelength, which has a rest wavelength (λ₀) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff**: The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most ultraviolet radiation, effectively blocking light with wavelengths shorter than a certain limit. This \"atmospheric cutoff\" prevents UV light from reaching ground-based telescopes. While observations at redshifts less than ~1.6 require space-based UV telescopes, the Lyman-alpha forest can be observed from the ground when it is redshifted to the optical atmospheric window. This window begins at wavelengths longer than the cutoff. The specific cutoff wavelength is approximately 3500-4000 Å. For instance, some studies limit their analysis to wavelengths above 3650 Å to avoid the detector cutoff.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation**: The redshift (z) relates the rest wavelength (λ₀) and the observed wavelength (λ_obs) by the formula:\n\n    z = (λ_obs / λ₀) - 1\n\nTo find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we must use the minimum observable wavelength, which is the atmospheric cutoff wavelength. Let's calculate the redshift using a conservative atmospheric cutoff value of approximately 3500 Å.\n\n*   λ₀ = 1216 Å\n*   λ_obs (min) ≈ 3500 Å\n\n    z_min = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n    z_min ≈ 2.88 - 1\n    z_min ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculated redshift of approximately 1.88 is very close to 1.9. Research confirms that the Lyman-alpha forest generated at redshifts greater than 2 can be observed by ground-based telescopes, which is consistent with this calculation. Observations at lower redshifts, such as z < 1.6, necessitate the use of space-based telescopes.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable estimate for the lower limit on the redshift is 1.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
