    "This is a particle physics problem that can be solved by applying the principles of special relativity and the properties of particle decay. Here is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Identify Given Values\n*   Total energy of the meson (E_X): 8 GeV\n*   Mass of the meson (m_X): 1.2 GeV\n*   Decay width of the meson (Γ_X): 320 MeV\n\n### 2. Determine Necessary Formulas\nThe mean decay distance (L) of a particle is the distance it travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is calculated as:\nL = v * τ_lab\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the particle's velocity.\n*   `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is related to the proper lifetime (τ), which is the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame, by the Lorentz factor (γ):\nτ_lab = γ * τ\n\nThe proper lifetime (τ) is related to the decay width (Γ) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nwhere `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these, we get:\nL = v * γ * (ħ / Γ)\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the momentum `p` is given by p = γ * m * v. Therefore, v * γ = p / m.\nSubstituting this into the equation for L gives a more direct formula:\nL = (p / m_X) * (ħ / Γ_X)\n\nTo use this formula, we first need to calculate the momentum `p`. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:\nE_X² = (p*c)² + (m_X*c²)²\n\nFor simplicity in particle physics, we often use natural units where the speed of light c=1. The formula becomes:\np = sqrt(E_X² - m_X²)\n\n### 3. Unify Units\nIt's essential to use consistent units for the calculation. Let's convert all energy values to MeV:\n*   E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n*   Γ_X = 320 MeV\n\n### 4. Perform the Calculation\n\n**a) Calculate the momentum (p):**\np = sqrt(E_X² - m_X²)\np = sqrt(8000² - 1200²) MeV/c\np = sqrt(64,000,000 - 1,440,000) MeV/c\np = sqrt(62,560,000) MeV/c\np ≈ 7909.49 MeV/c\n\n**b) Calculate the mean decay distance (L):**\nWe use the formula L = (p / m_X) * (ħc / Γ_X). The value of the physical constant ħc is approximately 197.327 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\n\nL = (7909.49 MeV/c / 1200 MeV/c²) * (ħc / 320 MeV)\nL = (6.5912) * (197.327 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nL = (6.5912) * (0.6166 fm)\nL ≈ 4.0642 fm\n\n**c) Convert to meters:**\nSince 1 fm (femtometer) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters:\nL ≈ 4.0642 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculated value of approximately 4.0642 * 10⁻¹⁵ m is closest to option B. The minor difference between the calculated value and the option is likely due to the precision of the constants used in the problem's original source.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
