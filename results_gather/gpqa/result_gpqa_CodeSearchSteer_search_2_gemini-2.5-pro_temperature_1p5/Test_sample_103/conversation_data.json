    "The search results confirm the physics I used.\n\n*   **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity ($v_r$) is related to the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by the Doppler formula $v_r = c (\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0)$. This confirms that the observed wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity. The maximum shift corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K.\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude (K):** For a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude K is given by a formula that depends on the orbital period (P or T), the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the orbital inclination ($i$). Several sources give variations of the formula, which is consistent with the one I derived:\n\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\n*   **Problem Interpretation:** The key assumptions from the problem statement are:\n    *   $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$ (explicitly stated).\n    *   Orbits are circular (explicitly stated).\n    *   $M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$ and we can assume $\\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2$. The problem says the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV measurements, which determine the minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$), it's a standard simplification in such problems to assume the $M_p \\sin i$ term is the same for both systems.\n\nBased on this, my derivation remains correct.\n\nLet's quickly re-state the logic:\n\n1.  The RV semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to the maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$).\n    *   $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ\n    *   $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of semi-amplitudes is $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n\n2.  The formula for the semi-amplitude shows its dependency on the orbital period (P):\n    *   $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ when other parameters ($M_{star}$, $M_p \\sin i$) are held constant.\n\n3.  We can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    *   $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  Now, we solve for the ratio of the periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$:\n    *   $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   Cube both sides: $\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    *   $\\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    *   Invert the fraction to get the desired ratio: $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n5.  Calculate the final numerical value:\n    *   $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis result matches option C. The reasoning is sound and confirmed by the physics of the radial velocity method.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" This asks for the ratio $T_2 / T_1$. My calculation correctly solves for this ratio. The result is less than 1, meaning the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.\n\nThe reasoning is solid. I'm ready for the final answer.\n\n### Final Calculation Review\n- $K_2/K_1 = 7/5 = 1.4$\n- $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n- $K_2/K_1 = (P_2/P_1)^{-1/3}$\n- $1.4 = (P_2/P_1)^{-1/3}$\n- $(P_2/P_1)^{1/3} = 1/1.4$\n- $P_2/P_1 = (1/1.4)^3 = 1 / (1.4^3) = 1 / 2.744 \\approx 0.3644$\nThe answer is C.\n\nTo provide a final answer, I will outline the steps clearly based on the established physics.\n\n**1. Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:**\nThe measured periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n*   $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5 \\text{ mÅ}$\n*   $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7 \\text{ mÅ}$\n*   This gives the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n**2. Use the Radial Velocity Formula:**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{\\star}^{2/3}}$\nwhere P is the orbital period, $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{\\star}$ is the star mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n**3. Apply the Given Conditions:**\nThe problem states that the stellar masses are identical ($M_{\\star1} = M_{\\star2}$) and the planet masses are similar ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$). As the radial velocity method measures the minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$), and no information on inclination is given, we assume the detectable quantity $M_p \\sin i$ is the same for both planets. Therefore, all terms in the equation are constant except for K and P.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n$K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Period Ratio:**\nWe can write the relationship for the two planets as a ratio:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n$\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nTo find the required ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we first cube both sides:\n$\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n$\\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\nFinally, we invert the expression:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option C.\n\nThis detailed derivation confirms the choice. No further search or calculation is needed.\n\nFinal answer format is <<<X>>>.\n\nThe calculation leads directly to option C.\n\nTo be extra certain there is no misinterpretation, let's analyze the phrase \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\".\nThis is $T_2/T_1$. If $T_2$ were twice as long as $T_1$, the answer would be 2. My result is ~0.36. This means planet #2 has a shorter period. The phrasing of the question can be interpreted as just asking for the ratio, regardless of whether it's longer or shorter. The options provided are all numbers, so they represent the value of the ratio $T_2/T_1$.\n\nSeems everything is in order.\n<<<C>>>The relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) of a star and the orbital period (P) of its planet can be derived from the laws of gravity and motion. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:\n\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{\\star}^{2/3}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{\\star}$ is the mass of the host star.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the planet's orbit to our line of sight.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe periodic shift of a spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity. Therefore, the maximum shift is proportional to the RV semi-amplitude, K.\n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n*   For Planet #1, the shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms.\n*   For Planet #2, the shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n\nThis implies that the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\nThe problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{\\star1} = M_{\\star2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$). The RV method measures the minimum mass, $M_p \\sin i$. In the context of such a problem, it is assumed that this measured quantity is the same for both systems. With these parameters being equal for both systems, the formula simplifies to show that the semi-amplitude $K$ is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period $P$:\n\n$K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\nWe can now write a ratio for the two planet-star systems:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_1^{1/3}}{P_2^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nSubstituting the known ratio of the semi-amplitudes:\n$\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. To find this, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n$\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n$\\frac{343}{125} = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\nFinally, we invert the fraction to get the desired ratio:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>"
