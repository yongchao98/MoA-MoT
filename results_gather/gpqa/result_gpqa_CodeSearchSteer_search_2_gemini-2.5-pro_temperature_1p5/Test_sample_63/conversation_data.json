    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes, allowing for the identification and quantification of the components:\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted to form copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the sequential removal of water and oxygen, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   This remaining gas is non-reactive with the agents in the tubes, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nTo confirm the identities of the products, we can check the mass balance. The total mass of the initial salt mixture was 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = 0.1 mol * 28.014 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of gaseous products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g\n\nThe total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the reactants, confirming that decomposition was complete and our product identification (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) is correct.\n\n**2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe gaseous products contain nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. The original salts must therefore be composed of these elements. Since the problem describes salts that decompose completely into gases upon heating, ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyacids are strong candidates.\n\nLet's examine the molar ratios of the products:\n*   N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.1 mol : 0.025 mol : 0.2 mol\n*   Simplifying this ratio by dividing by the smallest value (0.025) gives: **4 : 1 : 8**\n\nNow, consider the thermal decomposition of likely salts:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to produce nitrogen and water:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** At higher temperatures (above 250-300°C), its decomposition primarily produces nitrogen, oxygen, and water:\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. Let's assume we have 'n' moles of Salt A and 'n' moles of Salt B. If we hypothesize that the salts are ammonium nitrate (A) and ammonium nitrite (B):\n*   **From n moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio):**\n    *   n moles of N₂\n    *   0.5n moles of O₂\n    *   2n moles of H₂O\n*   **From n moles of NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   n moles of N₂\n    *   2n moles of H₂O\n\nCombining the products from the equimolar mixture:\n*   **Total N₂** = n + n = 2n\n*   **Total O₂** = 0.5n\n*   **Total H₂O** = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nThe predicted molar ratio of the products from this mixture is **N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 2n : 0.5n : 4n**, which simplifies to **4 : 1 : 8**. This perfectly matches the experimentally determined ratio.\n\nWe can now find the value of 'n' using the known moles of any product:\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n\nThis confirms the initial mixture contained 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrate and 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrite.\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two identified salts.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\nThe total number of atoms in both salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**\n\n<<<B>>>"
