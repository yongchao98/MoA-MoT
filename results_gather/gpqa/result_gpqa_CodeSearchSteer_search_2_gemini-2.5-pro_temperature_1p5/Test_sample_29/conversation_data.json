    "A textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV absorbs red light. This conclusion is reached through a two-step process involving the calculation of the emitted light's wavelength and the principles of color absorption and emission.\n\nFirst, the energy of the emitted light is converted to its corresponding wavelength. Using the formula E = hc/λ, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength, or the more direct conversion λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV), the wavelength can be calculated. For an energy of 2.3393 eV, the wavelength is approximately 530 nanometers.\n\nA wavelength of 530 nm falls within the green region of the visible light spectrum.\n\nAccording to the principles of color theory, the color an object appears to be is the color of light it reflects or emits. The color of light that is absorbed by the object is the complementary color to the one that is observed. In this case, since the dye emits green light, it must absorb the complementary color of green.\n\nThe complementary color of green is red. Therefore, the textile dye absorbs red light.\n\n<<<B>>>"
