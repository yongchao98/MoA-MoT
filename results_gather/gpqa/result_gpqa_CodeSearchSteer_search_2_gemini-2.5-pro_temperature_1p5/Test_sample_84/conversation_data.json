    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n    We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\n3.  **Finding the Semi-Major Axis (a)**\n    The semi-major axis `a` can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n    Because the planets are detected by both transit and RV methods, the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so we can assume sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² = (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K² = (G * M_p²) / (a * M_star)\n    a = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n4.  **Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Now we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\n    The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n5.  **Ratio of the RV Semi-Amplitudes (K)**\n    The RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ), where c and λ are constants. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n6.  **Combining and Calculating**\n    Substitute the ratio of K back into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\n    Now, substitute this result into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n    Finally, plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
