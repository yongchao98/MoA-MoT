    "The reaction sequence described is a multi-step organic synthesis. Here is a breakdown of each step to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. This forms 2-bromocyclohexanone as product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide and heated, it undergoes a classic ring-contraction reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Product 2 is therefore cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nProduct 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct. This reaction yields cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride as product 3.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\nProduct 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is an acid chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent that is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and will not reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol, allowing for the isolation of the aldehyde. This reaction forms cyclopentanecarbaldehyde as the final product (product 4).\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through:\n*   The aldehyde group (CHO).\n*   The carbon of the cyclopentane ring to which the aldehyde is attached (C1).\n*   The hydrogen atom on C1.\n\nThis plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their attached hydrogens equivalent.\n1.  **Aldehydic proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **Proton on C1:** The single hydrogen attached to the carbon bearing the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic—meaning they are not chemically equivalent to each other. One proton is *cis* (on the same side) and one is *trans* (on the opposite side) relative to the aldehyde group. Thus, the two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, creating two distinct types of protons from these four hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of protons. (2 types)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
