    "An oscillating charge distribution with a defined axis of symmetry (z-axis) can be modeled as a simple oscillating electric dipole. The behavior of its radiation is well-described by classical electrodynamics.\n\n*   **Angular Distribution of Power:** For an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle `θ` with respect to the dipole axis. The formula is proportional to `sin²(θ)`. The maximum power, `A`, is radiated at `θ = 90°` (perpendicular to the axis), where `sin²(90°) = 1`. We need to find the fraction of this maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°`.\n\n    The power at 30 degrees is proportional to `sin²(30°)`.\n    Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    Therefore, the power radiated at 30° is `1/4` of the maximum power `A`.\n\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is related to the frequency of oscillation (`ω`). Specifically, the power is proportional to `ω⁴`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    Substituting this into the power relationship, we find that the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`, or `λ⁻⁴`. This inverse-fourth-power dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is famously known as Rayleigh's law, which explains, for instance, why the sky is blue.\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is 1/4, and the power's dependence on wavelength has the form `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
