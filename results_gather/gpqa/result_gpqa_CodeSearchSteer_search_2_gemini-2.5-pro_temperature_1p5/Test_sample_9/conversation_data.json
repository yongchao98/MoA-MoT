    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes Earth itself. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm続.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm続:** The density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm続. This is very close to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same rocky composition, a more massive planet experiences greater gravitational compression. This self-compression packs the material more tightly, resulting in a higher overall density. Therefore, a planet with 5 times the mass of Earth and the same composition would be significantly denser than Earth. For example, some models show that a rocky planet with 5 Earth masses could have a density well above Earth's. Studies of super-Earths indicate that for rocky planets, density tends to increase with mass and radius up to a certain point.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass than Earth and the same composition would experience weaker gravitational compression. Consequently, its density would be lower than Earth's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, Planet (c) would be compressed by its own substantial gravity to a much greater degree than the others. This gravitational compression would result in the highest density among the choices. Planet (a) and (b) have densities around 5.5 g/cm続, while Planet (d) would be less dense.\n\n<<<B>>>"
