    "To identify the correct ¹H NMR data, we must first deduce the most likely structure of the compound based on the information provided.\n\n### Analysis of the Compound's Structure:\n1.  **Core Structure**: A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring implies a benzene ring with two groups attached (C₆H₄).\n2.  **Total Carbons**: The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Functional Groups (from FTIR)**:\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present, meaning a halogen (e.g., Cl, Br) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n### Deducing the Substituents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most plausible and common structure for a C₂-carbonyl substituent is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n\nCombining these parts, the most probable structure is a **haloacetophenone**. Assuming a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which leads to a simple and symmetrical NMR spectrum, a likely candidate is 4-chloroacetophenone or 4-bromoacetophenone.\n\n### Predicting the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Haloacetophenone:\nA para-substituted haloacetophenone has two sets of protons:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons**: Due to the symmetry of the para-substitution, there are two distinct types of aromatic protons. Each type is adjacent to the other, resulting in two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm). Since there are four protons on the ring in total, each doublet will integrate to 2H.\n2.  **Methyl Protons**: The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these three protons will appear as a singlet. This signal is typically found in the 2.0-3.0 ppm range.\n\nSo, the predicted spectrum is: two doublets (each 2H) and one singlet (3H).\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows a signal at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals are not in the typical aromatic region and the integration and splitting patterns do not match our predicted structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for a para-substituted haloacetophenone. It has two doublets in the aromatic region integrating to 2H each (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) and a singlet integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm (`2.3 (3H, s)`). This is confirmed by spectral data for compounds like 4-chloroacetophenone, which shows a singlet for the methyl group around 2.6 ppm and two doublets for the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), which contradicts the compound being an aromatic ring.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option C is the only one that correctly represents the ¹H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
