    "Here is an analysis of the major products for each rearrangement:\n\n### **Reaction A: (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene + (1. BuLi, 2. H+) → A**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is prenyl benzyl ether, with the structure (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-O-CH₂-Ph.\n2.  **Reaction with BuLi:** n-Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic C-H bond. In this molecule, the benzylic protons (on the -CH₂-Ph group) are more acidic (pKa ≈ 41) than the allylic protons (pKa ≈ 43). Deprotonation thus occurs at the benzylic carbon to form an anion: (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-O-CH⁻-Ph.\n3.  **Rearrangement:** The resulting intermediate is perfectly set up for a Wittig rearrangement. This can proceed via a-sigmatropic shift or a-sigmatropic shift.\n    *   The **-Wittig rearrangement** is a concerted pericyclic reaction and is generally kinetically favored. It would proceed through a five-membered transition state. However, the steric hindrance between the phenyl group and the gem-dimethyl group of the prenyl moiety can significantly inhibit this pathway.\n    *   The **-Wittig rearrangement** proceeds through a stepwise mechanism involving the formation of a radical pair. The high stability of the benzyl radical (Ph-CH•) that would be formed makes this pathway competitive. Given the potential steric hindrance for the pathway, the-rearrangement is expected to yield the major product.\n4.  **Product of-Rearrangement:** The-shift results in the migration of the prenyl group to the anionic carbon. After protonation with H⁺, the product is an alcohol.\n    *   Product (A): **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**, with the structure Ph-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂. This matches the product given in options A and B.\n\n### **Reaction B: 3,4,5,7,8,9-hexamethyl-1,11-dimethylene-2,6,10,11,11a,11b-hexahydro-1H-benzo[cd]indeno[7,1-gh]azulene + Heat → B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The application of heat to a 1,5-diene system is characteristic of a Cope rearrangement, a-sigmatropic shift. The starting material is described as a \"dimethylene\" compound, which contains two `C=CH₂` groups that are part of a 1,5-diene framework.\n2.  **Conservation of Molecular Formula:** The Cope rearrangement is an intramolecular isomerization. This means that the molecular formula of the product is identical to that of the starting material. No atoms are added or lost.\n3.  **Analysis of Product Name:**\n    *   The starting material is described as being `...hexahydro...`.\n    *   One of the potential products for B is `...tetrahydro...`, which implies the loss of two hydrogen atoms. This would be an oxidation, not an intramolecular rearrangement.\n    *   The other potential product for B is `...hexahydro...`. This is consistent with an isomerization reaction like the Cope rearrangement, where the degree of saturation remains unchanged.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction B:** The major product (B) must have the same degree of saturation as the starting material. Therefore, the correct product is **2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**.\n*   Product B is **2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
