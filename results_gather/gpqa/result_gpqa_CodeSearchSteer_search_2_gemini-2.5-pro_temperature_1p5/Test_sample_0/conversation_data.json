    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than the natural energy width (or uncertainty) of each level. This energy width is determined by the lifetime of the state, according to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe relationship is given by the formula:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy (the energy width of the state).\n*   **Δt** is the lifetime of the state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nA quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a definite energy. A shorter lifetime (Δt) results in a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE), which is observed as a broader spectral line. Conversely, a longer-lived state has a narrower energy width.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each quantum state:\n\n1.  **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" their energy separation must be greater than their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). Therefore, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be substantially larger than this value.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.**\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the natural energy width of the broader state.\n\n<<<B>>>"
