    "This problem requires a careful analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, considering the directing effects of various substituents and the limitations of certain reactions like Friedel-Crafts acylation. The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃)\n*   A bromine atom (-Br)\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂)\n\nThese substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5, meaning they are all *meta* to each other. This 1,3,5-substitution pattern is a key clue. Achieving it directly is difficult because ortho/para directors and meta directors would not cooperate to create this specific arrangement.\n\nLet's evaluate the directing effects of the final substituents:\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an ortho,para-director.\n\nA common strategy to achieve such a substitution pattern is to introduce a powerful directing group, use it to place other substituents, and then either remove it or chemically transform it.\n\n### Evaluation of the Proposed Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n\n1.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a meta-director. This step is correct.\n2.  **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. This gives the correct 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups. This step is also correct.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Now we nitrate the 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents:\n    *   -COCH₃ at C1 (meta-director)\n    *   -Br at C3 (ortho,para-director)\n    The directing effects of these groups on an incoming electrophile (like NO₂⁺) are:\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs to position C5 (meta).\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6 (ortho and para).\n    In this case, the directing effects of the two existing groups reinforce each other to place the new substituent at position C5, which is meta to the acetyl group and also meta to the bromo group. Although both groups are deactivating, the nitration will proceed to yield the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n\nThe remaining steps in option A (iv to vii) seem extraneous, as the target molecule is successfully synthesized in the first three steps. This suggests that the question may present a more complex route than necessary, but the initial sequence in option A is chemically sound and leads directly to the desired product with high regioselectivity. The other options contain significant flaws.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n\n1.  **Benzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrobenzene:** The -NO₂ group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Nitrobenzene + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene:** The nitro group directs bromine to the meta position.\n3.  **1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → No reaction:** Friedel-Crafts reactions, including acylation, fail on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a nitro group. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n\n1.  **Benzene + Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromobenzene:** The -Br group is an ortho,para-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product):** Nitration occurs primarily at the para position due to the directing effect of bromine. This does not lead to the required meta relationship.\n3.  **Acylation** of the resulting product would also be difficult due to the deactivating nitro group. This path is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n\n1.  This sequence begins with nitration, followed by reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then removal of the diazonium group with H₃PO₂. This four-step process converts benzene... back into benzene, making the sequence illogical and inefficient.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most chemically logical and high-yield pathway among the choices is the one described in the first three steps of option A. The acetyl group is installed first, followed by bromination at the meta position, and then nitration, which is directed to the other meta position (C5) by the combined influence of the existing groups.\n\n<<<A>>>"
