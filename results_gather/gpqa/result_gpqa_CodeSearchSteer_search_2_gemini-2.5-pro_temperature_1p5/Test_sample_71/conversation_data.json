    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis**\n\n1.  **Formation of the Diene and Product 1:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene reacts with sodium iodide at an elevated temperature. This type of reaction, involving a 1,2-bis(dihalomethyl) precursor, is a known method for the *in-situ* generation of a reactive diene. In this case, it forms 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (let's call it **DX**). This diene then undergoes a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition with one of the double bonds of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative), which acts as the dienophile. The problem specifies two equivalents of the diene precursor, which could suggest a bis-addition, but the most plausible pathway leading to one of the answers involves a single Diels-Alder reaction. The excess reagent is likely to ensure the reaction goes to completion. The result of this first step is the mono-adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Formation of Product 2:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. The tert-butoxy group is a tert-butyl ether, which is readily cleaved under acidic conditions to form an alcohol. Thus, the 7-(tert-butoxy) group is hydrolyzed to a 7-hydroxy group, yielding **Product 2**, which is an alcohol.\n\n3.  **Formation of Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with sulfur trioxide (SO3) and pyridine in DMSO. This combination of reagents is characteristic of the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The secondary alcohol at the 7-position of the bicyclic core is oxidized to a ketone, forming **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Formation of Product 4:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C. Heating Diels-Alder adducts, especially those derived from strained systems like norbornene, often results in a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This reaction breaks the adduct down into its original diene and dienophile components. In this case, Product 3 will fragment into:\n    *   The diene: 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (**DX**)\n    *   The dienophile: 7-ketonorborn-5-ene (since one double bond from the original norbornadiene remains).\n\nThe fate of 7-ketonorborn-5-ene must be considered. While its cousin, 7-ketonorbornadiene, is known to be highly unstable and rapidly decomposes to benzene and carbon monoxide, 7-ketonorborn-5-ene is a more stable and known compound. Therefore, the thermal decomposition of Product 3 leads to a mixture of two organic products: 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (**DX**) and 7-ketonorborn-5-ene.\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final **product 4**. This phrasing is slightly ambiguous as two products are formed. However, one of the options in the multiple-choice question corresponds to the number of distinct hydrogen atoms in one of these products.\n\n### **Analysis of the Final Product's Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the regenerated diene, **DX** (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene), to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexadiene ring with two exocyclic double bonds at positions 5 and 6.\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to rapid ring-flipping, the molecule possesses an effective C₂ axis of symmetry. This axis passes through the midpoint of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n*   **Hydrogen Environments:** This symmetry makes certain protons chemically equivalent:\n    1.  The protons on C1 and C4 are equivalent.\n    2.  The protons on C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n    3.  The two exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) groups are equivalent. Within each methylene group, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule). Therefore, the two \"upper\" protons of the methylene groups form one set, and the two \"lower\" protons form another.\n\nCounting these sets gives a total of **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the final product in question is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
