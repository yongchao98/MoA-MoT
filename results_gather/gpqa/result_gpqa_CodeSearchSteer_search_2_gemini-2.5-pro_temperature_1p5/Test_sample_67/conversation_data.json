    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has a spin magnetic moment µ aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the Z direction, Sz. We can represent this \"spin up\" state as:\n    |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian of the System:** The magnetic field is abruptly switched to the +Y direction with magnitude B. The Hamiltonian (H) of a magnetic moment (µ) in a magnetic field (B) is given by H = -µ · B. Since µ = γS, where S is the spin operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n    H = -γS · B = -γB S<sub>y</sub>\n\n    Here, S<sub>y</sub> is the spin operator for the Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:** The state of the particle at any time *t* is determined by the Schrödinger equation, which gives:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = e<sup>-iHt/ħ</sup> |ψ(0)⟩ = e<sup>iγB S<sub>y</sub> t/ħ</sup> |+z⟩\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value:** We want to find the average (or expectation value) of the Z-component of the spin, ⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩, as a function of time. This is calculated as:\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S<sub>z</sub> |ψ(t)⟩\n\n    To solve this, we can express the operators and states in matrix form. In the S<sub>z</sub> basis, the spin operators and the initial state are:\n\n    S<sub>z</sub> = (ħ/2) *  [ 1  0 ]\n                     [ 0 -1 ]\n\n    S<sub>y</sub> = (ħ/2) *  [ 0 -i ]\n                     [ i  0 ]\n\n    |+z⟩ = [ 1 ]\n            [ 0 ]\n\n    The time evolution operator e<sup>iγB S<sub>y</sub> t/ħ</sup> simplifies to:\n    e<sup>i(γBt/2)σ<sub>y</sub></sup> = cos(γBt/2)I + i sin(γBt/2)σ<sub>y</sub>\n\n    where σ<sub>y</sub> is the Pauli Y matrix and I is the identity matrix. This gives:\n\n    e<sup>iγB S<sub>y</sub> t/ħ</sup> = [ cos(γBt/2)  sin(γBt/2) ]\n                      [ -sin(γBt/2) cos(γBt/2) ]\n\n5.  **Finding the State at Time t:**\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos(γBt/2)  sin(γBt/2) ] [ 1 ] = [ cos(γBt/2)  ]\n              [ -sin(γBt/2) cos(γBt/2) ] [ 0 ]   [ -sin(γBt/2) ]\n\n6.  **Final Calculation of ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩:**\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = [ cos(γBt/2)  -sin(γBt/2) ] * (ħ/2) [ 1  0 ] * [ cos(γBt/2)  ]\n                                                     [ 0 -1 ]   [ -sin(γBt/2) ]\n\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ cos(γBt/2)  -sin(γBt/2) ] * [ cos(γBt/2)   ]\n                                                     [ sin(γBt/2)   ]\n\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))\n\n    Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)\n\n7.  **Determining the Oscillation Frequency:** The expression for ⟨S<sub>z</sub>(t)⟩ shows that the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency of ω = γB. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The oscillation is a direct consequence of the spin precessing around the new magnetic field direction.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is therefore γB.\n\n<<<A>>>"
