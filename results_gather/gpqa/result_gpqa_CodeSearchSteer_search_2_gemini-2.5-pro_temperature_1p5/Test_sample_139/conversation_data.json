    "Based on the detailed chemical puzzle, the cumulative atomic mass is calculated to be 35.\n\n**Here is the step-by-step derivation:**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The melting point is very close to 277 K (which is 3.85 °C). This corresponds to the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n*   **Liquid Y:** Since the reaction with X produces deuterated compounds, Y is also **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (**D₂**) fits this description perfectly. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Substance X:** This substance reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. Its \"very close analog\" is a common reagent in organic chemistry. Furthermore, it reduces a keto acid to a product with two oxygen atoms. These clues strongly point to **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Violent Reaction:** LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water, including heavy water.\n    *   **Organic Reagent Analog:** Its analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is strong enough to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH). This transforms the acid, which has three oxygen atoms, into a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has only two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction of LiAlD₄ with excess D₂O produces soluble lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and a precipitate, **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**.\n*   **Heating G:** When aluminum deuteroxide (or hydroxide) is heated, it decomposes and releases heavy water (D₂O), which is substance B.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Elements in X:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n2.  **Lightest Element:** The element with the lowest atomic number is Hydrogen, present as its isotope Deuterium (D). There are **four** Deuterium atoms.\n3.  **Heaviest Element:** The element with the highest atomic number is Aluminum (Al). There is **one** Aluminum atom.\n4.  **Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The mass of an Aluminum (²⁷Al) atom is approximately **27** amu.\n    *   The mass of a Deuterium (²H) atom is approximately **2** amu.\n5.  **Cumulative Mass Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Total mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   Cumulative sum = 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
