    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the relationship between the number of stars and parallax, assuming a uniform spatial distribution of stars.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: The initial assumption is that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means that the number density of stars, denoted by ρ (the number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume**: The number of stars, *N*, within a certain volume, *V*, is simply the product of the density and the volume:\n    *N* = ρ *V*\n\n3.  **Volume of Space**: Let's consider a sphere of radius *d* centered on the observer. The volume of this sphere is:\n    *V* = (4/3)π*d*³\n\n4.  **Number of Stars up to a Distance *d***: The total number of stars (*N*) out to a distance *d* is therefore:\n    *N*(*d*) = ρ * (4/3)π*d*³\n\n5.  **Relating Distance and Parallax**: Stellar parallax (*plx*) is inversely proportional to the distance (*d*). The relationship is defined as *d* = 1/*plx*, where *d* is in parsecs and *plx* is in arcseconds.\n\n6.  **Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax**: We can substitute the distance-parallax relation into our equation for the number of stars. This gives us the number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to a certain value, *plx* (since a smaller distance corresponds to a larger parallax):\n    *N*(*plx*) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/*plx*)³ = ρ * (4/3)π * *plx*⁻³\n\n7.  **Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax**: The question asks how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* changes with *plx*. This is mathematically equivalent to finding the derivative of the number of stars with respect to parallax, d*N*/d(*plx*).\n\n    Differentiating the expression for *N*(*plx*) with respect to *plx*:\n    d*N*/d(*plx*) = d/d(*plx*) [ρ * (4/3)π * *plx*⁻³]\n\n    Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n    d*N*/d(*plx*) = ρ * (4/3)π * (-3 * *plx*⁻⁴)\n    d*N*/d(*plx*) = -4πρ * *plx*⁻⁴\n\n8.  **Final Proportionality**: The negative sign indicates that as parallax increases (i.e., as we look at closer stars), the cumulative number of stars decreases. The magnitude of this rate of change shows how the number of stars in a small interval of parallax depends on the parallax itself. The term 4πρ is a constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to *plx*⁻⁴ or 1/*plx*⁴.\n\nThis relationship is a foundational concept in stellar statistics and is mentioned in discussions of the Lutz-Kelker bias, where a uniform stellar distribution is assumed. For a uniform distribution of stars, the probability density of the true parallax per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/p⁴, where p is the true parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
