    "The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f**(r) within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field has a magnitude of 1/r² and is directed radially outward.\n\n### Vector Field and Divergence\n\nThe vector field can be expressed in spherical coordinates as:\n**f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**\n\nwhere **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence (∇ ⋅ **f**) in spherical coordinates for r ≠ 0 yields:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² * (1/r²)) = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (1) = 0.\n\nThis result suggests that the divergence is zero everywhere. However, the vector field is singular at the origin (r = 0), and a more careful approach is needed.\n\n### Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nA more robust method for this problem is the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field within a volume V is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface S that encloses the volume:\n\n∫ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, the volume V is the sphere of radius R, and the surface S is the spherical shell at r = R.\n\n1.  **The vector field on the surface S**: At r = R, the field is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n2.  **The differential surface area vector dS**: For a sphere, the outward-pointing surface element is d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**.\n3.  **The dot product** **f** ⋅ d**S**:\n    (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ( (1/R²) **r̂** ) ⋅ ( R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂** )\n    Since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1 and the R² terms cancel, this simplifies to:\n    (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n4.  **The surface integral**: We integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere, with θ ranging from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π.\n    ∮ sin(θ) dθ dφ = ∫₀²π dφ ∫₀ᵟ sin(θ) dθ\n    *   The integral of sin(θ) from 0 to π is [-cos(θ)]|₀ᵟ = -(-1) - (-1) = 2.\n    *   The integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is [φ]|₀²π = 2π.\n\n    Multiplying these results gives the total flux:\n    Flux = (2π) * (2) = 4π.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem shows that the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this flux. The non-zero result confirms that the divergence at the origin is not zero but is a singularity (specifically, a Dirac delta function) which, when integrated over the volume containing the origin, yields 4π. This problem is mathematically analogous to using Gauss's Law in electrostatics to find the flux from a point charge at the origin.\n\nThus, the value of the integral is 4π.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 0\n\nThe most appropriate answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
