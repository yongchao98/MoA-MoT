    "The reaction of an aryl halide with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through a highly reactive benzyne intermediate. Let's analyze the specific case of 1-bromobenzene-2-d.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThe bond to hydrogen (C-H) is weaker than the bond to deuterium (C-D). Because of this kinetic isotope effect, it is easier and faster for the base to remove the hydrogen at position 6 than the deuterium at position 2. This leads to two possible competing elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Major Pathway:** The amide ion abstracts the hydrogen from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 creates a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n2.  **Minor Pathway:** Less frequently, the amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion, attacks the reactive \"triple\" bond of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (Major pathway):**\n    *   The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (Minor pathway):**\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate.\n    *   The resulting product is simply **aniline**, containing no deuterium.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nConsidering both the major and minor pathways, three distinct organic products are possible:\n\n1.  2-Deuteroaniline\n2.  3-Deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
