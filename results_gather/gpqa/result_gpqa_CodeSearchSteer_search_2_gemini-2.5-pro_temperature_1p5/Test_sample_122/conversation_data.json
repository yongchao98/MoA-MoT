    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. To find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame, we must first determine the time elapsed in that frame.\n\n### 1. Identify Given Information\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper time (t₀):** 50 s (time passed in the ejecta's moving frame).\n*   **Speed of light (c):** Approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. Time Dilation\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame of reference will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect, known as time dilation, means that the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`t`) will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`t = γ * t₀`\n\nwhere `t` is the time in the stationary observer's frame (the Galaxy), `t₀` is the proper time in the moving frame (the ejecta), and `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, we can calculate `γ`:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n### 4. Calculate Time in the Galaxy's Frame (t)\nNow, use the time dilation formula:\n`t = γ * t₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\nSo, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, about 51.03 seconds pass in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame\nFinally, calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame using the formula `distance = speed × time`.\n`Distance = v * t`\n`Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\nAlternatively, a more precise calculation without intermediate rounding:\n`Distance = v * (γ * t₀) = 60,000 km/s * (1 / √0.96) * 50 s`\n`Distance = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is very close to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
