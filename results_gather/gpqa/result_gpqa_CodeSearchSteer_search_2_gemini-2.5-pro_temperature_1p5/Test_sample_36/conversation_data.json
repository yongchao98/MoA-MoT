    "The analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's structure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    This reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) as a thioacetal using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT). The product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the acidic proton at the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2). This forms a lithiated carbanion, B, which is a potent nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position. The resulting product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    This step is the deprotection of the thioacetal. The 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl compound. The product, D, is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) react to form a phosphonium salt.\n    *   BuLi deprotonates the salt to create the Wittig ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   This ylide reacts with the ketone from step 4, 3-pentanone. The C=O of the ketone and the C=P of the ylide are replaced by a C=C double bond.\n    *   The final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E:**\n\nThe final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is a highly symmetrical molecule. Due to this symmetry, several carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and will produce a single signal in the 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃\n         /\n    CH₃CH₂-C=C-CH₂CH₃\n           \\\n            CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Equivalent Carbons:**\n    1.  The two central carbons of the double bond (C=C) are in identical chemical environments and are therefore equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n    2.  All four methylene groups (-CH₂-) are attached to the double bond carbons and are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This gives a **second signal**.\n    3.  All four methyl groups (-CH₃-) at the ends of the ethyl chains are also equivalent by symmetry. This gives a **third signal**.\n\nTherefore, despite having a total of 12 carbon atoms, the high degree of symmetry in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene results in only three distinct signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
