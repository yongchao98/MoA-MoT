To find its eigenvalues, we must understand each component:\n    *   **$\\varepsilon$**: A scalar constant with the dimension of energy. This is a critical clue, as it implies the eigenvalues, which represent the system's energy levels, must be directly proportional to $\\varepsilon$.\n    *   **$\\vec{\\sigma}$**: The vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are fundamental 2x2 matrices that describe the spin of a spin-1/2 particle.\n    *   **$\\vec{n}$**: An arbitrary **unit vector**. This condition is essential, as it means the magnitude of the vector is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Derivation Methods:**\n    The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the correct methods to solve this problem. All valid methods lead to the same result. The two most common and elegant approaches are:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian (Algebraic Approach).**\n        This is the most common method presented.\n        1.  We square the Hamiltonian operator: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        2.  A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices states that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n        3.  In our case, the vector is the unit vector $\\vec{n}$. Since $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$, the identity simplifies to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (1)I = I$.\n        4.  Therefore, the square of the Hamiltonian is simply $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n        5.  If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ must be an eigenvalue of $H^2$. This leads to the equation $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n        6.  Solving for $\\lambda$ gives the two eigenvalues: $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Simplification by Coordinate Rotation (Geometric Approach).**\n        This method uses the physical principle that eigenvalues are independent of the chosen coordinate system.\n        1.  We can simplify the problem by choosing a coordinate system where the z-axis aligns with the vector $\\vec{n}$. In this frame, $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n        2.  The Hamiltonian becomes $H = \\varepsilon(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}) = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z$.\n        3.  In matrix form, $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        4.  The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, which are clearly $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n    All valid methods unanimously and robustly show that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Role of the Energy Constant $\\varepsilon$**: The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ has dimensionless eigenvalues of $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must be $\\varepsilon \\times (\\pm 1) = \\pm \\varepsilon$. This immediately rules out options C) and D), which lack the $\\varepsilon$ factor.\n*   **The Absence of Planck's Constant $\\hbar$**: The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined in terms of the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. The eigenvalues of spin components like $S_z$ are $\\pm \\hbar/2$. Since $\\hbar$ is not part of the given Hamiltonian, it cannot appear in the eigenvalues. This is a crucial distinction that rules out options A) and C).\n*   **The Unit Vector Condition**: The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector ($|\\vec{n}|=1$) is essential for the result. All valid derivations rely on this fact to simplify the expressions.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers**: The reasoning and mathematical derivation in all 15 candidate answers are correct and lead to the result $\\pm \\varepsilon$. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, D) indicates that the agents were likely working with differently ordered lists of options. The correct approach is to trust the unanimous derivation and map it to the specific options provided in this question.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe derived eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. Comparing this result with the provided options:\n\n*   A) $+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2$: Incorrect. Contains an extraneous factor of $\\hbar/2$.\n*   B) + \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon: **Correct.** This perfectly matches the derived result.\n*   C) +\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2: Incorrect. These are the eigenvalues of a spin component operator like $S_z$, not this Hamiltonian. It is missing $\\varepsilon$ and incorrectly includes $\\hbar$.\n*   D) +1, -1: Incorrect. These are the eigenvalues of $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$, missing the energy scaling factor $\\varepsilon$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, the following is a definitive step-by-step evaluation of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Hamiltonian Operator**\n    The problem asks for the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. To find these, we must understand each component:\n    *   **$\\varepsilon$**: A scalar constant with the dimension of energy. This is a critical clue, as it implies the eigenvalues, which represent the system's possible energy levels, must be directly proportional to $\\varepsilon$.\n    *   **$\\vec{\\sigma}$**: The vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are fundamental 2x2 matrices that describe the spin of a spin-1/2 particle.\n    *   **$\\vec{n}$**: An arbitrary **unit vector**. This condition is essential, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ represents a measurement of spin along the direction of $\\vec{n}$.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Derivation Methods**\n    The candidate answers show a strong consensus on two primary, valid methods for solving this problem. Both lead to the same result.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian (Algebraic Approach)**\n        This is the most common and elegant method. If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of H, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of HÂ².\n        1.  First, we square the Hamiltonian operator: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        2.  A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices states that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n        3.  In our case, the vector is the unit vector $\\vec{n}$. Since $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$, the identity simplifies to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (1)I = I$.\n        4.  Substituting this back, we find the square of the Hamiltonian is simply $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n        5.  The eigenvalues of $H^2$ must therefore be $\\varepsilon^2$. This means $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n        6.  Taking the square root gives the two eigenvalues of H: $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Coordinate System Rotation (Geometric Approach)**\n        The eigenvalues of an operator are a physical property and thus do not depend on the coordinate system chosen to represent it.\n        1.  We can simplify the problem by choosing a coordinate system where the z-axis aligns with the vector $\\vec{n}$. In this frame, $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n        2.  The dot product becomes $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n} = \\sigma_x n_x + \\sigma_y n_y + \\sigma_z n_z = \\sigma_z$.\n        3.  The Hamiltonian simplifies to $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z$.\n        4.  The matrix for $\\sigma_z$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, so the Hamiltonian matrix is $H = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        5.  The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements. Thus, the eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion of Analysis**\n    Both methods robustly and unambiguously show that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Role of the Energy Scale $\\varepsilon$**: The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ is dimensionless and has eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ scales this operator by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, its eigenvalues must be $\\pm \\varepsilon$. This point alone rules out options A and C.\n*   **The Absence of Planck's Constant $\\hbar$**: The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined in terms of the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since $\\hbar$ is not part of the given Hamiltonian, it cannot appear in the eigenvalues. This is a common pitfall. This point rules out options A and B.\n*   **The Unit Vector Condition**: The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector ($|\\vec{n}|^2=1$) is essential for the result. All valid derivations rely on this fact to simplify the expressions. If $\\vec{n}$ were not a unit vector, the eigenvalues would be $\\pm \\varepsilon |\\vec{n}|$.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly perform the physical and mathematical derivation, arriving at the result $\\pm \\varepsilon$. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is an artifact of them being presented with differently ordered lists of options and should be disregarded. The physical reasoning is unanimous and correct.\n\nBy combining the process of elimination from the careful points with the direct derivation, we can confidently select the correct option. The eigenvalues must be proportional to $\\varepsilon$ and must not contain $\\hbar$.\n\nComparing the derived result, $\\pm \\varepsilon$, with the provided options:\n*   A) $+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2$: Incorrect. Contains $\\hbar$ and is missing $\\varepsilon$.\n*   B) $+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2$: Incorrect. Contains an extraneous factor of $\\hbar/2$.\n*   C) +1, -1: Incorrect. These are the eigenvalues of $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$, but are missing the energy scaling factor $\\varepsilon$.\n*   D) + \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon: **Correct.** This perfectly matches the derived result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the problem and the reasoning provided in the candidate answers. I will synthesize the unanimous physical and mathematical derivation to establish the correct result. Then, I will list the key \"careful points\" that allow for a process of elimination among the given options. Finally, I will combine the direct derivation with the process of elimination to select the correct answer from the specific list provided in the prompt.\n\nHere are the thinking steps:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Hamiltonian**: I will break down the Hamiltonian $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ into its components: the energy constant $\\varepsilon$, the Pauli vector $\\vec{\\sigma}$, and the unit vector $\\vec{n}$. This clarifies the role of each part and the expected form of the answer.\n2.  **Synthesize the Derivation**: The most robust method, used by all candidates, is squaring the Hamiltonian. I will follow this logic:\n    *   Calculate $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n    *   Use the known identity for Pauli matrices, $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 I$.\n    *   Apply the condition that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector ($|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$), which simplifies the identity to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.\n    *   This leads to $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n    *   If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $H^2$. Therefore, $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, which means the eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n3.  **Analyze the Options via Elimination**: I will check the given options against the physics of the problem.\n    *   The eigenvalues must have units of energy, so they must be proportional to $\\varepsilon$. This eliminates options without $\\varepsilon$.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is defined with $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Therefore, Planck's constant $\\hbar$ should not appear in the answer. This eliminates options with $\\hbar$.\n4.  **Final Decision**: I will compare the result from the derivation ($\\pm \\varepsilon$) with the options remaining after elimination to make a final choice and present it in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_quantum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function programmatically follows the logical steps to determine the\n    eigenvalues of the given Hamiltonian and select the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the problem and options\n    question = \"What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = Îµ * Ï.n?\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"+Îµ Ä§/2, -Îµ Ä§/2\",\n        \"B\": \"+Ä§/2, -Ä§/2\",\n        \"C\": \"+Îµ, -Îµ\",\n        \"D\": \"+1, -1\"\n    }\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n    print(\"Options:\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}) {value}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Follow the physical derivation\n    print(\"\\n--- Step-by-step Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"1.

We square the Hamiltonian operator: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        2.

The two most common and insightful methods are:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian (Algebraic Approach)**\n        This is the most common method used by the agents.\n        1.  Square the Hamiltonian: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        2.  Use the fundamental identity of Pauli matrices: $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n        3.  In our case, $\\vec{A} = \\vec{n}$.

We square the operator: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        2.  A fundamental identity of Pauli matrices is that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n        3.

The eigenvalues of the components of $\\vec{S}$ (e.g., $S_z$) are $\\pm \\hbar/2$. However, the Hamiltonian in this question is explicitly defined in terms of $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not $\\vec{S}$.

If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of H, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of HÂ².\n        1.  First, we square the Hamiltonian operator: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        2.

We can simplify the problem by choosing a coordinate system where the z-axis aligns with the vector $\\vec{n}$. In this frame, $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n        2.

I will synthesize the unanimous physical and mathematical derivation to establish the correct result. Then, I will list the key \"careful points\" that allow for a process of elimination among the given options. Finally, I will combine the direct derivation with the process of elimination to select the correct answer from the specific list provided in the prompt.\n\nHere are the thinking steps:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Hamiltonian**: I will break down the Hamiltonian $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ into its components: the energy constant $\\varepsilon$, the Pauli vector $\\vec{\\sigma}$, and the unit vector $\\vec{n}$. This clarifies the role of each part and the expected form of the answer.\n2.  **Synthesize the Derivation**: The most robust method, used by all candidates, is squaring the Hamiltonian. I will follow this logic:\n    *   Calculate $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n    *   Use the known identity for Pauli matrices, $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 I$.\n    *   Apply the condition that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector ($|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$), which simplifies the identity to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.\n    *   This leads to $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n    *   If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $H^2$. Therefore, $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, which means the eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n3.  **Analyze the Options via Elimination**: I will check the given options against the physics of the problem.\n    *   The eigenvalues must have units of energy, so they must be proportional to $\\varepsilon$. This eliminates options without $\\varepsilon$.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is defined with $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Therefore, Planck's constant $\\hbar$ should not appear in the answer. This eliminates options with $\\hbar$.\n4.  **Final Decision**: I will compare the result from the derivation ($\\pm \\varepsilon$) with the options remaining after elimination to make a final choice and present it in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_quantum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function programmatically follows the logical steps to determine the\n    eigenvalues of the given Hamiltonian and select the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the problem and options\n    question = \"What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = Îµ * Ï.n?\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"+Îµ Ä§/2, -Îµ Ä§/2\",\n        \"B\": \"+Ä§/2, -Ä§/2\",\n        \"C\": \"+Îµ, -Îµ\",\n        \"D\": \"+1, -1\"\n    }\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n    print(\"Options:\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}) {value}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Follow the physical derivation\n    print(\"\\n--- Step-by-step Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"1.

To find these, we must understand each component:\n    *   **$\\varepsilon$**: A scalar constant with the dimension of energy. This is a critical clue, as it implies the eigenvalues, which represent the system's possible energy levels, must be directly proportional to $\\varepsilon$.\n    *   **$\\vec{\\sigma}$**: The vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are fundamental 2x2 matrices in quantum mechanics that describe the spin of a spin-1/2 particle.\n    *   **$\\vec{n}$**: An arbitrary **unit vector**. This condition is essential, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Derivation Methods:**\n    The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the correct methods to solve this problem. All valid methods lead to the same result. The two most common and elegant approaches are:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian (Algebraic Approach)**\n        This is the most common method used by the agents.\n        1.  We square the Hamiltonian operator: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        2.  We use the fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices: $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{B}) = (\\vec{A}.\\vec{B})I + i\\vec{\\sigma}.(\\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B})$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n        3.  By setting $\\vec{A} = \\vec{B} = \\vec{n}$, the identity becomes: $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{n}.\\vec{n})I + i\\vec{\\sigma}.(\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$.\n        4.  Using the properties of the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ (namely $\\vec{n}.\\vec{n} = |\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$ and the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n} = \\vec{0}$), the identity simplifies dramatically to: $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (1)I + \\vec{0} = I$.\n        5.  Therefore, the square of the Hamiltonian is simply $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n        6.  If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ must be an eigenvalue of $H^2$. This leads to the equation $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n        7.  Solving for $\\lambda$ gives the two eigenvalues: $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Simplification by Coordinate Rotation (Geometric Approach)**\n        This method uses the physical insight that eigenvalues are independent of the chosen coordinate system.\n        1.  We can simplify the problem by choosing a coordinate system where the z-axis aligns with the vector $\\vec{n}$. In this system, $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n        2.  The Hamiltonian simplifies to $H = \\varepsilon(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}) = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z$.\n        3.  In matrix form, $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        4.  The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, which are clearly $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion of Derivations:**\n    All valid methods unanimously and robustly conclude that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Role of the Energy Constant $\\varepsilon$**: The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ has dimensionless eigenvalues of $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This immediately rules out options A) and D).\n*   **The Absence of Planck's Constant $\\hbar$**: The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined in terms of the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. The eigenvalues of spin components like $S_z$ are $\\pm \\hbar/2$. Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not part of the given Hamiltonian, it cannot appear in the eigenvalues. This is a crucial distinction and a common pitfall. This rules out options A) and B).\n*   **The Unit Vector Condition**: The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector ($|\\vec{n}|=1$) is essential for the result. All valid derivations rely on this fact to simplify $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$ to the identity matrix.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Reasoning**: All candidate answers correctly perform the physical and mathematical derivation, arriving at the result $\\pm \\varepsilon$. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, D) is due to the agents being presented with differently ordered lists of options, not an error in their reasoning.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe step-by-step analysis and the careful points confirm that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.

We square the Hamiltonian operator: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        2.  A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices states that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n        3.  In our case, the vector is the unit vector $\\vec{n}$. Since $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$, the identity simplifies to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (1)I = I$.\n        4.  Therefore, the square of the Hamiltonian is simply $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n        5.  If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ must be an eigenvalue of $H^2$. This leads to the equation $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n        6.

This is a critical clue, as it implies the eigenvalues, which represent the system's possible energy levels, must be directly proportional to $\\varepsilon$.\n    *   **$\\vec{\\sigma}$**: The vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are fundamental 2x2 matrices that describe the spin of a spin-1/2 particle.\n    *   **$\\vec{n}$**: An arbitrary **unit vector**. This condition is essential, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ represents a spin measurement along the arbitrary direction defined by $\\vec{n}$.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Derivation Methods:**\n    The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the correct methods to solve this problem. All valid methods lead to the same result. The two most common and insightful approaches are:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian (Algebraic Approach)**\n        This is the most common and elegant method.\n        1.  We square the Hamiltonian operator: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        2.  A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices states that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n        3.  In our case, the vector is the unit vector $\\vec{n}$. Since $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$, the identity simplifies to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.\n        4.  Therefore, the square of the Hamiltonian is simply $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n        5.  If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ must be an eigenvalue of $H^2$. This leads to the equation $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n        6.  Solving for $\\lambda$ gives the two eigenvalues: $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Simplification by Coordinate Rotation (Geometric Approach)**\n        This method uses the physical principle that eigenvalues are independent of the chosen coordinate system.\n        1.  We can simplify the problem by choosing a coordinate system where the z-axis aligns with the vector $\\vec{n}$. In this frame, $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n        2.  The Hamiltonian becomes $H = \\varepsilon(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}) = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z$.\n        3.  In matrix form, $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        4.  The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, which are clearly $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n    All valid methods unanimously and robustly show that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Role of the Energy Constant $\\varepsilon$**: The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ has dimensionless eigenvalues of $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ scales this operator by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This immediately rules out options C) `+1, -1` and D) `+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2`.\n*   **The Absence of Planck's Constant $\\hbar$**: The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined in terms of the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. The eigenvalues of spin components like $S_z$ are $\\pm \\hbar/2$. Since $\\hbar$ is not part of the given Hamiltonian, it cannot appear in the eigenvalues. This is a crucial distinction that rules out options B) `+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2` and D) `+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2`.\n*   **The Unit Vector Condition**: The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector ($|\\vec{n}|=1$) is essential for the result. All valid derivations rely on this fact to simplify the expressions. If $\\vec{n}$ were not a unit vector, the eigenvalues would be $\\pm \\varepsilon |\\vec{n}|$.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the physical and mathematical derivation, arriving at the result $\\pm \\varepsilon$. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, D) is an artifact of them being presented with differently ordered lists of options and does not reflect any error in their reasoning. The physical conclusion is unanimous.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe step-by-step analysis and the process of elimination based on the careful points both lead to the same unambiguous result.

To find its eigenvalues, we must understand each component:\n    *   **$\\varepsilon$**: A scalar constant with the dimension of energy. This acts as a scaling factor. The eigenvalues, which represent the possible energy measurements of the system, must be directly proportional to $\\varepsilon$.\n    *   **$\\vec{\\sigma}$**: The vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are the fundamental 2x2 matrix operators for a spin-1/2 system.\n    *   **$\\vec{n}$**: An arbitrary **unit vector**. This is a critical condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Derivation Methods:**\n    The candidate answers show a strong consensus on two primary, valid methods for solving this problem. Both lead to the same result.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian (Algebraic Approach)**\n        This is the most common and elegant method. If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of H, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $H^2$.\n        *   First, we square the Hamiltonian operator: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        *   A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices states that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n        *   In our case, the vector is the unit vector $\\vec{n}$. Since $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$, the identity simplifies to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (1)I = I$.\n        *   Substituting this back, we find $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n        *   Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H^2$ are $\\varepsilon^2$. This means $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n        *   Taking the square root gives the two eigenvalues of H: $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Coordinate System Rotation (Geometric Approach)**\n        The eigenvalues of an operator are independent of the coordinate system chosen.\n        *   We can simplify the problem by choosing a coordinate system where the z-axis aligns with the vector $\\vec{n}$. In this frame, $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n        *   The dot product becomes $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n} = \\sigma_x n_x + \\sigma_y n_y + \\sigma_z n_z = \\sigma_z$.\n        *   The Hamiltonian simplifies to $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z$.\n        *   The matrix for $\\sigma_z$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, so the Hamiltonian matrix is $H = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        *   The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements. Thus, the eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n    Both methods robustly and unambiguously show that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Role of the Energy Scale $\\varepsilon$**: The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ has dimensionless eigenvalues of $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ scales this operator by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, its eigenvalues must be proportional to $\\varepsilon$. This point alone rules out options A (+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2) and D (+1, -1).\n*   **The Absence of Planck's Constant $\\hbar$**: The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined in terms of the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since $\\hbar$ is not part of the given Hamiltonian, it cannot appear in the eigenvalues. This is a common pitfall. This point rules out options A (+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2) and B (+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2).\n*   **The Unit Vector Condition**: The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector is essential for the result. All valid derivations rely on this fact ($|\\vec{n}|^2=1$) to simplify the expressions.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the physical and mathematical derivation, arriving at the result $\\pm \\varepsilon$. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to the agents being presented with differently ordered lists of options and should be disregarded.

Square the Hamiltonian: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        2.  Use the fundamental identity of Pauli matrices: $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n        3.  In our case, $\\vec{A} = \\vec{n}$. Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, its magnitude squared is one: $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\n        4.  The identity simplifies to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.\n        5.  Therefore, the square of the Hamiltonian is simply $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n        6.  This implies that the eigenvalues of $H^2$ are $\\varepsilon^2$. So, we must have $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n        7.  Solving for $\\lambda$ gives the two eigenvalues: $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Coordinate Rotation (Geometric Approach)**\n        The eigenvalues of an operator are a physical property and thus independent of the coordinate system chosen to represent it.\n        1.  We can simplify the problem by choosing a coordinate system where the z-axis aligns with the vector $\\vec{n}$. In this system, $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n        2.  The Hamiltonian becomes $H = \\varepsilon (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}) = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z$.\n        3.  The matrix for $\\sigma_z$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, so the Hamiltonian matrix is $H = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        4.  The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, which are clearly $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Role of the Energy Constant $\\varepsilon$**: The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ is dimensionless and has eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ scales this operator by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must be scaled by $\\varepsilon$.
