What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n\nA) 9.54 Angstrom\nB) 10.05 Angstrom\nC) 9.08 Angstrom\nD) 8.95 Angstrom\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the best methods and careful points from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Given Information and Goal\nThe problem requires the calculation of the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter `a`:** 10 Angstrom (The \"interatomic distance\" is interpreted as the lattice constant `a`, where the primitive lattice vectors have equal length).\n*   **Interaxial Angles `α`, `β`, `γ`:** All are equal to 30°.\n*   **Miller Indices `(hkl)`:** (111)\n\n### Step 2: Select the Correct Formula\nThe first and most critical step is to use the correct formula for the interplanar spacing, `d_hkl`, in a rhombohedral crystal system. This formula, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation using the Most Robust Method\nThe general formula is complex and substituting all numerical values at once is prone to rounding errors. The most reliable method, highlighted by the best candidate answers, is to first simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane where `h=k=l=1`.\n\n1.  **Simplify the Formula:** For the (111) plane, `h² + k² + l² = 3` and `hk + kl + lh = 3`. Substituting these values and performing algebraic and trigonometric simplification leads to a much simpler and more robust expression:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    Using this simplified formula is the best practice as it minimizes the potential for calculation errors.\n\n2.  **Substitute Numerical Values:** Now, we substitute the given values (`a = 10` Å and `α = 30°`) into this simplified formula. To ensure accuracy, it is best to use the exact value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n3.  **Solve for d_111:** Invert the equation and take the square root.\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n    Rounding to two decimal places gives **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\n### Careful Points\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, several points are crucial for arriving at the correct solution:\n\n1.  **Formula Selection:** It is essential to use the specific formula for the rhombohedral crystal system. Using a formula for a different system (e.g., cubic, hexagonal) would be incorrect.\n2.  **Formula Simplification:** The most robust approach is to simplify the general formula for the specific (111) plane *before* substituting numerical values. This significantly reduces the complexity of the calculation and minimizes the potential for rounding errors.\n3.  **Calculation Precision:** There is an overwhelming consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the numerical result being ~9.54 Å. To ensure this accuracy, it is best to use exact values (like `√3/2`) for trigonometric functions until the final step.\n4.  **Option Matching:** This was the most significant point of failure among the candidate answers. While nearly all of them correctly calculated the numerical value, their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) were inconsistent. This strongly indicates that the options were presented to them in a shuffled order. Therefore, the crucial final step is to ignore the letter choices of the candidates and match the correct numerical result (9.54 Å) to the specific option list provided in the original question.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation consistently and accurately yields an interplanar distance of approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. Comparing this result to the options provided in the original question:\n\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 9.54 Angstrom\nC) 9.08 Angstrom\nD) 10.05 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value directly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the best methods and careful points from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Given Information and Goal\nThe problem requires the calculation of the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are:\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter `a`:** 10 Angstrom (The \"interatomic distance\" is interpreted as the lattice constant `a`, where the primitive lattice vectors have equal length).\n*   **Interaxial Angles `α`, `β`, `γ`:** All are equal to 30°.\n*   **Miller Indices `(hkl)`:** (111)\n\n### Step 2: Select the Correct Formula\nThe first and most critical step is to use the correct formula for the interplanar spacing, `d_hkl`, in a rhombohedral crystal system. This formula, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation using the Most Robust Method\nThere is an overwhelming consensus among all candidate answers on the numerical result. The most reliable method, which avoids potential rounding errors from the complex general formula, is to first simplify it for the specific case of the (111) plane.\n\n1.  **Substitute Miller Indices:** For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n    *   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\n2.  **Simplify the Formula:** Substituting these values and performing algebraic and trigonometric simplification leads to a much simpler and more robust expression for the (111) plane:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n3.  **Substitute Numerical Values:** Now, we substitute the given values (`a = 10` Å and `α = 30°`) into this simplified formula. For maximum precision, we use the exact value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n4.  **Solve for d_111:** Invert the equation and take the square root.\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n### Careful Points\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, several points require careful attention to ensure the correct answer is reached:\n\n1.  **Formula Selection:** It is essential to use the specific formula for the rhombohedral crystal system. Using a formula for a different, simpler system (like cubic) would lead to a completely incorrect answer.\n2.  **Algebraic Simplification:** For high-symmetry planes like (111), the general formula can be simplified. As shown in Step 3, doing so is the most robust method as it significantly reduces the number of terms and minimizes the potential for calculation and rounding errors. This was a key insight from the best candidate answers.\n3.  **Calculation Precision:** When performing the calculation, it is best practice to use exact values for trigonometric functions (e.g., `cos(30°) = √3/2`) as long as possible. Prematurely rounding these values to decimals can introduce small errors.\n4.  **Option Matching:** This was the most common point of failure among the candidate answers. There was a strong consensus on the numerical result (~9.54 Å), but many agents selected the wrong lettered option. This was because the options were presented to them in a shuffled order. It is critical to match the final calculated value to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation consistently and accurately yields an interplanar distance of approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. Comparing this result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 9.54 Angstrom\nB) 9.08 Angstrom\nC) 8.95 Angstrom\nD) 10.05 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants me to act as an AI assistant, analyze a set of 15 candidate answers to a physics problem, and produce a single, definitive solution. The solution must be presented as Python code in a single block, preceded by a step-by-step plan. The final choice must be clearly stated at the end.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Candidate Answers:** I will review all 15 provided answers to identify common patterns, correct methods, and potential pitfalls.\n    *   **Universal Agreement:** All candidates correctly identify the problem as calculating the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. They all use the same, correct, general formula.\n    *   **Numerical Consensus:** There is an overwhelming consensus that the numerical answer is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. Minor variations (e.g., 9.543 vs. 9.526) can be attributed to rounding differences in intermediate steps.\n    *   **Methodological Insight (The \"Best Practice\"):** The most reliable answers highlight a crucial step: for the specific (111) plane, the complex general formula can be algebraically simplified to a much more robust and error-proof version. This is the best method to use.\n    *   **Primary Source of Error:** The final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent across the board, despite the numerical agreement. This strongly suggests that the options were shuffled for each agent. Therefore, I must ignore the letter choices from the candidates and match my calculated numerical result to the original list of options provided in the prompt.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Step-by-Step Plan:** Based on the synthesis, I will create a clear plan for my own solution.\n    *   **Step 1: State the Goal and Parameters.** Clearly define what needs to be calculated and list the given values (`a` = 10 Å, `α` = 30°, plane = (111)).\n    *   **Step 2: Select the Optimal Formula.** I will state the general formula for completeness but immediately pivot to the simplified formula for the (111) plane, explaining that this is the most accurate method. The simplified formula is `1/d² = 3 / (a² * (1 + 2*cos(α)))`.\n    *   **Step 3: Implement the Calculation in Python.** I will write a Python script to perform the calculation. This ensures high precision and removes any chance of manual arithmetic error. The script will define the parameters, convert the angle to radians, apply the simplified formula, and calculate the final value for `d`.\n    *   **Step 4: Compare and Conclude.** The script will print the calculated value. It will then display the original, unshuffled options from the user's prompt and programmatically determine which option is the closest match. This provides a definitive link between the calculation and the final answer.\n\n4.  **Construct the Final Response:** I will write the introductory text explaining my plan, followed by the Python code block. The code will execute the plan, printing out each step of its logic. Finally, based on the code's output, I will provide the final answer in the required `<<<C>>>` format. The calculation `sqrt((10^2 * (1 + 2 * cos(30°))) / 3)` yields approximately 9.543, which clearly matches the option \"9.54 Angstrom\".\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the final answer is not just a guess based on the majority, but a verified result derived from the best practices identified across all candidate solutions, while carefully avoiding the primary pitfall (shuffled options) that tripped up the other agents.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.

Using a formula for a different system (like cubic or tetragonal) would lead to a completely incorrect result.\n2.  **Algebraic Simplification**: For high-symmetry planes like (111), the general formula can often be simplified. As shown in Step 3, doing so is the most robust method as it significantly reduces the number of terms and minimizes the potential for calculation and rounding errors.

For maximum precision, we use the exact value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n4.  **Solve for d_111:** Invert the equation and take the square root.\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n### Careful Points\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, several points require careful attention to ensure the correct answer is reached:\n\n1.  **Formula Selection:** It is essential to use the specific formula for the rhombohedral crystal system. Using a formula for a different, simpler system (like cubic) would lead to a completely incorrect answer.\n2.  **Algebraic Simplification:** For high-symmetry planes like (111), the general formula can be simplified. As shown in Step 3, doing so is the most robust method as it significantly reduces the number of terms and minimizes the potential for calculation and rounding errors. This was a key insight from the best candidate answers.\n3.  **Calculation Precision:** When performing the calculation, it is best practice to use exact values for trigonometric functions (e.g., `cos(30°) = √3/2`) as long as possible. Prematurely rounding these values to decimals can introduce small errors.\n4.  **Option Matching:** This was the most common point of failure among the candidate answers. There was a strong consensus on the numerical result (~9.54 Å), but many agents selected the wrong lettered option. This was because the options were presented to them in a shuffled order. It is critical to match the final calculated value to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation consistently and accurately yields an interplanar distance of approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. Comparing this result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 9.54 Angstrom\nB) 9.08 Angstrom\nC) 8.95 Angstrom\nD) 10.05 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants me to act as an AI assistant, analyze a set of 15 candidate answers to a physics problem, and produce a single, definitive solution. The solution must be presented as Python code in a single block, preceded by a step-by-step plan. The final choice must be clearly stated at the end.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Candidate Answers:** I will review all 15 provided answers to identify common patterns, correct methods, and potential pitfalls.\n    *   **Universal Agreement:** All candidates correctly identify the problem as calculating the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. They all use the same, correct, general formula.\n    *   **Numerical Consensus:** There is an overwhelming consensus that the numerical answer is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. Minor variations (e.g., 9.543 vs. 9.526) can be attributed to rounding differences in intermediate steps.\n    *   **Methodological Insight (The \"Best Practice\"):** The most reliable answers highlight a crucial step: for the specific (111) plane, the complex general formula can be algebraically simplified to a much more robust and error-proof version. This is the best method to use.\n    *   **Primary Source of Error:** The final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent across the board, despite the numerical agreement. This strongly suggests that the options were shuffled for each agent. Therefore, I must ignore the letter choices from the candidates and match my calculated numerical result to the original list of options provided in the prompt.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Step-by-Step Plan:** Based on the synthesis, I will create a clear plan for my own solution.\n    *   **Step 1: State the Goal and Parameters.** Clearly define what needs to be calculated and list the given values (`a` = 10 Å, `α` = 30°, plane = (111)).\n    *   **Step 2: Select the Optimal Formula.** I will state the general formula for completeness but immediately pivot to the simplified formula for the (111) plane, explaining that this is the most accurate method. The simplified formula is `1/d² = 3 / (a² * (1 + 2*cos(α)))`.\n    *   **Step 3: Implement the Calculation in Python.** I will write a Python script to perform the calculation. This ensures high precision and removes any chance of manual arithmetic error. The script will define the parameters, convert the angle to radians, apply the simplified formula, and calculate the final value for `d`.\n    *   **Step 4: Compare and Conclude.** The script will print the calculated value. It will then display the original, unshuffled options from the user's prompt and programmatically determine which option is the closest match. This provides a definitive link between the calculation and the final answer.\n\n4.  **Construct the Final Response:** I will write the introductory text explaining my plan, followed by the Python code block. The code will execute the plan, printing out each step of its logic. Finally, based on the code's output, I will provide the final answer in the required `<<<C>>>` format. The calculation `sqrt((10^2 * (1 + 2 * cos(30°))) / 3)` yields approximately 9.543, which clearly matches the option \"9.54 Angstrom\".\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the final answer is not just a guess based on the majority, but a verified result derived from the best practices identified across all candidate solutions, while carefully avoiding the primary pitfall (shuffled options) that tripped up the other agents.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.

The given parameters are:\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter `a`:** 10 Angstrom (The \"interatomic distance\" is interpreted as the lattice constant `a`, where the primitive lattice vectors have equal length).\n*   **Interaxial Angles `α`, `β`, `γ`:** All are equal to 30°.\n*   **Miller Indices `(hkl)`:** (111)\n\n### Step 2: Select the Correct Formula\nThe first and most critical step is to use the correct formula for the interplanar spacing, `d_hkl`, in a rhombohedral crystal system. This formula is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nThis formula was correctly identified by the candidate answers and is confirmed by crystallography resources.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation using the Most Robust Method\nThere is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on the numerical result. The most reliable path to this result involves simplifying the formula before calculation.\n\nFor the specific case of the (111) plane, where `h=k=l=1`:\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstituting these values and performing algebraic and trigonometric simplification leads to a much simpler and more accurate expression for the (111) plane:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\nUsing this simplified formula is the best practice as it minimizes the potential for calculation errors. Now, we substitute the given values, using the exact value for `cos(30°) = √3 / 2` to maintain precision:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\nSolving for `d_111`:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\nFinally, calculating the numerical value using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\nRounding to two decimal places gives **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\n### Careful Points\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, several points are crucial for arriving at the correct solution:\n1.  **Formula Selection**: It is essential to use the specific, and rather complex, formula for the rhombohedral crystal system. Using a simpler formula for a different crystal system (like cubic or tetragonal) would lead to a completely incorrect answer.\n2.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The general formula is complex. For high-symmetry planes like (111), it simplifies significantly. Using this simplified version is the most robust method as it drastically reduces the number of terms and the potential for rounding errors. This was a key step in the most reliable candidate answers.\n3.  **Calculation Precision**: To ensure an accurate result, it is best to use exact values for trigonometric functions (e.g., `√3/2` for `cos(30°)`) until the final step. Prematurely rounding these values can introduce small but significant inaccuracies.\n4.  **Option Matching**: This was the most significant point of failure among the candidate answers. There is an overwhelming consensus that the numerical value is ~9.54 Angstrom. However, the final letter choice varied widely. This indicates that the agents were likely presented with shuffled lists of options. The crucial final step is to match the calculated value to the options as they were presented in the original question.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation consistently and accurately yields an interplanar distance of approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. Comparing this result to the original options provided in the question:\n\nA) 9.08 Angstrom\nB) 9.54 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 8.95 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value directly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Consensus Among Agents\n\nA thorough review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the core physics and mathematics of the problem.\n*   **Given Information:** All agents correctly identified the crystal system as rhombohedral, the lattice parameter `a` as 10 Angstrom, the interaxial angle `α` as 30°, and the Miller indices `(hkl)` as (111).\n*   **Correct Formula:** All agents unanimously selected the correct, albeit complex, formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n*   **Numerical Result:** There is an overwhelming agreement that the final calculated value is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**. Minor differences in the third or fourth decimal place (e.g., 9.543 Å vs. 9.526 Å) are attributable to different rounding practices but do not change the result when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Best Methodology and Careful Points\n\nThe most reliable agents highlighted several \"careful points\" that are crucial for accuracy.\n\n1.  **Formula Simplification:** The most robust method is to simplify the general formula for the specific (111) plane *before* substituting numerical values. Since `h=k=l=1`, the formula simplifies significantly to:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    This approach, used by the best agents, minimizes the number of terms and drastically reduces the chance of calculation or rounding errors.\n\n2.  **Calculation Precision:** To ensure accuracy, it is best to use exact values for trigonometric functions (i.e., `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`) throughout the algebraic manipulation and only perform the numerical calculation at the final step.\n\n3.  **Resolving the Discrepancy:** The primary source of disagreement among the agents is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). The agents themselves correctly diagnose this issue, noting that the options were likely presented to them in a shuffled order. For example, different agents report that 9.54 Angstrom corresponds to options A, B, C, and D. Therefore, the letter choices of the individual agents must be disregarded.\n\n### Step 3: Final Calculation and Decision\n\nFollowing the best practices identified, we confirm the numerical result.\n1.  Use the simplified formula: `1/d_111^2 = 3 / (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(α)))`\n2.  Substitute the values: `a = 10` and `α = 30°`.\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{10^2 (1 + 2\\cos(30^\\circ))}{3} = \\frac{100 (1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3} = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n3.  Calculate the final value:\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (2.732)}{3}} \\approx \\sqrt{91.067} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\nThe calculated interplanar distance is **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\nThe final step is to match this confirmed numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the original question prompt.\n\n**Question's Options:**\nA) 10.05 Angstrom\nB) 9.54 Angstrom\nC) 8.95 Angstrom\nD) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom directly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the best methods and careful points from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Given Information and Goal\nThe problem requires the calculation of the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter `a`:** 10 Angstrom (The \"interatomic distance\" is interpreted as the lattice constant `a`, where the primitive lattice vectors have equal length).\n*   **Interaxial Angles `α`, `β`, `γ`:** All are equal to 30°.\n*   **Miller Indices `(hkl)`:** (111)\n\n### Step 2: Select the Correct Formula\nThe first and most critical step is to use the correct formula for the interplanar spacing, `d_hkl`, in a rhombohedral crystal system.

This minimizes the number of calculations and the potential for rounding errors.\n\n1.  **Substitute Miller Indices:** For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n    *   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\n2.  **Simplify the Formula:** Substituting these values into the general formula and performing algebraic and trigonometric simplification leads to a much simpler and more robust expression for the (111) plane:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n3.  **Substitute Numerical Values:** Now, we substitute the given values (`a = 10` Å and `α = 30°`) into this simplified formula. For maximum precision, the exact value of `cos(30°) = √3 / 2` is used.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n4.  **Solve for d_111:** Invert the equation and take the square root.\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the result is **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\n### Careful Points\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, several points require careful attention to ensure the correct answer is reached:\n\n1.  **Formula Selection:** It is essential to use the specific, and rather complex, formula for the rhombohedral crystal system. Using a formula for a simpler system (like cubic) would lead to a completely incorrect answer.\n2.  **Algebraic Simplification:** For high-symmetry planes like (111), the general formula can be simplified. As shown in Step 3, doing so is the most robust method as it significantly reduces the number of terms and minimizes the potential for calculation and rounding errors.\n3.  **Calculation Precision:** When performing the calculation, it is best practice to use exact values for trigonometric functions (e.g., `√3/2` for `cos(30°)`) as long as possible. Prematurely rounding these values to decimals can introduce small errors.\n4.  **Option Matching:** This was the most common point of failure among the candidate answers. There was a strong consensus on the numerical result (~9.54 Å), but the agents selected different lettered options. This indicates that the options were presented to them in a shuffled order. It is critical to match the final calculated value to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation consistently and accurately yields an interplanar distance of approximately **9.54 Angstrom**.
