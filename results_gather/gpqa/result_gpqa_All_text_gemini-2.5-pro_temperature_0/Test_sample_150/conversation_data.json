    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given information**\n*   The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (state vector) `|ψ⟩`:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = \n    |-1|\n    | 2|\n    | 1|\n    ```\n*   The observable is represented by the matrix operator `P`:\n    ```\n    P = \n    | 0    1/√2   0    |\n    | 1/√2   0    1/√2 |\n    | 0    1/√2   0    |\n    ```\n*   We need to find the probability of measuring the value `λ = 0`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the theoretical framework**\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue `λ` of an observable `P` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ_norm⟩|^2`\nwhere:\n*   `|ψ_norm⟩` is the normalized state vector of the system.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the normalized eigenvector of the operator `P` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|` is the Hermitian conjugate (bra) of the eigenvector `|v_λ⟩`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ_norm⟩` is the inner product (or projection) of the state vector onto the eigenvector.\n\n**Step 3: Normalize the state vector `|ψ⟩`**\nA state vector must be normalized to have a length of 1 for probability calculations.\n1.  Calculate the squared norm of `|ψ⟩`, which is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)*(-1) + (2)*(2) + (1)*(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n2.  The norm is `||ψ|| = √6`.\n3.  The normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` is `|ψ⟩ / ||ψ||`:\n    ```\n    |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * \n    |-1|\n    | 2|\n    | 1|\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Find the eigenvalues and the eigenvector for the eigenvalue `λ = 0`**\nFirst, we must confirm that 0 is a possible outcome, which means it must be an eigenvalue of `P`. We find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n```\ndet | -λ    1/√2   0    |\n    | 1/√2   -λ    1/√2 | = 0\n    | 0    1/√2   -λ    |\n```\n` -λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) = 0`\n` -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0`\n` -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n` -λ³ + λ = 0`\n` λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`. Since 0 is an eigenvalue, it is a possible measurement outcome.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvector `|v_0⟩` corresponding to `λ = 0` by solving `(P - 0*I)|v_0⟩ = 0`, or `P|v_0⟩ = 0`. Let `|v_0⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n```\n| 0    1/√2   0    | |x|   |0|\n| 1/√2   0    1/√2 | |y| = |0|\n| 0    1/√2   0    | |z|   |0|\n```\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. We can choose `x=1` to get an unnormalized eigenvector `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step 5: Normalize the eigenvector `|v_0⟩`**\n1.  Calculate the squared norm of the unnormalized eigenvector: `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.\n2.  The norm is `√2`.\n3.  The normalized eigenvector `|v_0⟩` is:\n    ```\n    |v_0⟩ = (1/√2) * \n    | 1|\n    | 0|\n    |-1|\n    ```\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the probability**\nNow we use the formula `Prob(0) = |⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩|^2`.\n1.  First, find the inner product `⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩`. The bra `⟨v_0|` is `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n    `⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩ = [ (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ] * [ (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T ]`\n    `= (1/√2) * (1/√6) * [1, 0, -1] · [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*(1))`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-1 + 0 - 1)`\n    `= -2 / √12`\n2.  Now, square the magnitude of this result to find the probability:\n    `Prob(0) = |-2 / √12|^2 = (-2)² / (√12)² = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Normalization is crucial:** Both the initial state vector and the eigenvector used for projection must be normalized to ensure the total probability is 1.\n2.  **Eigenvalue Check:** Always verify that the value you are calculating the probability for is indeed an eigenvalue of the observable's operator.\n3.  **Probability is a Squared Magnitude:** The probability is the absolute square (`|c|^2`) of the projection amplitude `c`, not the amplitude itself. This ensures the probability is a real, non-negative number.\n4.  **Degeneracy:** In this case, the eigenvalue `λ=0` was non-degenerate (had only one corresponding eigenvector direction). If it were degenerate, one would need to project the state vector onto the entire eigenspace and find the squared norm of the resulting vector.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
