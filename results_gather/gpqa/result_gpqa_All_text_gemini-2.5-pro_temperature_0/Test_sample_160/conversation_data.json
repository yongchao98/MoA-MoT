    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area that a target particle presents to the projectile for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze λ1: The Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    *   This scenario describes gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   The projectile is a gas molecule, and the targets are also gas molecules.\n    *   In the kinetic theory of gases, when we consider collisions between identical molecules (approximated as hard spheres of diameter `d`), the collision cross-section must account for the fact that both the projectile and target molecules are in constant thermal motion. This introduces a factor of √2.\n    *   The collision cross-section for molecule-molecule collisions (σ1) is: σ1 = √2 * π * d²\n    *   Therefore, the mean free path λ1 is:\n        **λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1) = 1 / (n * √2 * π * d²)**\n\n3.  **Analyze λ2: The Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n    *   This scenario describes high-energy electrons from the TEM beam colliding with the residual gas molecules.\n    *   The projectile is an electron, and the targets are gas molecules.\n    *   The number density `n` of the gas molecules is the same as in the first case, as the vacuum conditions and temperature have not changed.\n    *   Key differences from the first case:\n        *   **Projectile Size:** An electron is considered a point particle, meaning its own size is negligible compared to the gas molecule.\n        *   **Target Motion:** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them relativistic and moving at speeds very close to the speed of light. The thermal velocity of the gas molecules is minuscule in comparison. Therefore, the gas molecules can be treated as stationary targets. The √2 factor is not needed.\n    *   The collision cross-section (σ2) is the area presented by the stationary gas molecule (a sphere of radius r = d/2) to the point-like electron. This is simply the geometric cross-sectional area of the molecule.\n    *   The collision cross-section for electron-molecule collisions (σ2) is: σ2 = π * r² = π * (d/2)² = (π/4) * d²\n    *   Therefore, the mean free path λ2 is:\n        **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2) = 1 / (n * (π/4) * d²)**\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2**\n    To find the relationship between λ2 and λ1, we can calculate their ratio:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ2)] / [1 / (n * σ1)] = σ1 / σ2\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for the cross-sections:\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * π * d²) / ((π/4) * d²)\n\n    The terms `π` and `d²` cancel out:\n    λ2 / λ1 = √2 / (1/4) = 4 * √2\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result and Conclude**\n    Using the approximation √2 ≈ 1.414:\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n    So, **λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1**\n\n    This result shows that the mean free path of an electron in the gas (λ2) is significantly larger than the mean free path of a gas molecule in the same gas (λ1).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Collision Partners:** The fundamental difference is the nature of the colliding particles: molecule-molecule (λ1) vs. electron-molecule (λ2).\n*   **Relative Motion:** The `√2` factor in the formula for λ1 is crucial and arises from the relative motion between gas molecules. Its absence in the formula for λ2 is equally important, as the gas molecules are effectively stationary compared to the high-speed electrons.\n*   **Effective Size:** For a molecule-molecule collision, the effective diameter is the sum of the radii (2r = d), leading to a cross-section proportional to `d²`. For an electron-molecule collision, the electron is a point particle, so the effective diameter is just the radius of the molecule (r = d/2), leading to a cross-section proportional to `(d/2)²`. This difference introduces a factor of 4 in the comparison.\n\n### Final Conclusion based on Analysis\n\nOur calculation shows that λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1. We must now check which of the given options this result satisfies.\n*   A) λ2 < λ1  (Incorrect, 5.66 > 1)\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct, since 5.66 is greater than or equal to 1.22)\n*   C) λ2 = λ1 (Incorrect)\n*   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, since 5.66 is not less than 1.22)\n\nThe physical analysis robustly shows that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Option B is the only one that correctly describes this relationship.\n\n<<<B>>>"
