    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. The positions ortho to the bromine are C2 (bearing a D) and C6 (bearing an H).\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (C-H bonds are weaker and break more easily than C-D bonds).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at position C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  Although slower, the amide ion can also remove the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is simply **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**Step 3: The Addition Step - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields **2-deuteroaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2).\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields **3-deuteroaniline**. (The NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the NH2 group position 1, the D is at position 3).\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Path B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by NH2⁻ at C1 or C2 leads to the same result after protonation.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 (or C2):** The NH2⁻ attacks one carbon of the triple bond, and the other carbon becomes a carbanion, which is then protonated by NH3. The resulting product has no deuterium and is simply **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: List All Possible Products**\nBased on the analysis of the two reaction pathways, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nThese three molecules are isotopomers and are chemically distinct. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) means that Path A (H-abstraction) is faster than Path B (D-abstraction). This affects the relative amounts of the products, but the question asks for the *number* of possible products, so we must consider all possible, even minor, pathways.\n*   The nucleophilic addition to the unsymmetrical 3-deuterobenzyne occurs at both possible sites (C1 and C6), leading to two different products.\n*   The final protonation step uses a proton (H) from the solvent (NH3), not a deuteron.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction produces three different organic molecules: aniline, 2-deuteroaniline, and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n<<<B>>>"
