    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment, as the CH₂ protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield chemical shifts (below 7 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2H is characteristic of an amino group (-NH₂). An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shifts of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-CH₂-CHO, -NH₂, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring), we can assemble the structure. The two substituents on the benzene ring are the amino group and the acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO).\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    This is the standard reagent for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    The product after this step is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt, usually with gentle warming, causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is a hydrolysis reaction where N₂ gas is evolved.\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms an aldol addition product.\n        *   Enolate: `[HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻`\n        *   Electrophile: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO`\n        *   Addition Product (after protonation): `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal` (This corresponds to option B).\n\n    *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The presence of **heat** strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product to form a more stable, conjugated system. The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) is removed, and the -OH group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated.\n        *   Adduct: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C4)-CH(OH)(C3)-CH(C₂)(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO(C1)`\n        *   Elimination of H₂O gives a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        *   Final Product: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C4)-CH(C3)=C(C₂)(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO(C1)`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\nThe final product of the aldol condensation (under heat) is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Let's name this structure:\n*   The parent chain is a butenal (4-carbon chain with an aldehyde and a double bond).\n*   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a but-2-enal.\n*   There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C2.\n*   There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C4.\n*   The systematic name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. The hydroxyl groups are missing.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate. It is not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final aldol condensation product, formed after dehydration. This matches our derived structure.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure and stoichiometry.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
