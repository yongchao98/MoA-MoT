    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the symmetry of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃) on a benzene ring.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group is an ortho-, para-directing and activating group. It directs the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to itself.\n*   **Product 1:** Due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions, the major product is the para-substituted isomer.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction. Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) has a methyl group at a benzylic position.\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) is an oxidizing agent, often used for oxidizing benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. Its reactivity towards benzylic methyl groups can vary. It can oxidize them to aldehydes or further to carboxylic acids.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must consider the subsequent reaction to deduce the structure of Product 2. The next step involves acetone and base. If Product 2 were the carboxylic acid (p-nitrobenzoic acid), its reaction with acetone enolate would likely form a Meisenheimer complex, which has C₁ symmetry (chiral), which is not among the options. However, if Product 2 is an aldehyde, it can undergo a well-known Claisen-Schmidt condensation with acetone. This suggests the oxidation stops at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde). The methyl group is oxidized to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a crossed aldol condensation, specifically a **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**, between an aldehyde (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone (acetone) in the presence of a base (NaOH).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) to form a nucleophilic enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃).\n    2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) because the resulting C=C double bond is in conjugation with both the aromatic ring and the ketone's carbonyl group, leading to a very stable product.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The more stable trans (E) isomer is formed. The structure is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    *   Structure: p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   To maximize conjugation, the molecule is largely planar. The p-nitrophenyl group, the C=C double bond, and the C=O group all lie in approximately the same plane.\n*   Let's check for symmetry elements:\n    *   **Rotational Axes (Cn):** There are no C₂ or higher-order rotational axes. For example, a C₂ axis passing through the C1-C4 axis of the benzene ring would not work because the substituent (-CH=CH-CO-CH₃) is not symmetric.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule has a plane of symmetry, which is the plane containing the p-nitrophenyl ring and the C=CH-C=O backbone. The methyl group (-CH₃) has fast rotation, so on a time-averaged basis, it does not break this plane of symmetry.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe reaction sequence produces (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, which has Cs symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
