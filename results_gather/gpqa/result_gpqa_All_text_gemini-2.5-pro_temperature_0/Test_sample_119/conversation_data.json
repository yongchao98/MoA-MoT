    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Assumption**\n\nThe problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere in space. The number density `ρ` is the number of stars per unit volume (e.g., stars per cubic parsec).\n*   `ρ = Number of Stars / Volume = constant`\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Number of Stars to Distance**\n\nWe want to find the number of stars at a certain distance from us. It's easiest to consider the number of stars `dN` within a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n*   The volume of this thin shell `dV` is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n*   The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the constant star density `ρ`:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n**Step 3: Introduce Parallax (plx)**\n\nThe question asks for the distribution in terms of parallax, not distance. We need to convert our variables from distance (`d`, `dd`) to parallax (`plx`, `d(plx)`).\n*   The relationship between parallax `plx` and distance `d` is: `plx = 1/d`.\n*   This also means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the Differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`**\n\nWe need to find how a small interval of distance `dd` relates to a small interval of parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this using calculus by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n*   `dd / d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n*   Therefore, `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n*   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. For counting the number of stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can write: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute Parallax into the Star Count Equation**\n\nNow we take our equation for the number of stars in a shell (`dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`) and substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx`.\n*   Substitute `d = 1/plx`.\n*   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` (using the magnitude).\n*   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n*   Combine the terms: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n**Step 6: Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax**\n\nThe question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx\". This quantity is `dN/d(plx)`. From our equation in Step 5, we can find this by dividing both sides by `d(plx)`.\n*   `dN / d(plx) = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n*   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Uniform Distribution:** The entire result hinges on the assumption that `ρ` is constant. In reality, the density of stars changes (e.g., it's higher in the galactic plane and disk), but for this idealized problem, we assume it's uniform.\n2.  **Parallax-Distance Relation:** The relation `plx = 1/d` is fundamental. Remember that a small parallax corresponds to a large distance, and vice-versa.\n3.  **Differential Shell:** The key to solving this is to consider the number of stars not in a whole sphere, but in a thin shell at distance `d`. This gives us the number of stars *at* a certain distance, which is what we need.\n4.  **Change of Variables:** The conversion from the distance differential `dd` to the parallax differential `d(plx)` is a crucial calculus step. The `1/plx²` factor that arises from this differentiation is critical to the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nTo summarize the derivation:\n1.  Number of stars in a shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`: `dN ∝ d² * dd`\n2.  Convert to parallax: `d = 1/plx` and `dd ∝ (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n3.  Substitute: `dN ∝ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx) = (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n4.  The number of stars per unit parallax range is `dN/d(plx)`.\n5.  Therefore, `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
