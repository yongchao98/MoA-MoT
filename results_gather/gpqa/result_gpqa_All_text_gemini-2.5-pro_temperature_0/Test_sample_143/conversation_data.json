    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean distance a particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. This is known as the mean decay distance or mean decay length, denoted by $L$.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Mean Lifetime:** The mean decay distance is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$): $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle as measured in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$) due to relativistic time dilation. The relationship is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The decay width ($\\Gamma$) of an unstable particle is related to its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the uncertainty principle: $\\Gamma \\cdot \\tau_0 \\approx \\hbar$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. Therefore, $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   Combine the principles above to get a single formula for the mean decay distance $L$.\n        *   Start with $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n        *   Substitute $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$: $L = \\gamma v \\tau_0$.\n        *   Introduce $\\beta = v/c$, so $v = \\beta c$: $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$.\n        *   Substitute $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$: $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n        *   This can be conveniently rewritten as $L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   Calculate the necessary quantities ($\\gamma$ and $\\beta$) from the given information.\n    *   Substitute all values into the final formula to find $L$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Units:** It is crucial to maintain consistent units. In particle physics, it's common to use Mega-electron-volts (MeV) or Giga-electron-volts (GeV) for energy, mass, and width. The product $\\hbar c$ is a useful constant that helps convert between energy units and length units.\n*   **Proper vs. Lab Frame:** The decay width $\\Gamma_X$ is an intrinsic property of the particle and is related to its *proper* lifetime $\\tau_0$. The decay distance, however, is measured in the *lab frame*, so the time-dilated lifetime $\\tau_{lab}$ must be used. The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ correctly bridges these two frames.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The particle's energy ($E_X = 8$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass ($m_X = 1.2$ GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. Therefore, using relativistic formulas for energy and time is essential.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**:\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{8 \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the velocity factor ($\\beta = v/c$)**:\n    The velocity factor is related to the Lorentz factor by $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$. We can solve for $\\beta$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{20}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{9}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{400}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{20}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the product $\\gamma \\beta$**:\n    This term represents the particle's momentum in units of its rest mass ($p/m_X c$).\n    $\\gamma \\beta = \\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{20}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance ($L$)**:\n    Now, use the formula $L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   Given: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Constant: $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 femtometer, fm, is $10^{-15}$ m).\n    *   Substitute the values:\n        $L = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}\\right) \\times \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n    *   Calculate the numerical values:\n        $\\sqrt{391} \\approx 19.7737$\n        $L \\approx \\left(\\frac{19.7737}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{197.327}{320}\\right) \\text{ fm}$\n        $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (0.6166) \\text{ fm}$\n        $L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n5.  **Convert to Meters**:\n    Since $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$:\n    $L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
