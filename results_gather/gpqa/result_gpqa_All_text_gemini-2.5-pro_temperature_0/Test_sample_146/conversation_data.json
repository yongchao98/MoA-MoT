    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process and Conservation Laws:**\n    The problem describes a particle annihilation process: a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilate to produce four new particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). In any such interaction, both total energy and total momentum must be conserved. Since the final particles are expected to be moving at high speeds, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   The initial particles are a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key phrase indicating that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore approximate it as being at rest.\n    *   In a typical fixed-target experiment, the proton would be part of a stationary target. Thus, we can assume the proton is also at rest.\n    *   With both initial particles effectively at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero ($\\vec{P}_{initial} \\approx 0$). This means the annihilation occurs in the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   A particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, so $m_{\\bar{p}} = m_p$.\n    *   Therefore, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} \\approx 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: $2A^+ + 2A^-$.\n    *   We are given that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. We assume the antiparticle $A^-$ has the same mass as the particle $A^+$.\n    *   By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($\\vec{P}_{final} = 0$).\n    *   For the total momentum to be zero, the four final particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta cancel out.\n    *   Since the system is in the center-of-mass frame and the four final particles have identical masses, the available energy will be distributed equally among them. This means each of the four A particles will have the same speed, $v_A$, and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles: $E_{final} = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    We equate the total initial energy and the total final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Velocity of Particle A ($v_A$):**\n    *   First, we solve the energy equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Now, substitute the known values for the rest energies:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{938 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938}{600} \\approx 1.5633$\n    *   Next, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2} \\implies 1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2} \\implies \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091}$\n        $\\beta \\approx \\sqrt{0.5909} \\approx 0.7687$\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c, which corresponds to option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" approximation:** It is critical to interpret this as meaning the initial kinetic energy is negligible, simplifying the initial state to a system at rest.\n*   **Relativistic kinematics:** The energies involved ($m_p c^2 \\gg m_A c^2$) and the resulting speeds require the use of relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$), not classical ones ($E=mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$).\n*   **Symmetry:** The symmetry of the initial state (at rest) and the final state (four identical-mass particles) allows for the simple assumption that energy is distributed equally.\n*   **Constants:** Using the standard value for the proton's rest energy ($m_p c^2 \\approx 938$ MeV) is necessary.\n\n<<<D>>>"
