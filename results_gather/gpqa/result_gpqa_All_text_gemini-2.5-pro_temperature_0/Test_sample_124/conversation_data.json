    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Potential:**\n    The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., it depends only on the distance $r$ from the origin.\n\n2.  **Set up the Hamiltonian:**\n    In Cartesian coordinates, the radial distance squared is $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. The potential can be written as:\n    $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$.\n    The total Hamiltonian $H$ is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(x, y, z)$\n    $H = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2\\right)$\n    This shows that the 3D Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent 1D harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians: $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    Since the Hamiltonian is separable, the total energy eigenvalue $E$ is the sum of the energy eigenvalues from each of the three 1D harmonic oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n    Therefore, the total energy for the 3D system is:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    We can define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n4.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of $N$.\n    *   **Ground State (0th excited state):** $N=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $N=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    We can list all possible combinations:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) --- (3 states)\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n        *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) --- (6 states)\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        *   (1, 1, 1) --- (1 state)\n    The total number of combinations is the sum of these counts: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Therefore, the degeneracy of the third excited state is 10. This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing 1D and 3D Oscillators:** The ground state energy for a 1D oscillator is $(\\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, while for a 3D isotropic oscillator it is $(\\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Identifying Excited States:** The ground state corresponds to $N=0$. The \"third excited state\" corresponds to $N=3$, not $n=3$.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator for a given $N$ can be calculated quickly with the formula $g(N) = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$. For $N=3$, this gives $g(3) = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$. This confirms the manual counting.\n*   **Eliminating Incorrect Options:** Options C and D present an energy formula proportional to $1/r^2$, which is characteristic of the energy for a particle in an infinite spherical well, not a harmonic oscillator. They can be dismissed immediately.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (its degeneracy) is 10.\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
