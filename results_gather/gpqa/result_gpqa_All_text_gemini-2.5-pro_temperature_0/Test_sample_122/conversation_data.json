    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the frames of reference and given information.**\n*   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame.\n*   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame.\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame is given as 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in the moving frame (S'). So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the goal.**\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy reference frame (S)**. Let's call this distance `d`. To find this distance, we need to use the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the principle of Time Dilation.**\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes a proper time (`Δt₀`) in a moving frame (the ejecta). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The relationship is given by the formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 6/30 = 1/5 = 0.2`\n\nNow, square this value:\n`(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\nSubstitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\nUsing the time dilation formula from Step 3:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n`Δt = 50 / sqrt(0.96) s`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n`Δt ≈ 50 / 0.9798 ≈ 51.03 s`\nSo, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d).**\nNow we use the distance formula with the time `Δt` calculated for the Galaxy's frame:\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n`d ≈ 3,061,849 km`\n\n**Step 7: Compare the result with the given options.**\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nOur calculated value of `3,061,849 km` is extremely close to option D.\n\n---\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Identifying Proper Time:** The most crucial step is correctly identifying which time interval is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`). Proper time is always the time measured in the reference frame where the event's start and end points occur at the same location (i.e., the clock is at rest relative to the event). Here, the 50 seconds is measured by a clock on the ejecta, so it is the proper time.\n2.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** One could be tempted to use length contraction. If you calculate the distance in the ejecta's frame (`d' = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km`), this is a *contracted length*. The distance in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is the *proper length*. The relationship is `d' = d / γ`, which leads to `d = d' * γ = 3,000,000 * γ`, giving the same result. It's essential not to mix up the formulas.\n3.  **Non-Relativistic Error:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and simply calculate `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option C and is incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%).\n4.  **Incorrect Application of γ:** Another potential error is to multiply by `sqrt(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing. This would give `d = 3,000,000 * sqrt(0.96) ≈ 2,939,388 km`, which is close to option A. This would imply time \"contraction\" instead of dilation, which is incorrect. The time measured in the stationary frame is always longer.\n5.  **Units:** Ensure all units are consistent. Here, using `km/s` for velocity and `s` for time is fine, as the final answer is requested in `km`.\n\nBy correctly applying the principle of time dilation, we find that the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame is longer than 50 seconds, and therefore the distance traveled is greater than the non-relativistic calculation of 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>"
