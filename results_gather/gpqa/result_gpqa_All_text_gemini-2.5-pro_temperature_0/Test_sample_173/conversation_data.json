    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, let's call their rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say $m_1$ is the more massive fragment, so $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy ($Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$):\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times Mc^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times Mc^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n$Q = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final rest energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1 + m_2)c^2$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (0.99M)c^2 = 0.01Mc^2$\n\nUsing the given value $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n$Q = 0.01 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments:\n$T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let $p_{cl}$ be the magnitude of the classical momentum for each fragment.\n    $p_1 = p_2 = p_{cl}$\n*   **Kinetic Energy:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n    *   $T_{1,cl} = p_{cl}^2 / (2m_1)$\n    *   $T_{2,cl} = p_{cl}^2 / (2m_2)$\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    $\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p_{cl}^2 / (2m_1)}{p_{cl}^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    So, $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n*   **Solving for T1:** We know the total kinetic energy is $Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The relativistic momenta are also equal and opposite: $p_1 = p_2 = p_{rel}$.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, where $E$ is the total energy ($E = T + mc^2$).\n    *   $E_1^2 = (p_{rel}c)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2$\n    *   $E_2^2 = (p_{rel}c)^2 + (m_2c^2)^2$\n*   **Solving for Energies:** From the relations above, we can equate the $(p_{rel}c)^2$ terms:\n    $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    $E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (m_1^2 - m_2^2)c^4$\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial total energy was $Mc^2$. The final total energy is $E_1 + E_2$.\n    $E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   **Finding E1:** Substitute the known values into the momentum equation:\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = (198 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (99 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n    $(E_1 - E_2)(300) = 39204 - 9801 = 29403$\n    $E_1 - E_2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n    1.  $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n    2.  $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n    Add the two equations to solve for $E_1$:\n    $2E_1 = 300 + 98.01 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   **Finding T1:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    $T_{1,rel} = E_1 - m_1c^2$\n    $T_{1,rel} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical value.\nDifference = $T_{1,rel} - T_{1,cl}$\nDifference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1.000 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\nDifference = $0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
