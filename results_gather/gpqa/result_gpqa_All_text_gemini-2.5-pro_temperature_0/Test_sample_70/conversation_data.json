    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as T₄ / T₂.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n    T_eq = [ L(1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * r²) ]^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   `L` is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `r` is the orbital radius of the planet.\n    *   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `π` is the mathematical constant pi.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures:** We need to find the ratio T₄ / T₂.\n    *   T₄ = [ L(1 - A₄) / (16 * π * σ * r₄²) ]^(1/4)\n    *   T₂ = [ L(1 - A₂) / (16 * π * σ * r₂²) ]^(1/4)\n\n    When we divide T₄ by T₂, most of the terms will cancel out.\n    T₄ / T₂ = { [ L(1 - A₄) / (16 * π * σ * r₄²) ] / [ L(1 - A₂) / (16 * π * σ * r₂²) ] }^(1/4)\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio using Given Information:**\n    *   The planets orbit the same star, so the luminosity `L` is the same for both and cancels out.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so `A₄ = A₂`. The term `(1 - A)` cancels out.\n    *   The constants `16`, `π`, and `σ` also cancel out.\n\n    After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    T₄ / T₂ = { [ 1 / r₄² ] / [ 1 / r₂² ] }^(1/4)\n    T₄ / T₂ = ( r₂² / r₄² )^(1/4)\n    T₄ / T₂ = ( r₂ / r₄ )^(2/4)\n    T₄ / T₂ = ( r₂ / r₄ )^(1/2)\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Radius (r) to Orbital Period (P):** We don't have the orbital radii, but we have the ratio of orbital periods. We can use Kepler's Third Law to connect these two quantities. For planets orbiting the same star, Kepler's Third Law states:\n    P² ∝ r³ (The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius).\n    This can be written as P² / r³ = constant.\n    Therefore, for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    P₂² / r₂³ = P₄² / r₄³\n\n6.  **Solve for the Radius Ratio (r₂ / r₄):** Rearrange the equation from Kepler's Law:\n    r₂³ / r₄³ = P₂² / P₄²\n    (r₂ / r₄)³ = (P₂ / P₄)²\n    Take the cube root of both sides:\n    r₂ / r₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Substitute the Radius Ratio into the Temperature Ratio Equation:** Now substitute the expression for `r₂ / r₄` back into our simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 4:\n    T₄ / T₂ = [ (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    Using the rule of exponents (x^a)^b = x^(a*b):\n    T₄ / T₂ = (P₂ / P₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T₄ / T₂ = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P₁ : P₂ : P₃ : P₄ : P₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    From this, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5\n    Now, substitute this into our final equation:\n    T₄ / T₂ = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    T₄ / T₂ = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n    T₄ / T₂ ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    Calculating the cube root:\n    T₄ / T₂ ≈ 0.8298...\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.83. This matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius (T ∝ 1/√r).\n*   Kepler's Third Law (P² ∝ r³) is crucial for relating the given period data to the orbital radius.\n*   The fact that the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo is key to simplifying the temperature ratio formula.\n*   The TTV method and orbital resonance information are context to explain why the period ratios are simple and related, but they are not directly used in the calculation itself.\n*   The final calculation involves taking a cube root, which can be estimated by cubing the answer choices to see which one matches the base (4/7 ≈ 0.5714). For example, 0.83³ ≈ 0.5718, which is very close.\n\n<<<D>>>"
