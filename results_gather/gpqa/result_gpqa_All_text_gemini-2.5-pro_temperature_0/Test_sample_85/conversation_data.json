    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\nThe product for both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand the structure.\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom in the ring is assigned position 1.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   This structure is a δ-lactone (delta-lactone), which is a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring.\n*   The molecule has a single stereocenter at carbon 4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThe structure of the lactone is as follows (with IUPAC numbering):\n```\n      O(1)\n     /   \\\nC(6)H2 -- C(2)=O\n|         |\nC(5)H2 -- C(3)H2\n   \\     /\n    C(4)H(Et)\n```\nThis lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The specific hydroxy acid required is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The ethyl group is on C3 of the acid, which becomes C4 of the lactone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that at C5, there is an ester group with an isobutyl alcohol component (-COO-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n*   The structure has a single stereocenter at C3, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n    O                                O\n   //                               //\nHO--C(1)--CH2(2)--CH(3)--CH2(4)--C(5)--O--CH2--CH(CH3)2\n                  |\n                  CH2CH3\n```\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is selective for esters over carboxylic acids. It will reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Reduction of the ester at C5: `...-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl` is reduced to `...-CH₂(4)-C(5)H₂-OH`.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)-OH`\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) protonates intermediates and catalyzes the subsequent intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the stable six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 of the product). Thus, the spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is unchanged.\n    *   However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are: H, Ethyl, `-CH₂-COOH` (let's call this G_acid), and `-CH₂-COOiBu` (let's call this G_ester). Comparing G_acid and G_ester, the ester group has higher priority. So, the priority order is: G_ester > G_acid > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Product:** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are: H, Ethyl, `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from G_acid), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from G_ester). Comparing these, the group derived from the acid has higher priority. So, the priority order is: (from G_acid) > (from G_ester) > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the two main chain substituents have swapped. This means that if the starting material has an (S) configuration, the product will have an (R) configuration (and vice-versa).\n    *   Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A must be (S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that is selective for carboxylic acids over esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Reduction of the carboxylic acid at C1: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-...` is reduced to `HO-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-...`.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        `HO-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl`\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (from the reduced C1) attacks the ester carbonyl at C5, displacing isobutanol to form the same six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Again, the reactions do not occur at the chiral center. We must check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as before. Priority order: G_ester > G_acid > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Product:** Same lactone as in Reaction 1. The group derived from the original ester (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`) has higher priority than the group derived from the original acid (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`). So, the priority order is: (from G_ester) > (from G_acid) > Ethyl > H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center is maintained throughout the reaction sequence. This means that the configuration is retained. An (S) starting material will give an (S) product.\n    *   Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B must be (S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same compound. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
