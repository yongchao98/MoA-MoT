    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe main objective is to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 (P3) is larger than that of Planet1 (P1). In other words, we need to calculate the ratio P3 / P1.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles**\nTo solve this problem, we need two key concepts from astrophysics:\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature of a Planet:** This relates a planet's temperature to its distance from its star.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This relates a planet's orbital period to its orbital distance (semi-major axis).\n\n**3. Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Radius**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula is derived by setting the absorbed power equal to the radiated power.\n\n*   Power Absorbed: `P_abs = (L_star / (4πa²)) * πR_p² * (1 - A)`\n*   Power Radiated: `P_rad = 4πR_p² * σ * T_eq⁴`\n\nWhere:\n*   `L_star` is the star's luminosity.\n*   `a` is the planet's orbital radius (since the orbits are circular).\n*   `R_p` is the planet's radius.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nSetting `P_abs = P_rad` and simplifying, we find that `T_eq⁴` is proportional to `1/a²`.\n`T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a²`\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives the relationship between temperature and orbital radius:\n`T_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) = a^(-1/2)`\n\nThis means that for any two planets (i and j) orbiting the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is:\n`(T_eq_i / T_eq_j) = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)`\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of their orbital radii:\n`(a_j / a_i) = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)²`\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Radii (a3 / a1)**\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n*   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n*   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n\nUsing the formula from Step 3, we can find the ratios of the individual orbital radii:\n*   `a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = (1.4)² = 1.96`\n*   `a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = (2.3)² = 5.29`\n\nTo find the total ratio `a3 / a1`, we multiply these two ratios:\n`a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`\n\nAlternatively, we can combine the expressions first:\n`a3 / a1 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = ( (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) )²`\nWe can find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` first:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\nNow, we can find `a3 / a1`:\n`a3 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)² = (3.22)² = 10.3684`\n\n**5. Relate Orbital Radius to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law**\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\n`P² ∝ a³`\n\nFor two planets (i and j) in the same system:\n`(P_i / P_j)² = (a_i / a_j)³`\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n`P_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2)`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Ratio of Orbital Periods (P3 / P1)**\nUsing the relationship from Step 5 and the value of `a3 / a1` from Step 4:\n`P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)`\n`P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)`\n\nWe can also express this using our combined value from Step 4:\n`a3 / a1 = (3.22)²`\n`P3 / P1 = [ (3.22)² ]^(3/2) = (3.22)^(2 * 3/2) = (3.22)³`\n\nNow, we calculate the final value:\n`P3 / P1 = (3.22)³ = 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22 ≈ 33.386`\n\nThis value is approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the ratios of the planet masses and the specific value of the albedo (0.3). This information is not needed for the calculation.\n    *   The planet masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, so they don't significantly affect the period-radius relationship in Kepler's Third Law.\n    *   The albedo value cancels out when taking the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures because it is the same for all three planets.\n*   **Key Relationship:** The most critical step is correctly identifying the proportionality between equilibrium temperature and orbital radius, which is `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`. A common mistake is to use `a^(-1/4)`, which leads to an incorrect result.\n*   **Circular Orbits:** The mention of circular orbits simplifies the problem, allowing us to use the orbital radius `a` directly instead of the semi-major axis.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n1.  Find the ratio of the temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 3:\n    `T1 / T3 = (T1 / T2) * (T2 / T3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n2.  Find the ratio of the orbital radii of Planet 3 and Planet 1:\n    `a3 / a1 = (T1 / T3)² = (3.22)²`\n3.  Find the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 and Planet 1 using Kepler's Third Law:\n    `P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = [ (3.22)² ]^(3/2) = (3.22)³`\n4.  Calculate the final value:\n    `P3 / P1 = 33.386... ≈ 33.4`\n\nThe orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
