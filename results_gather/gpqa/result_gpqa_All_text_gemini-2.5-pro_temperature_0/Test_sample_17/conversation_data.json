    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. In astrophysics, this typically refers to the ratio of the abundance fractions relative to hydrogen, which is the most common element. So, we need to calculate the ratio: `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Notation:** The notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to element Y in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. It is defined as:\n    `[X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )`\n    A very useful identity derived from this definition is:\n    `[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]`\n\n3.  **Analyze Star_1:**\n    *   We are given `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`.\n    *   We want to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, which is `[Si/H]_1`.\n    *   Using the identity `[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]`, we can write `[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1`.\n    *   Substituting the given values: `0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0`.\n    *   This gives us `[Si/H]_1 = 0.3`.\n    *   Now, we use the definition of `[Si/H]_1`:\n        `[Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) = 0.3`\n    *   Rearranging this equation to solve for the abundance fraction in Star_1:\n        `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n    *   Taking the antilog (10 to the power of each side):\n        `(n_Si / n_H)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n4.  **Analyze Star_2:**\n    *   We are given `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`.\n    *   We want to find `[Si/H]_2`.\n    *   Using the identity again: `[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`.\n    *   Substituting the given values: `0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`.\n    *   This gives us `[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`.\n    *   Now, we use the definition of `[Si/H]_2`:\n        `[Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) = -0.3`\n    *   Rearranging for the abundance fraction in Star_2:\n        `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = -0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n    *   Taking the antilog:\n        `(n_Si / n_H)_2 = 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Now we can compute the ratio we set out to find:\n        `Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n    *   Substitute the expressions we found in steps 3 and 4:\n        `Ratio = ( 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) / ( 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n    *   The solar abundance term `(n_Si / n_H)_sun` cancels out.\n        `Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\n    *   Using the exponent rule `x^a / x^b = x^(a-b)`:\n        `Ratio = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^(0.3 + 0.3) = 10^0.6`\n    *   Finally, calculate the numerical value:\n        `10^0.6 â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 3.98, which corresponds to option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrase \"ratio of silicon atoms\" is interpreted as the ratio of abundance fractions `(n_Si/n_H)`, which is standard for this type of problem. A ratio of absolute number densities would require more information about the stars' photospheres (e.g., pressure, temperature).\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The masses of the stars (1.5 and 1.2 M_sun), the method used (LTE, EW), and the specific solar abundances for Iron (Fe) and Magnesium (Mg) are not needed for the final calculation. They are provided as context but can be ignored for the mathematical steps.\n*   **Key Identity:** The relationship `[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]` is the most efficient way to solve the problem, as it directly relates the given quantities to the desired `[Si/H]` values for each star.\n\nThe final calculated value is ~3.98.\n\n<<<C>>>"
