    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the number of loops (`L`) in a Feynman diagram by analyzing the mathematical expression associated with it.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Expression:** The given expression is:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\n3.  **Identify Key Components:** In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), different parts of such an expression correspond to different features of the Feynman diagram.\n    *   **Coupling Constants (`alpha`, `g`):** The powers of coupling constants relate to the number of interaction vertices in the diagram. Here, `alpha^3` and `g^2` suggest there are 3 vertices of one type and 2 of another, for a total of 5 vertices.\n    *   **Numerical Factors (`sqrt(2)`, `8`):** These are typically results of symmetry factors, group theory calculations (e.g., traces of matrices), or specific integral results. They do not directly indicate the number of loops.\n    *   **Energy/Mass Ratios (`(Q/M)^2`):** This term often appears from the evaluation of loop integrals, especially in logarithms like `log(Q^2/M^2)`. It reflects the energy scales of the process but doesn't directly count the loops.\n    *   **The Loop Factor (`1/(4pi)^6`):** This is the most crucial piece of information for this problem.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Loop Factor:**\n    *   In QFT calculations, especially when using dimensional regularization in four-dimensional spacetime (D=4), each loop integral over an internal momentum `k` is of the form `∫ d^4k / (2π)^4`.\n    *   After performing a Wick rotation to Euclidean space and integrating over the angular parts of the 4D momentum, each loop integral systematically produces a factor of `1 / (4π)^(D/2)`.\n    *   For our case, the spacetime is four-dimensional, so D=4. Therefore, **each loop contributes a factor of `1 / (4π)^(4/2) = 1 / (4π)^2`**.\n    *   If a diagram has `L` loops, the total factor from all the loop integrations will be `(1 / (4π)^2)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Number of Loops (L):**\n    *   The expression given in the note contains the factor `1/(4pi)^6`.\n    *   We can equate this to the general form for `L` loops:\n        `1 / (4pi)^(2L) = 1 / (4pi)^6`\n    *   For the two sides to be equal, their exponents must be equal:\n        `2L = 6`\n    *   Solving for `L`, we get:\n        `L = 6 / 2 = 3`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Universality of the Loop Factor:** The `1/(4π)^2` factor per loop is a very general feature of perturbative QFT calculations in 4D and is the most reliable indicator for the loop number.\n*   **Distinguishing from Other Factors:** It is important not to be misled by the other numbers or variables. The powers of the coupling constants tell you about vertices, not loops. The numerical factors and mass ratios are results of the specific calculation, but the power of `4π` is a direct consequence of the number of momentum-space integrations, which is the definition of the loop number.\n*   **Consistency Check:** A 3-loop diagram with 5 vertices (inferred from `alpha^3 * g^2`) is a topologically valid structure in QFT. Using the formula `L = I - V + 1` (where `I` is internal lines, `V` is vertices), we have `3 = I - 5 + 1`, which gives `I = 7` internal lines. This is a perfectly reasonable diagram structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the loop factor `1/(4pi)^6` robustly indicates that the calculation involved three loop integrations. Therefore, the Feynman diagram had 3 loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
