    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Underlying Physics and Mathematics:**\n    The decay of a single radioactive atom is a random process. The probability of decay is constant over time, which means the process follows an exponential distribution. A crucial characteristic of the exponential distribution is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n2.  **The \"Memoryless\" Property:**\n    This property means that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of its past history. In this context, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is not affected by the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes. The atom doesn't \"age\" or get \"tired\". Its chance of decaying in any given second is always the same. Therefore, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a newly formed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Define the Decay Probability Function:**\n    Let P(t) be the probability that the atom decays within a time interval of length `t`. The survival probability, S(t), is the probability it has *not* decayed by time `t`.\n    *   P(t) = 1 - S(t)\n    The survival probability for exponential decay is given by the formula:\n    *   S(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    So, the decay probability is:\n    *   P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom:**\n    We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   P(100) = 0.32\n    This means the survival probability for 100 minutes is:\n    *   S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n    Using the survival formula:\n    *   e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As established by the memoryless property, this is equivalent to calculating P(150) for a new atom.\n    *   P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n    We can find the value of e^(-150λ) using the information from the previous step. We can express -150λ as (-100λ) * 1.5.\n    *   e^(-150λ) = e^((-100λ) * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n    Now, substitute the value we found for e^(-100λ):\n    *   e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   (0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68\n    *   √0.68 ≈ 0.8246\n    *   (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n    Now, calculate the final decay probability:\n    *   P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to the given option of 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Memoryless Property:** This is the most critical point. Forgetting this would lead to incorrect calculations involving conditional probability that are unnecessarily complex and might lead to errors if not handled carefully. The fact that 50 minutes have passed is extraneous information.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability:** Be careful to distinguish between the probability of decay (P(t)) and the probability of survival (S(t)). The exponential formula e^(-λt) directly gives the survival probability.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The calculation relies on correctly manipulating the exponents (e.g., e^(a*b) = (e^a)^b) to avoid explicitly calculating the decay constant λ, which simplifies the arithmetic and reduces rounding errors.\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
