    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This means we need to calculate the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total_1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_2).\n    *   `Ratio = M_total_1 / M_total_2`\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 1b (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2a (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial velocity amplitude of star 2b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n    *   The problem involves spectroscopic binary stars. The total mass of such a system can be related to its orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1, K2) of its stars.\n    *   The relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law. For a binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is given by:\n        `M_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ((K1 + K2)^3 / sin^3(i))`\n        where:\n        *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n        *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Analyze Careful Points:**\n    *   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue:** The problem states that both systems are *eclipsing*. This is a crucial piece of information. For eclipses to occur, we must be viewing the system nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°.\n    *   **Simplification:** When `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. This significantly simplifies the mass formula, as we can effectively ignore the `sin^3(i)` term.\n    *   **Units:** Since we are calculating a ratio, we do not need to convert the units (years to seconds, km/s to m/s) as long as we are consistent. The units will cancel out.\n\n5.  **Derive the Ratio Formula:**\n    *   Using the simplified formula `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3`, we can set up the ratio for our two systems.\n    *   `M_total_1 ∝ P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3`\n    *   `M_total_2 ∝ P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3`\n    *   The ratio is:\n        `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3]`\n        `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 / P2) * [(K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b)]^3`\n\n6.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   First, calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system:\n        *   System 1: `K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n        *   System 2: `K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n    *   Now, plug all the values into the ratio formula:\n        `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (2 years / 1 year) * [(15 km/s) / (25 km/s)]^3`\n    *   Simplify the fractions:\n        `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * [15 / 25]^3`\n        `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * [3 / 5]^3`\n    *   Calculate the cube:\n        `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (3*3*3 / 5*5*5)`\n        `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    *   Perform the final multiplication:\n        `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 54 / 125`\n    *   Convert the fraction to a decimal:\n        `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated ratio is `0.432`.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options:\n        A) ~ 1.2\n        B) ~ 0.7\n        C) ~ 0.4\n        D) ~ 0.6\n    *   The value `0.432` is closest to `0.4`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is approximately 0.432.\n\n<<<C>>>"
