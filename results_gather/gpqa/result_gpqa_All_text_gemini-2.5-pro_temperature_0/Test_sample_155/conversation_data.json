    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs an epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack), resulting in an overall anti-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond. This process is called anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene. There is a general rule for such reactions on symmetrically substituted alkenes: **Trans + Anti -> Meso**.\n    *   Let's verify this. The starting (E)-oct-4-ene is achiral. The reagents are achiral. The reaction proceeds through a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide. The subsequent anti-opening of this racemic epoxide mixture yields a single meso product.\n    *   The product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which has the configuration (4R, 5S). A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers, due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a single, unique compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene. The general rule is: **Cis + Anti -> Racemic**.\n    *   Let's verify this. The starting (Z)-oct-4-ene is achiral. The epoxidation with mCPBA forms a single meso-epoxide. The subsequent anti-opening of this achiral meso-epoxide by water (an achiral nucleophile) must result in an achiral product mixture. Attack at the two carbons of the epoxide leads to two different products that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   The products are **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a racemic mixture.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture containing two different compounds (enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of the (4R, 5R)-diol.\n*   The meso-diol is also a **diastereomer** of the (4S, 5S)-diol.\n*   The (4R, 5R)-diol and the (4S, 5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   We will observe **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   A chiral column can separate diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, a chiral column can also separate enantiomers, because the two enantiomers will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated.\n    *   We will observe **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
