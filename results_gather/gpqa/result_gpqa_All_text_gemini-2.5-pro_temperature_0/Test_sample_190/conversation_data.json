    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Key functional groups:** Ketone, primary alcohol, alkene.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Sodium Hydride (NaH):** This is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr):** This is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed is a strong nucleophile. It will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Reaction:** The alcohol group is protected as a benzyl ether.\n    -CH2OH → -CH2O⁻ → -CH2-O-CH2-Ph (or -CH2OBn)\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide:** This reagent reacts with aldehydes and ketones.\n    2.  **HCl (catalyst):** The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and accelerating the reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This involves the nucleophilic attack of the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide on the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration (loss of a water molecule).\n    C=O → C=N-NHTs\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1. Its systematic name is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** This is a very strong base. The reaction of a tosylhydrazone with at least two equivalents of a strong base like n-BuLi is known as the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    2.  **Mechanism:** n-BuLi first deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone, then a second equivalent deprotonates the carbon α to the C=N bond. The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates nitrogen gas (N2) and the tosyl group (as lithium p-toluenesulfinate) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    3.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl):** This is a mild proton source used in the workup to quench the reaction and protonate the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Reaction:** The Shapiro reaction is a method for converting a ketone into an alkene. The original C=O group is effectively replaced by a C=C double bond. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon and one of its adjacent α-carbons.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected. The structure is a substituted cyclohexene, for example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. The exact position of the newly formed double bond is not critical for determining the final product.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for several types of reductions.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) will be reduced to single bonds (C-C). This means the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will both be hydrogenated.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** A key reaction catalyzed by Pd/C is the cleavage of benzyl ethers (and benzyl esters, benzylamines, etc.). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the oxygen is broken, and hydrogen atoms are added.\n        *   Benzyl ether [-CH2-O-Bn] → Alcohol [-CH2-OH] + Toluene [Ph-CH3]\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product will have a saturated cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The benzyl ether is cleaved, regenerating the original hydroxymethyl group. The substituents on the ring are an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, maintaining their 1,3-relationship from the starting material.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer Evaluation:**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is a benzyl ether. The benzyl ether is cleaved in Step 4.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure results from the hydrogenation of both alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, which is not its role in the Shapiro reaction. It also incorrectly retains the benzyl ether.\n\nThe final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
