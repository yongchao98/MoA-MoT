    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$. This resolution is a measure of distance (track length).\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s. This is the average lifetime in the particle's own rest frame.\n    *   Total energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame (Bubble Chamber): $E = 27$ GeV.\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV. (We use $c=1$ for convenience in intermediate steps, so $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV).\n    *   Condition: Observe at least 30% of decays.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Calculations:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed, so its lifetime and the distance it travels will be affected by time dilation and length contraction from the lab's perspective.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor relates the total energy and rest mass.\n        $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    *   **Calculate the Lifetime in the Lab Frame ($\\tau_{lab}$):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime observed in the lab is longer than the proper lifetime.\n        $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L_{lab}$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays.\n    $L_{lab} = v \\times \\tau_{lab}$\n    To find the velocity $v$, we can use the relativistic momentum. First, find the momentum $p$:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    Now, we can find the velocity factor $\\beta = v/c$ using the momentum:\n    $pc = \\gamma m_0 (\\beta c) c = \\gamma \\beta (m_0 c^2)$\n    $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.854$\n\n    The mean decay length is:\n    $L_{lab} = (\\beta\\gamma) \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n    $L_{lab} = 7.854 \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $L_{lab} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Interpret the \"Observe 30% of Decays\" Condition:**\n    The phrasing \"minimum resolution\" is slightly ambiguous. Let's analyze the most plausible physical interpretations.\n    *   **Interpretation A:** The resolution is the characteristic distance by which 30% of particles have decayed. This is not a standard definition of resolution.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** A decay is \"observed\" if its track length is greater than the detector's resolution, $R$. The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $R$ is given by the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance} > R) = e^{-R/L_{lab}}$. We want this fraction to be at least 30% ($0.3$).\n        $e^{-R/L_{lab}} \\ge 0.3$\n        This gives an upper limit on the resolution: $R \\le -L_{lab} \\ln(0.3) \\approx 1.204 \\times L_{lab}$.\n    *   **Interpretation C (most likely intended):** The question is asking for a characteristic length scale of the decay process. The most important one is the mean decay length, $L_{lab}$. Let's check if a resolution equal to $L_{lab}$ satisfies the condition. If $R = L_{lab}$, the fraction of observed decays is $e^{-L_{lab}/L_{lab}} = e^{-1} \\approx 0.368$, or 36.8%. Since 36.8% is greater than 30%, the mean decay length is a valid resolution that meets the criteria.\n\n6.  **Compare Calculation with Options:**\n    Our calculated mean decay length is $L_{lab} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    The given options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\n    Our calculated value ($1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The difference is about 10%.\n\n7.  **Reconcile the Discrepancy:**\n    This 10% difference strongly suggests a typo in the problem's given values, which is common in textbook problems. Let's assume the answer D is correct and see what input value would produce it. If we assume the intended answer is $L_{lab} = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, this would require the particle's rest mass to be $m_0 \\approx 3.095$ GeV. This mass is extremely close to the known mass of the J/ψ meson (3.0969 GeV), a particle commonly studied in high-energy physics. It is highly probable that the problem was intended to be about a J/ψ meson, but its mass was incorrectly stated as 3.41 GeV.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the question is asking for the mean decay length of the particle in the lab frame. The calculation using the provided numbers yields a result very close to option D. The small discrepancy is almost certainly due to a typo in the particle's mass in the problem statement. Therefore, the intended answer is the one closest to our calculated value.\n\n*   Calculated Mean Decay Length: $L_{lab} \\approx 1.89 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   Closest Option: D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
