    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given information about the compound.**\n\n*   **Structure:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it's a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **Molecular Formula Information:** It contains 8 carbon atoms in total. A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Deduce the possible structure of the compound.**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   A 2-carbon group containing a carbonyl (C=O) is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).**\n\n*   We need to look at the patterns in the aromatic region of the provided 1H NMR options.\n*   Options A and C both show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (e.g., `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`).\n*   This specific pattern (two doublets of equal integration) is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons, and they split each other into two doublets.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** As established, the para-substitution will result in two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.5 ppm). Each doublet will integrate to 2H. The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm) than those closer to the halogen.\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, the methyl protons will not be split and will appear as a **singlet**. This signal will integrate to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for protons of a methyl ketone (Ar-COCH₃) is around **2.0-2.7 ppm**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. The peak at 3.7 ppm is for 2H, not 3H. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are not in the correct range for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for the four protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H at a chemical shift of 2.3 ppm, which is exactly what is expected for the methyl group of an acetyl substituent.\n    *   This option is a perfect match for our deduced structure of 4-haloacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are not in the correct range for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that matches all the structural features derived from the problem description is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
