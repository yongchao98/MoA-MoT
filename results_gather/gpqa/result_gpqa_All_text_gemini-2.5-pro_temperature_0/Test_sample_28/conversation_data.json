    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find a mutation that will most likely eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to disrupt the function of this protein, ideally by creating a \"knockout\" mutation that results in a non-functional or absent protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe provided sequence is the beginning of the coding region (first exon) of the gene.\nIntact gene: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n\nLet's break this sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides) to determine the original amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with `ATG`, which is the start codon.\n*   `ATG` - Methionine (Met) - Start codon\n*   `TTT` - Phenylalanine (Phe)\n*   `CTC` - Leucine (Leu)\n*   `GCT` - Alanine (Ala)\n*   `GGT` - Glycine (Gly)\n*   `ACT` - Threonine (Thr)\n*   ...and so on.\n\nThe goal is to find a mutation that causes the most significant disruption to the protein that will be translated from this sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Individually**\n\n**Careful Point:** The most effective mutations for knocking out gene function are typically **nonsense mutations** (which create a premature stop codon) or **frameshift mutations** (insertions or deletions of nucleotides not in a multiple of three). These are generally more disruptive than **missense mutations** (which change one amino acid to another) or **silent mutations** (which don't change the amino acid at all).\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...` (Met-Phe-Leu...)\n        *   Mutant 1: `ATG TTC TAC ...` (Met-Phe-Tyr...)\n    *   Analysis: The codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid. While this *could* affect protein function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...` (Met-Phe-Leu...)\n        *   Mutant 2: `ATG TTC TAA ...`\n    *   Analysis: The codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC` (a silent mutation, as in Mutant 1). The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Impact:** This mutation will cause the ribosome to stop translation after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein this severely truncated is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...` (Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...)\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ...` (Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val...)\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `ACT` (Threonine) has changed to `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this changes the amino acid sequence, but it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `ATG TTT TAC GCT --- ACT TCT ...`\n    *   Analysis: There are two changes here. First, the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), which is a **missense mutation**. Second, the codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted entirely. Since a full codon (3 nucleotides) was deleted, this is an **in-frame deletion**. The reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved, but the final protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another one changed (Leu to Tyr). While this is a significant change, it is less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Mutations and Conclude**\n*   Mutant 1: One amino acid change. (Less likely to be a knockout)\n*   **Mutant 2: Introduces a premature STOP codon. Protein synthesis stops almost immediately. (Most likely to be a knockout)**\n*   Mutant 3: Two amino acid changes. (Less likely to be a knockout)\n*   Mutant 4: One amino acid change and one amino acid deletion. (Significant, but less certain to be a knockout than a premature stop codon).\n\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most drastic change, leading to a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
