    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final pH of the mixed solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Nature of the Reactants**\nFirst, we identify the chemical nature of each substance being mixed:\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** A weak acid. It does not dissociate completely in water.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** A strong acid. It dissociates completely in water to give H+ and Cl- ions.\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide):** A strong base. It dissociates completely in water to give Ba2+ and OH- ions. Note that each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH- ions.\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Moles of Each Species**\nWe need to find the number of moles of the acid (H+), weak acid (CH3COOH), and base (OH-) before any reaction occurs.\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid (HCl → H+ + Cl-), moles of H+ = **0.080 mol H+**\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-), it provides two OH- ions per formula unit.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n**3. Perform the Neutralization Reactions**\nThe key principle is that strong acids and strong bases react with each other first, completely. Then, any excess strong acid or base will react with the weak species.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Reaction between Strong Acid (H+) and Strong Base (OH-)**\n    *   We have 0.080 mol of H+ from HCl and 0.180 mol of OH- from Ba(OH)2.\n    *   The neutralization reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   The limiting reactant is H+. All 0.080 mol of H+ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = Initial OH- - Reacted OH- = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH-**\n\n*   **Step 3b: Reaction between Excess Strong Base (OH-) and Weak Acid (CH3COOH)**\n    *   Now, the remaining 0.100 mol of OH- will react with the 0.050 mol of CH3COOH.\n    *   The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   The limiting reactant is CH3COOH. All 0.050 mol of CH3COOH will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = Initial OH- - Reacted OH- = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH-**\n    *   This reaction also produces the conjugate base of acetic acid: 0.050 mol of acetate (CH3COO-) is formed.\n\n**4. Determine the Final Composition and Calculate Concentration**\nAfter all reactions, the final solution contains:\n*   **0.050 mol of excess OH-** (a strong base).\n*   0.050 mol of CH3COO- (a weak base).\n*   Spectator ions (Cl- and Ba2+).\n\nThe pH of the solution will be overwhelmingly determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH-). The contribution from the weak base (CH3COO-) is negligible due to the common ion effect.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**5. Calculate the pOH and pH**\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167)\n    *   pOH ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   In aqueous solutions at 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38\n    *   pH = **12.62**\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
