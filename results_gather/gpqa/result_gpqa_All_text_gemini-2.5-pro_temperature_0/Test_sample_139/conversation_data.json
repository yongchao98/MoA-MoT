    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the clues to identify Substance X.**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"\n    *   This points towards a compound used in isotopic labeling, most commonly involving deuterium (D or ²H), a heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n\n*   **Clue 2:** \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"\n    *   Let's identify Gas W. We need a molecule with an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n).\n        *   H₂: 2p, 0n. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1p and 1n. So D₂ has 2p and 2n. **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   CO₂: C(6p, 6n), O(8p, 8n). Total = 22p, 22n. **This is also a match.**\n        *   N₂O: N(7p, 7n), O(8p, 8n). Total = 22p, 22n. **This is also a match.**\n    *   However, the formation of D₂ gas strongly aligns with the \"heavier isotope\" clue. A violent reaction producing D₂ suggests a powerful deuteride reacting with a deuterium source.\n    *   The most common liquid deuterium source (Liquid Y) is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   So, we hypothesize: **X is a deuteride, Y is D₂O, and W is D₂.**\n\n*   **Clue 3:** \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   277 K is approximately 4 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is \"very close to 277 K\". So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   G is a precipitate that releases D₂O upon heating. This means G is a deuterated hydroxide (a metal hydroxide containing D instead of H).\n    *   Let's test potential candidates for X (strong deuterides):\n        *   If X = NaBD₄ (Sodium borodeuteride): `NaBD₄ + 4 D₂O → NaB(OD)₄ + 4 D₂`. The product, sodium borate, is soluble. No precipitate G would form.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride): `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4 D₂(g)`. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. This fits the description of G.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: `2 Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g)`. This releases B (D₂O).\n    *   This confirms that **X = LiAlD₄**, **Y = D₂O**, **W = D₂**, **G = Al(OD)₃**, and **B = D₂O**.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n    *   X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   `R-CO-COOH + LiAlD₄ → (intermediate) → (after workup) → R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH`\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue is consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Clue 5:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   X is LiAlD₄. Its \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄ (Lithium aluminum hydride), which is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in synthetic organic chemistry. This strongly confirms our identification.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the required value.**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n*   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (number of protons).\n    *   Hydrogen (H/D): Atomic Number = 1  **(Lightest)**\n    *   Lithium (Li): Atomic Number = 3\n    *   Aluminum (Al): Atomic Number = 13 **(Heaviest)**\n*   The question specifies to sum the masses of all instances of these elements. We will use the mass number (protons + neutrons) for the calculation.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of Deuterium (D₄). The mass number of Deuterium (¹p + ¹n) is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** We sum the total masses from the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminum isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer.**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
