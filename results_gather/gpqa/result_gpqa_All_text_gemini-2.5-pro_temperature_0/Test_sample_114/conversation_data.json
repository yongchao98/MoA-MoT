    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the angle between the two photons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the System and Conservation Laws**\nThe problem involves an electron-positron annihilation, which is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors greater than 1), we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Set up the Coordinate System**\nLet's define the horizontal axis as the x-axis.\n*   The electron moves from the left, so its velocity is in the +x direction.\n*   The positron moves from the right, so its velocity is in the -x direction.\n*   The collision occurs at the origin. The photons are emitted in the xy-plane.\n\n**3. Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum**\nWe need to find the total energy and total momentum of the system before the collision. The rest mass of both the electron and the positron is $m_e$.\n\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:**\n    *   Energy: $E = \\gamma m c^2$\n    *   Momentum magnitude: $p = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} m c$\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_e = 4$\n    *   Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$\n    *   Momentum: $p_e = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} m_e c = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$. The direction is +x.\n    *   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_e = (\\sqrt{15} m_e c, 0, 0)$\n\n*   **Positron (e⁺):**\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_p = 2$\n    *   Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$\n    *   Momentum: $p_p = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} m_e c = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$. The direction is -x.\n    *   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_p = (-\\sqrt{3} m_e c, 0, 0)$\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   Total Energy ($E_{tot, i}$): $E_{tot, i} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$\n    *   Total Momentum ($\\vec{p}_{tot, i}$): $\\vec{p}_{tot, i} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c, 0, 0)$\n\n**4. Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\nThe final state consists of two photons.\n\n*   **Photon Properties:** Photons are massless, and their energy-momentum relation is $E = pc$.\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   The energies of the two photons are equal: $E_{\\gamma 1} = E_{\\gamma 2} = E_\\gamma$.\n    *   This means their momentum magnitudes are also equal: $p_{\\gamma 1} = p_{\\gamma 2} = p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$.\n    *   One photon moves upper-right, the other lower-right. Let's say they make angles $+\\theta$ and $-\\theta$ with the x-axis, respectively.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation of Energy**\nThe total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n*   $E_{tot, i} = E_{tot, f}$\n*   $6 m_e c^2 = E_{\\gamma 1} + E_{\\gamma 2} = E_\\gamma + E_\\gamma = 2 E_\\gamma$\n*   Solving for the energy of each photon: $E_\\gamma = \\frac{6 m_e c^2}{2} = 3 m_e c^2$.\n*   The momentum of each photon is: $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c = 3 m_e c$.\n\n**6. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\nThe total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum. We analyze this component by component.\n\n*   **y-component:**\n    *   Initial y-momentum: $p_{tot, i, y} = 0$.\n    *   Final y-momentum: The first photon has y-momentum $p_\\gamma \\sin(\\theta)$, and the second has $p_\\gamma \\sin(-\\theta) = -p_\\gamma \\sin(\\theta)$.\n    *   $p_{tot, f, y} = p_\\gamma \\sin(\\theta) - p_\\gamma \\sin(\\theta) = 0$.\n    *   Conservation of y-momentum ($0=0$) is satisfied by our choice of symmetric angles, which is required because the photons have equal energy.\n\n*   **x-component:**\n    *   Initial x-momentum: $p_{tot, i, x} = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n    *   Final x-momentum: The first photon has x-momentum $p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$, and the second has $p_\\gamma \\cos(-\\theta) = p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$.\n    *   $p_{tot, f, x} = p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) + p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$.\n    *   Equating initial and final x-momentum: $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$.\n\n**7. Solve for the Angle**\nNow we can solve for the angle $\\theta$.\n\n*   Substitute the value of $p_\\gamma = 3 m_e c$ into the momentum equation:\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos(\\theta)$\n*   Cancel the common term $m_e c$:\n    $\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos(\\theta)$\n*   Solve for $\\cos(\\theta)$:\n    $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n*   Calculate the numerical value:\n    $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n    $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n    $\\cos(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n*   Find the angle $\\theta$:\n    $\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$\n\n**8. Determine the Angle Between the Photons**\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons. One photon's direction is at an angle $\\theta$ above the x-axis, and the other is at an angle $\\theta$ below the x-axis.\n*   The total angle between them is $\\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta$.\n*   Angle = $2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$.\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\bf{138}$ degrees.\n\n<<<A>>>"
