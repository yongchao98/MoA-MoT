    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Given Information and Species**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M.\n*   Thiocyanate ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M.\n*   Overall stability constants:\n    *   `β₁` = 9 for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `β₂` = 40 for `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   `β₃` = 63 for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `β₄` = 16 for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n*   The cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n    *   Free aquated ion: `Co²⁺`\n    *   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Equations**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants `βn`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Fraction of the Desired Complex**\nThe percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. This fraction is often denoted as `α₂`.\n\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 3 into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out `[Co²⁺]` from the expression for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)` into the formula for `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, which simplifies the calculation significantly. Note that the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed to find the percentage.\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n*   **Careful Point:** We assume the given `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M is the free ligand concentration at equilibrium. This is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   Term 0 (for `Co²⁺`): 1\n*   Term 1 (`β₁[SCN⁻]`): 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term 2 (`β₂[SCN⁻]²`): 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term 3 (`β₃[SCN⁻]³`): 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term 4 (`β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`): 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to find the value of the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex:\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 0.4\n\nCalculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nFinally, convert this fraction to a percentage:\nPercentage = `α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\nThe calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
