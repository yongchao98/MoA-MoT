    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and identify the products of decomposition.**\nThe mixture of gases formed by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.008) + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a crucial point: it means **no acidic gases** were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with any of the reagents. Given that the original salts are likely nitrogen compounds (a common theme in such problems), and no other elements are suggested, Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Summary of Products:**\nThe decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B yielded:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\nWe can find the total moles of each element (H, O, N) in the original mixture by summing the atoms from the products.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the composition and find the formulas of the salts.**\nLet's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A and also the number of moles of salt B.\nThe total moles of elements can be expressed as:\n*   n × (N atoms in A + N atoms in B) = 0.20 mol\n*   n × (H atoms in A + H atoms in B) = 0.40 mol\n*   n × (O atoms in A + O atoms in B) = 0.25 mol\n\nFrom these equations, the ratio of the total number of atoms in the combined formula unit (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The H:N ratio in the ammonium ion is 4:1. In our combined formula, the H:N ratio is 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. However, if we consider that we have two salt molecules, we can propose that each contains one ammonium cation, NH₄⁺.\n*   Two NH₄⁺ ions would account for N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ leaves N₂O₅ for the two anions.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common oxyanions of nitrogen. The most plausible combination is the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\n    *   NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻ = N₂O₅²⁻ (in terms of atoms)\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃\n\n**Step 4: Verify the decomposition reactions and molar masses.**\nLet's check if this identification is consistent with all the data.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂. Molar Mass = 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Decomposition: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃. Molar Mass = 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Decomposition at higher temperatures: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This simplifies to: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + ½O₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nNow, let's find the number of moles, n.\nTotal mass = n × (Molar Mass of A) + n × (Molar Mass of B) = 7.20 g\nn × (64 + 80) = 7.20\nn × 144 = 7.20\nn = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's check the products from this mixture:\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: 0.05 mol N₂, (0.05 × ½) = 0.025 mol O₂, and (0.05 × 2) = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n\nTotal products:\n*   N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Correct)\n*   H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Correct)\n*   O₂ = 0.025 mol (Correct)\nAll calculated values match the experimental results.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nAlternatively, using the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ we found in Step 3:\nTotal atoms = 4 (N) + 8 (H) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
