    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Problem:** The question asks for the minimum redshift (`z`) required for an astronomical object's Lyman-alpha (Lyα) absorption line to be detectable by a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **Absorption Line:** Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen.\n    *   **Rest Wavelength (λ_rest):** The Lyα line has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   **Detection Method:** Ground-based optical telescopes. This is the critical constraint.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the *lower limit* on the redshift (`z`).\n\n3.  **List Careful Points and Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Atmospheric Cutoff:** The Earth's atmosphere is not transparent to all wavelengths of light. Ozone (O3) in the upper atmosphere absorbs most of the incoming UV radiation. This creates an \"atmospheric cutoff\" for ground-based telescopes. Wavelengths shorter than this cutoff cannot be observed from the ground.\n    *   **Optical Window:** The range of wavelengths that can pass through the atmosphere is called the \"optical window.\" For ground-based astronomy, this window starts at the blue/UV end at approximately 3200 Å to 3600 Å. A common and reasonable estimate for the shortest observable wavelength is around **3500 Å**.\n    *   **Redshift (z):** Due to the expansion of the universe, light from distant objects is stretched to longer wavelengths. This phenomenon is called redshift. The relationship between the rest wavelength (λ_rest), the observed wavelength (λ_observed), and the redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n        `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n\n4.  **Connecting the Concepts for the Solution:**\n    *   The Lyα line at its rest wavelength of 1216 Å is deep in the UV and is completely blocked by the atmosphere.\n    *   For this line to be detected from the ground, it must be redshifted to a wavelength that is *inside* the optical window.\n    *   The \"lower limit\" on the redshift corresponds to the minimum shift required for the line to just enter the observable range. This means the redshifted wavelength must be equal to the shortest wavelength that can be detected from the ground (the atmospheric cutoff).\n\n### Calculation\n\n1.  **Set up the equation:** We need to find the redshift `z` that shifts `λ_rest` to the minimum observable wavelength, `λ_observed_min`.\n    `λ_observed_min = λ_rest * (1 + z_min)`\n\n2.  **Rearrange to solve for z_min:**\n    `1 + z_min = λ_observed_min / λ_rest`\n    `z_min = (λ_observed_min / λ_rest) - 1`\n\n3.  **Plug in the values:**\n    *   `λ_rest = 1216 Å`\n    *   `λ_observed_min ≈ 3500 Å` (a standard estimate for the atmospheric cutoff)\n\n4.  **Calculate the result:**\n    `z_min = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1`\n    `z_min ≈ 2.878 - 1`\n    `z_min ≈ 1.878`\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 2.4\n    *   B) 3\n    *   C) 1.9\n    *   D) 1.2\n\n    The calculated value `z ≈ 1.878` is extremely close to option C, which is 1.9.\n\n6.  **Final Check (working backwards from the options):**\n    *   If z = 1.2, λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 1.2) = 2675 Å. This is still in the UV and unobservable from the ground.\n    *   If z = 1.9, λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 3526 Å. This is just at the edge of the optical window and is observable. This is a plausible lower limit.\n    *   If z = 2.4, λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 2.4) = 4134 Å. This is well within the optical window. While an object at z=2.4 is detectable, it is not the *lowest possible* redshift for detection.\n    *   Therefore, 1.9 represents the best estimate for the lower limit.\n\n<<<C>>>"
