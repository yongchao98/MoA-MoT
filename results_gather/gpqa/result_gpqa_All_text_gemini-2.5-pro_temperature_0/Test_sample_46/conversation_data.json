    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a significant clue. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation typically corresponds to a double bond, such as a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands in the N-H stretching region is a classic signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out secondary amides (one band) and tertiary amides/amines (no bands in this region).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n    *   This frequency is typical for an **ester group conjugated with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR)**. Simple alkyl esters are usually at a slightly higher frequency (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), but conjugation lowers the frequency.\n    *   It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   It is too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760-1770 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule (n=2) means this methyl group is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Fragment:** -CH₂-CH₃\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule (n=3) means this methylene group is adjacent to the methyl (-CH₃) group identified above.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH₂ group. This high value is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-C(=O)-O-**CH₂**-).\n    *   **Fragment:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons like those on N-H or O-H groups. This signal is consistent with the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Indicates four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (lower ppm). The ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield (higher ppm). Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the structure consists of:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\nAssembling these pieces gives **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine, not amide) and NMR (para substitution pattern).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The IR C=O stretch would also be at a higher frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl group, para-substituted ring, and amine protons in the NMR.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine). It would also show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal in the NMR, which is absent.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
