    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the first part of the statement (Thermodynamics)\n\nThe first part of the statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: What determines thermodynamic strength?** The thermodynamic strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value corresponds to a stronger oxidant, meaning it has a greater tendency to be reduced (i.e., to accept electrons).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identify the relevant chemical reactions.** We need to compare the reduction of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n    *   **In acidic solution:** O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    *   **In basic solution:** O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n*   **Careful Point 3: Find the standard reduction potentials (E°).** From standard electrochemical tables:\n    *   For the acidic reaction, E° = +1.23 V.\n    *   For the basic reaction, E° = +0.40 V.\n*   **Analysis:** Comparing the two E° values, +1.23 V is significantly more positive than +0.40 V. This means that oxygen is a much stronger oxidizing agent in acidic solution than in basic solution.\n*   **Conclusion for the first blank:** The question asks about the strength in *basic* solutions. Compared to its strength in acidic solutions, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the second part of the statement (Kinetics)\n\nThe second part of the statement is: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: What determines kinetic speed?** The kinetic speed of a reaction is determined by its activation energy. In electrochemistry, this is often discussed in terms of overpotential. A high activation energy or a large overpotential means the reaction is kinetically slow.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Understand the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).** The reduction of O₂ is a four-electron transfer process. Such multi-electron transfers are typically not single-step reactions. They proceed through a complex mechanism involving intermediates, and the breaking of the strong O=O double bond requires a significant amount of energy.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Compare the reaction rates in acidic vs. basic media.** It is a well-known phenomenon in electrochemistry that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is kinetically very sluggish (slow). The overpotential for ORR is notoriously high, especially in acidic media, even on the best catalysts like platinum. The reaction mechanism in acid is complex and has a high activation barrier. In contrast, the kinetics for ORR are generally more favorable (faster) in alkaline (basic) solutions on many electrode materials.\n*   **Conclusion for the second blank:** Since the reaction has a higher overpotential and is more sluggish in acidic media, we can say that kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the conclusions and select the final answer\n\n*   From Step 1, the first word is **weaker**.\n*   From Step 2, the second word is **slower**.\n*   The correct combination is **weaker – slower**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Statement: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n*   This matches our analysis perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
