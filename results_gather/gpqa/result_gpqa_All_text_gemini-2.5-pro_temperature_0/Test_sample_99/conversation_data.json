    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final products and evaluate the given statements.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A and its reaction to form B.**\n*   **Compound A** has the molecular formula C3H6. This formula corresponds to CnH2n, which can be an alkene (propene) or a cycloalkane (cyclopropane).\n*   The reaction is bromination (addition of Br2) in CCl4. This is a classic test for unsaturation (double bonds). Alkenes readily undergo this addition reaction at room temperature, while cyclopropane requires more forcing conditions (like UV light). Therefore, **A is propene (CH3-CH=CH2)**.\n*   Propene reacts with bromine via electrophilic addition across the double bond.\n    CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n*   **Compound B** is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound C.**\n*   Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This reagent causes dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, two molecules of HBr will be eliminated to form an alkyne.\n    CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alcoholic) --> CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n*   **Compound C** is **propyne**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound D.**\n*   Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclic polymerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne will cyclize to form a substituted benzene.\n    3 CH3-C≡CH --(red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n*   **Compound D** is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**, also known as **mesitylene**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound E.**\n*   Compound D (mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This is the standard condition for nitration (conc. HNO3 + conc. H2SO4). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   The methyl groups (-CH3) are activating and ortho-, para-directing. In mesitylene, all three available positions (2, 4, and 6) are equivalent and highly activated.\n*   Nitration will add a nitro group (-NO2) to one of these positions.\n*   **Compound E** is **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify Compound F.**\n*   Compound E (2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group to an amino group.\n    -NO2 + 6[H] --(Fe/HCl)--> -NH2 + 2H2O\n*   **Compound F** is **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**, also known as **mesidine**.\n\n**Step 6: Identify Compound G.**\n*   Compound F (mesidine), a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, formed in situ from NaNO2 + HCl, typically at 0-5 °C). This reaction is diazotization.\n*   The amino group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n*   **Compound G** is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n**Step 7: Identify Compound H.**\n*   Compound G (the diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). While several reactions are possible, the most common follow-up to diazotization in introductory sequences is the replacement of the diazonium group. Warming the aqueous solution (which would be made basic by NaOH) replaces the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming a phenol.\n*   **Compound H** is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**Analysis of the Statements:**\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a violet, blue, or green color. However, phenols with bulky groups at both ortho positions (like the methyl groups in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol) are sterically hindered. This hindrance prevents the formation of the colored iron complex. Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a *negative* ferric chloride test. A negative test means no color change occurs, and the solution remains the original yellow-brown color of the FeCl3 solution. The statement that it \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading and incorrect because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow color, whereas the reality is a negative test.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature. Like other small alkynes, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, all three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, and all nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. This results in two signals. Since there are no adjacent non-equivalent protons for splitting, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is mesidine (2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for producing azo dyes, which are a large and commercially important class of colored compounds. The amine is converted to a diazonium salt (as in step G) and then coupled with another aromatic compound. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nStatements B, C, and D are correct descriptions of the properties or uses of the respective compounds. Statement A is incorrect because the described compound (H) does not give a positive ferric chloride test due to steric hindrance; it gives a negative test, where the solution simply retains the yellow color of the reagent.\n\n<<<A>>>"
