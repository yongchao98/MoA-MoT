    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required energy difference to resolve the two quantum states.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem involves the lifetime of quantum states and the ability to distinguish their energies. This directly relates to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The formula is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n3.  **Understand the Concept of \"Resolving\" Energy Levels:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguished,\" the difference in their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths (ΔE1 and ΔE2). If the energy difference is smaller than or comparable to the energy widths, the levels will overlap and appear as a single, broad peak. The level with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this width is the primary limiting factor for resolution.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ sec\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ sec\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   We have two energy widths: ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   State 1 has a shorter lifetime, so it has a larger energy uncertainty (it is \"broader\"). This broader width is the main obstacle to resolving the two levels.\n    *   To clearly distinguish the two levels, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two widths. A good rule of thumb is that the separation should be at least as large as the sum of the widths, but as a minimum condition, it must be larger than the broadest level.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: **|E1 - E2| > ΔE1**\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Given Options:** We need to find the option that satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would completely overlap. Not resolvable.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would still overlap significantly. Not clearly resolvable.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is even smaller and thus not resolvable.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than the required minimum separation (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV). With this energy difference, the two levels would be very clearly separated, as their natural widths would be negligible in comparison to their separation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Uncertainty Principle:** The core of the problem is the inverse relationship between lifetime and energy uncertainty. A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more uncertain energy.\n*   **Limiting Factor:** The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width and is therefore the limiting factor in resolving the two levels.\n*   **\"Clearly Resolved\" Condition:** This means the separation must be significantly greater than the energy widths, not just equal to or slightly larger.\n*   **Units:** Ensure consistent units. The Planck constant was used in eV·s to directly obtain the energy uncertainty in eV, which matches the units of the options.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe energy width of the broader state is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly resolve the two states, their energy difference must be significantly larger than this value. Among the given options, only 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
