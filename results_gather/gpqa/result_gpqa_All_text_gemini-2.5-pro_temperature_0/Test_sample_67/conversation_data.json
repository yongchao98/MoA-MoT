    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Determine the Initial State (at t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin is described by the spin operator **S**.\n    *   The magnetic moment is given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is μ_z = γS_z.\n    *   Initially, the magnetic field is **B** = B**ẑ** (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this situation is H_initial = -**μ** · **B** = - (γ**S**) · (B**ẑ**) = -γBS_z.\n    *   The eigenstates of S_z are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue +ħ/2) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue -ħ/2).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means it is in the lowest possible energy state. Assuming γ and B are positive, the lowest energy is E_up.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at t=0 is the spin-up state along the z-axis: `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Determine the New Hamiltonian (for t > 0):**\n    *   At t=0, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The old field is turned off, and a new field **B'** = B**ŷ** (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n    *   The term \"suddenly\" implies that the state of the system does not have time to change at the moment of the switch. So, the state at t=0+ is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n    *   For all t > 0, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian: H_new = -**μ** · **B'** = - (γ**S**) · (B**ŷ**) = -γBS_y.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution of the State (for t > 0):**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for H_new and `|ψ(0)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γBS_y) * t / ħ) * |+z>`\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ) * |+z>`\n    *   This equation describes the precession of the spin vector, which was initially pointing along the +Z axis, around the new magnetic field direction (the +Y axis). The angular velocity of this precession is the Larmor frequency, ω_L = γB.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Observable:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ * <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   To calculate this, we can express the initial state `|+z>` in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian (i.e., the eigenstates of S_y).\n    *   The eigenstates of S_y are `|+y>` and `|-y>`. In the S_z basis:\n        `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    *   We can write the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of `|+y>` and `|-y>`:\n        `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    *   The energies corresponding to the S_y eigenstates are:\n        E_{+y} = -γB(ħ/2)\n        E_{-y} = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)\n    *   Now, we evolve the state in time:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iE_{+y}t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_{-y}t/ħ)|-y>]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y>]`\n    *   To find `<S_z>(t)`, we substitute the S_y eigenstates back in terms of S_z eigenstates. After some algebra (using Euler's formula `cos(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2` and `sin(x) = (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})/(2i)`), we get:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now we can calculate `<S_z>(t)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] * S_z * [cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] * [cos(γBt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   The time-dependent part of this expression is `cos(γBt)`.\n    *   An oscillation of the form `cos(Ωt)` has an angular frequency of `Ω`.\n    *   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(Ωt)`, we can see that the oscillation frequency is `Ω = γB`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **\"Aligned with the field\"**: This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n*   **\"Suddenly\"**: This is the key to using the sudden approximation, which states that the wavefunction does not change at the instant the Hamiltonian changes.\n*   **Observable**: The question asks for the oscillation of the *average of the z-component of the moment* (`<μ_z>`), not the spin (`<S_z>`). However, since they are related by a constant factor (`γ`), their oscillation frequency is the same.\n*   **Frequency**: In physics, \"frequency\" in this context almost always refers to the angular frequency (in radians per second), not the ordinary frequency (in Hertz). The options confirm this. The phenomenon described is Larmor precession, and the frequency `γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates as `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function.\n\nOscillation Frequency = γB\n\n<<<B>>>"
