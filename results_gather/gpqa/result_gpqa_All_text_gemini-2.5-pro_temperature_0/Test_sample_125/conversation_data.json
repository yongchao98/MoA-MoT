    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5).\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C3. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule. It has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, these enantiomers will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Key Point:** It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity). It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, we have a racemic mixture of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different polarity and elute separately, giving another **1 peak**. This results in a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (different molecular weight, different functional groups), so their peaks will not overlap.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Key Point:** It can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The combined product mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since a chiral column can resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers, each one will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
