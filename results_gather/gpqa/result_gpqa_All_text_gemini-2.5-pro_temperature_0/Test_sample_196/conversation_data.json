    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, far downfield, is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.2 ppm are adjacent to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl group analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to identify the alkyl substituent.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group next to a -CH₂ group (CH₃-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group next to a -CH group (-CH-CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this must be the -CH₂- group. It is adjacent to the -CH₃ group and also to the -CH group, which would make its signal a complex multiplet.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This is the -CH group. It is attached to the aromatic ring (making it a benzylic proton), the -CH₃ group (1.4 ppm), and the -CH₂- group (1.7 ppm). Its signal is split by all these neighboring protons (3+2=5), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are Ring-CH-, -CH₃, -CH₂-, and -CH₃. Putting them together based on the splitting patterns gives: Ring-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the analysis, Compound X is a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with red phosphorus and HI (Red P / HI).\n*   **Reagent's Function:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of many oxygen-containing functional groups to the corresponding alkane. Specifically, it reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Reaction Transformation:**\n    *   The aromatic ring is stable and will not be reduced under these conditions.\n    *   The sec-butyl group is an alkyl group and will not be changed.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\n*   Starting with 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   Reduce the -COOH group at position 1 to a -CH₃ group.\n*   The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n*   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
