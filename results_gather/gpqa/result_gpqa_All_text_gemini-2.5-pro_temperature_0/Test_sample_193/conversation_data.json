    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z for the given system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Understand the Energy Function**\n\n*   The energy of any given state is determined by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n*   We need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible microstates.\n\n**3. Define the Partition Function**\n\n*   The canonical partition function (Z) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible microstates:\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n    where β = 1/(kT).\n*   A more efficient way to calculate this is to group states with the same energy (degeneracy) and sum them up:\n    Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i)\n    where g_i is the degeneracy (number of states) of the energy level E_i.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet's list all 8 states, calculate the term [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], and then find the energy E for each state.\n\n| State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 | S1S3 | S2S3 | Sum = [S1S2+S1S3+S2S3] | Energy E = -J * Sum |\n| :---: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--------------------: | :------------------: |\n|   1   | +1 | +1 | +1 |  +1  |  +1  |  +1  |           +3           |         -3J          |\n|   2   | +1 | +1 | -1 |  +1  |  -1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   3   | +1 | -1 | +1 |  -1  |  +1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   4   | -1 | +1 | +1 |  -1  |  -1  |  +1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   5   | +1 | -1 | -1 |  -1  |  -1  |  +1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   6   | -1 | +1 | -1 |  -1  |  +1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   7   | -1 | -1 | +1 |  +1  |  -1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   8   | -1 | -1 | -1 |  +1  |  +1  |  +1  |           +3           |         -3J          |\n\n**5. Group States by Energy (Find Degeneracy)**\n\nFrom the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels.\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E1):**\n    *   E1 = -3J\n    *   The states with this energy are State 1 (+1, +1, +1) and State 8 (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E2):**\n    *   E2 = +J\n    *   The states with this energy are States 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g2 = 6.\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to miscalculate the number of states for each energy level. It's crucial to list all 8 states or use combinatorics (e.g., \"all spins up/down\" vs. \"one spin flipped\") to correctly determine the degeneracies. Here, the total number of states is 2 + 6 = 8, which confirms we have accounted for all possibilities.\n\n**6. Construct the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = Σ g_i * e^(-βE_i).\n\n*   Contribution from E1: g1 * e^(-βE1) = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ)\n*   Contribution from E2: g2 * e^(-βE2) = 6 * e^(-β(+J)) = 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**7. Final Answer Selection**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
