    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture**\nThe problem describes an aperture in the shape of an N-sided regular polygon. A key piece of information is that all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. The problem asks us to consider the case where the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞).\n\n*   **Careful Point:** As N increases, a regular polygon with a fixed apothem 'a' increasingly resembles a circle. In the limit as N → ∞, the polygon becomes a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n*   **Conclusion:** The problem is equivalent to analyzing diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon**\nThe problem states that monochromatic light falls on the aperture and creates an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\".\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Diffraction in the far-field region is known as Fraunhofer diffraction.\n*   **Conclusion:** We need to use the principles of Fraunhofer diffraction for a circular aperture.\n\n**Step 3: Recall the Formula for Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture**\nThe intensity distribution of the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity I as a function of the diffraction angle θ is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ))) / (k * a * sin(θ)) ]²\nwhere:\n*   I₀ is the intensity at the center of the pattern (the central maximum).\n*   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   k is the wave number, k = 2π/λ.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   θ is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Condition for Intensity Minima**\nThe intensity minima (dark rings in the pattern) occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, provided the denominator is not also zero. This means the minima are located at angles θ where J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The Bessel function J₁(x) has its first zero at x = 0, but this corresponds to the central maximum, not a minimum (because lim(x→0) [J₁(x)/x] = 1/2). The minima correspond to the subsequent, non-zero roots of J₁(x).\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Small Angle Approximation**\nThe problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ. The condition for minima becomes:\nJ₁(k * a * θ) = 0\nSubstituting k = 2π/λ, we get:\nJ₁((2π * a * θ) / λ) = 0\n\nLet z = (2π * a * θ) / λ. The minima occur at angles θ_n that satisfy z = z_n, where z_n are the non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(z).\n\n**Step 6: Find the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**\nWe need the values of the first two non-zero roots of J₁(z). From mathematical tables or computation:\n*   First non-zero root: z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   Second non-zero root: z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions (θ₁ and θ₂) of the first two minima:\nFor the first minimum (n=1):\n(2π * a * θ₁) / λ = z₁ ≈ 3.8317\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ/a ≈ 0.610 * λ/a\n\nFor the second minimum (n=2):\n(2π * a * θ₂) / λ = z₂ ≈ 7.0156\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ/a\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 * λ/a) - (0.6098 * λ/a)\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ/a\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ/a\n\nAlternatively, using the roots directly:\nΔθ = (z₂ * λ / (2π * a)) - (z₁ * λ / (2π * a))\nΔθ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ ≈ (3.1839) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ/a\n\n**Step 8: Compare the Result with the Given Options**\nThe calculated value is Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ/a. Let's examine the options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nOur calculated value matches option B almost perfectly.\n\n*   **Final Careful Point Check:** Option D (0.610 λ/a) represents the angular position of the *first* minimum, not the distance between the first two. Option C (1.220 λ/a) is related to the Rayleigh criterion for a diameter D=a, which is incorrect as 'a' is the radius. Option A (0.500 λ/a) would result from an approximation that the spacing between Bessel function roots is π, which is only true for very large roots. Since we are dealing with the first two roots, the more precise calculation is required.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is 0.506 λ/a.\n\n<<<B>>>"
