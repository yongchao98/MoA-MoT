    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused to a cyclopropane ring. The `7-oxa` indicates that the single-atom bridge of the cyclopropane is an oxygen atom, forming an epoxide fused to the cyclohexane ring. The fusion points are C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations are given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\nLet's visualize the structure. We can draw the cyclohexane ring with the epoxide fused to it. The stereochemistry at C1 and C6 determines that the epoxide ring is cis-fused. Let's assume the oxygen atom is on the 'up' (beta) face of the ring.\n*   At **C1**, which is `R`, the C1-O bond is 'up'. For it to be R, the methyl group at C1 must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C6**, which is `S`, the C6-O bond is 'up'. For it to be S, the hydrogen atom at C6 must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C3**, which is `R`, the methyl group must be 'down' (alpha).\n*   At **C4**, which is `R`, the methyl group must also be 'down' (alpha).\n\nSo, the starting epoxide has the oxygen atom on one face, and all three methyl groups are on the opposite face.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Type**\n\nThe reagent is **Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate)**, a Gilman reagent.\n*   This reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\n\nThe problem states a key rule for organocuprates reacting with epoxides: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n*   Clearly, C6 is sterically less hindered than C1.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur at **C6**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**. The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   This means the nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken (the backside).\n*   In our structure, the C6-O bond is on the 'up' face.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile must attack C6 from the **'down' face**.\n*   This attack breaks the C6-O bond and causes an **inversion of configuration** at C6. The hydrogen atom at C6, which was 'down', is pushed to the 'up' position. The new methyl group is added to the 'down' position.\n*   The C1-O bond also breaks (after the initial attack), and upon aqueous workup, the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configuration at C1 is retained.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Structure and Name of the Product**\n\nLet's summarize the resulting structure:\n*   The cyclohexane ring is opened to form a cyclohexanol.\n*   The hydroxyl group (-OH) is at the original C1 position, and its stereochemistry is retained ('up').\n*   The methyl group at the original C1 position remains 'down'.\n*   The methyl groups at C3 and C4 remain 'down'.\n*   A new methyl group is added at the original C6 position and is 'down'.\n\nNow, we must name this product according to IUPAC rules:\n*   **Parent Name:** The main functional group is the alcohol, so it is a `cyclohexanol`. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Starting from the OH-carbon as C1, numbering counter-clockwise (towards the original C6) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give locants {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower, so we use this numbering scheme.\n*   **Full Name (without stereochemistry):** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe need to determine the R/S configuration for the chiral centers in the product: C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n*   **New C1 (original C1):** The configuration is retained. It was R in the starting material. So, it is **1R**.\n*   **New C2 (original C6):** The configuration is inverted due to the Sₙ2 attack. The original configuration was S. One might assume it becomes R, but we must re-evaluate using CIP rules because the substituent priorities have changed.\n    *   At New C2, the groups are H ('up'), Me ('down'), C1, and C3.\n    *   Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing towards us ('up'), we trace the path from C1 → C3 → Me, which is clockwise. A clockwise path with the lowest priority group towards the viewer means the configuration is **S**. So, it is **2S**.\n*   **New C4 (original C4):** The configuration is retained. It was R. So, it is **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (original C3):** The configuration is retained. It was R. So, it is **5R**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
