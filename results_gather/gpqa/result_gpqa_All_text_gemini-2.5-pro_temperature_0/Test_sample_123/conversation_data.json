    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the decay of unstable particles. The number of particles, N, that have not decayed after a certain time is described by the exponential decay law. This law is most fundamentally expressed in the particle's own rest frame. The connection between the particle's rest frame and the laboratory frame (the detector) is made through the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Decay Equation:**\n    *   In the particle's rest frame, the number of particles remaining after a proper time `t'` is given by:\n        `N(t') = N₀ * exp(-t' / τ)`\n        where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive is `N/N₀ = exp(-t' / τ)`.\n\n3.  **Relate Lab Frame and Rest Frame (Time Dilation):**\n    *   The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel a distance `R` (the radius) to reach the inner wall.\n    *   In the lab frame, the time taken for this journey is `t_lab = R / v`, where `v` is the particle's velocity.\n    *   The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\", so we can approximate their velocity `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). Thus, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame (`t'`). The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `t_lab = γ * t'`\n    *   Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle during its journey to the detector wall is:\n        `t' = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n\n4.  **Combine Decay and Relativity:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for the proper time `t'` into the survival fraction equation:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n    *   The term `c*τ` is the mean distance a particle travels in its rest frame during its mean proper lifetime. This is a constant property of the particle. Let's call the constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. The equation simplifies to:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n5.  **Use the Initial Condition to Find the Constant K:**\n    *   We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   Plugging these values into our equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    *   Now we need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` required for two thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n    *   `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   Using the same survival equation with the new values:\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n        `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `K` we found in the previous step:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Distinguish Frames:** It is crucial to correctly distinguish between the proper time `t'` in the particle's rest frame and the observed time `t_lab` in the laboratory frame. The decay law exponent must use the proper time.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and simplifies the calculation of the lab-frame travel time.\n*   **Constant Property:** The mean proper lifetime `τ` (and thus the product `c*τ`) is an intrinsic property of the particle type and does not change when the particle's energy (and thus `γ`) changes.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<A>>>"
