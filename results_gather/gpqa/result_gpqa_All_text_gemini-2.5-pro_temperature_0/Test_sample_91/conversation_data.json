    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and count the atoms.**\nThe given molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   Carbons (C):\n    *   (CH3)2C: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in the methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   =CH-: 1 C\n    *   -CH2-: 1 C\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 C in the chain + 1 C in the methyl group = 2 C\n    *   -CH2-: 1 C\n    *   -CH=: 1 C\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in the methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 C.\n*   Hydrogens (H):\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   =CH-: 1 H\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 H in the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH=: 1 H\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H.\nThe molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n**Step 2: Count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.**\nTo calculate the total bond energy of the molecule, we need to count every bond.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure contains two double bonds: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -CH**=C**(CH3)2. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds (single bonds):** We need to count all the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   In (CH3)2C=, there are two C-C bonds connecting the two methyl groups to the chain.\n    *   In =CH-CH2-, there is one C-C bond.\n    *   In -CH2-CH(CH3)-, there is one C-C bond.\n    *   In -CH(CH3)-, there is one C-C bond connecting the methyl group to the chain.\n    *   In -CH-CH2-, there is one C-C bond.\n    *   In -CH2-CH=, there is one C-C bond.\n    *   In =C(CH3)2, there are two C-C bonds connecting the two methyl groups to the chain.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9 C-C bonds.\n\n**Careful Point Check:** We can verify the bond count using the sum of valencies. The sum of valencies of all atoms must equal twice the sum of bonds (considering bond order).\nSum of valencies = (12 C atoms * 4) + (22 H atoms * 1) = 48 + 22 = 70.\nSum of valencies from bonds = (9 C-C bonds * 2) + (2 C=C bonds * 4) + (22 C-H bonds * 2) = 18 + 8 + 44 = 70.\nThe counts match, so our bond count is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°).**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The reaction is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe formula for calculating ΔHf° from bond energies is:\nΔHf° = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)]\n\n*   **Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants:**\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants to form gaseous atoms.\n    Reactants are 12 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H2(g).\n    Energy_in = [12 * ΔH_atom(C)] + [11 * BE(H-H)]\n    Using the given values:\n    Energy_in = [12 * 1000 kJ/mol] + [11 * 100 kJ/mol]\n    Energy_in = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ.\n\n*   **Calculate the total bond energy of the product (C12H22):**\n    This is the energy released when all the bonds in one mole of the product are formed from gaseous atoms.\n    Energy_out = [9 * BE(C-C)] + [2 * BE(C=C)] + [22 * BE(C-H)]\n    Using the given values:\n    Energy_out = [9 * 200] + [2 * 300] + [22 * 400]\n    Energy_out = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ.\n\n*   **Calculate the enthalpy of formation:**\n    ΔHf° = Energy_in - Energy_out\n    ΔHf° = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ = 1900 kJ.\n    This value is for one mole of the product, so ΔHf° = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the result with the given options.**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 11.44 kJ/g\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 1900 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value in kJ/mol (1900) does not match option B or D. Option C has the correct number but the wrong unit (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Let's convert our answer to kJ/g to check option A.\n\n*   **Calculate the molar mass of C12H22:**\n    Molar Mass = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\n*   **Convert ΔHf° from kJ/mol to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option A (11.44 kJ/g).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<A>>>"
