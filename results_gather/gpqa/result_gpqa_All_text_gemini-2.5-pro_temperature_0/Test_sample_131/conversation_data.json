    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds in the mixture have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   **Options:**\n    1.  1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n    2.  1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n    3.  1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n    4.  1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Molecular Formula of the Options**\n\n*   **Tetramethylbenzene:** The formula is C6H2(CH3)4. The total number of carbons is 6 + 4 = 10. The total number of hydrogens is 2 + (4 * 3) = 14. The formula is C10H14. This applies to options 1, 2, and 3.\n*   **Diethylbenzene:** The formula is C6H4(C2H5)2. The total number of carbons is 6 + (2 * 2) = 10. The total number of hydrogens is 4 + (2 * 5) = 14. The formula is C10H14. This applies to option 4.\n*   **Conclusion:** All four compounds have the correct molecular formula.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n*   **1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. There are two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 signals total (one 2H aromatic singlet, one 12H alkyl singlet).\n\n*   **2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Less symmetrical. There is one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 5 signals total (two 1H aromatic singlets, three alkyl singlets with 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent (ortho) to each other. While they would technically couple, in such a symmetrical environment (an AA' system), they often appear as a **single singlet** (or a narrow multiplet that looks like a singlet). The integration is **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one 2H aromatic singlet, two 6H alkyl singlets).\n\n*   **4. 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The protons within the ethyl group are not.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet** (split by the -CH3) with an integration of **4H**.\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be a **triplet** (split by the -CH2-) with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one aromatic singlet, one alkyl quartet, one alkyl triplet). This is immediately ruled out because the problem states all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that produces the observed spectrum. We can eliminate any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene (Option C) because it would produce a quartet and a triplet. We are left with options A, B, and D.\n\nLet's test the remaining combinations:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" observation.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. If these two singlets have different chemical shifts, the combined spectrum will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. In a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio is **1:1**. **This matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the aliphatic data.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" observation.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB give two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the two 6H singlets from 1,2,3,4-TMB give three singlets in a 12:6:6 or 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
