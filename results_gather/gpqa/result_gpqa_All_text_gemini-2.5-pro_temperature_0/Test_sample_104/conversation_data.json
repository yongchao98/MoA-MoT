    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to its host star.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Scenario and the Goal**\n\n*   **The Star:** We have a star with a temperature (T_eff) of 6000 K. One of its hemispheres is partially covered by cooler spots.\n*   **The Spots:** The spots have a temperature (T_spot) that is 1000 K cooler than the star's surface, so T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K. The \"filling factor\" (f) of these spots on the affected hemisphere is 20% or 0.2.\n*   **The Observation:** As the star rotates, we observe a periodic change in its brightness. The brightness is maximum when the unspotted hemisphere faces us and minimum when the spotted hemisphere faces us.\n*   **The Analogy:** We need to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet (relative to the star's radius, R_pl/R_star) that would cause the same change in brightness during a transit.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Variation Caused by the Starspots**\n\nThe brightness (or more accurately, the flux) of a star is determined by its temperature and visible area, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (Flux ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the clean, unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has a temperature T_eff.\n    *   F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴\n    where A_disk is the projected area of the star's disk (πR_star²).\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. A fraction `f` of the visible disk is covered by cooler spots, while the remaining fraction (1-f) is at the normal temperature T_eff.\n    *   The flux comes from two components: the unspotted part and the spotted part.\n    *   Flux from unspotted part ∝ (1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴\n    *   Flux from spotted part ∝ f * A_disk * T_spot⁴\n    *   F_min = [(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴] + [f * A_disk * T_spot⁴]\n\n*   **Calculate the Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in flux.\n    *   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    *   Substituting the expressions for F_max and F_min:\n        Amplitude = 1 - { ([(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴] + [f * A_disk * T_spot⁴]) / (A_disk * T_eff⁴) }\n    *   The A_disk term cancels out:\n        Amplitude = 1 - { (1 - f) + f * (T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴) }\n        Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴)\n        Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n*   **Plug in the numerical values:**\n    *   f = 0.20\n    *   T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   T_spot = 5000 K\n    *   Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n    *   Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n    *   Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (625 / 1296)]\n    *   Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\n    *   Amplitude = 0.20 * 0.51775\n    *   Amplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\n**3. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Size**\n\nThe drop in brightness caused by an exoplanet transit (the \"transit depth\") is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star\n*   Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n*   Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**4. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve for the Radius Ratio**\n\nWe need the transit depth from the hypothetical planet to be equal to the amplitude of the variation from the starspots.\n\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spots\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n*   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n*   R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **T⁴ Dependence:** The most critical point is remembering that flux scales with the fourth power of temperature (T⁴), not linearly with T.\n*   **Amplitude Definition:** The amplitude is the *relative* flux change (ΔF/F_max), not the absolute change.\n*   **Filling Factor:** The filling factor `f` applies to the projected area of the star's disk when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n*   **Transit Depth Formula:** The transit depth is proportional to the ratio of the *areas* (R²), not the radii (R). A final square root is necessary to find the radius ratio.\n*   **Temperature Difference:** Ensure you use the correct spot temperature (T_eff - 1000 K), not 1000 K itself.\n\nThe final answer is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
