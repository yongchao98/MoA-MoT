    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring with a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate. One of the α-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, both α-positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a base. While elimination to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone is possible, the presence of an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position, C6) strongly favors a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic α'-proton from C6 to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction: the carbanion at C6 attacks C2, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻) to form a strained bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the ring opens by cleaving the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α'-carbon (C6). This relieves the strain of the three-membered ring and results in the formation of a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  Upon acidic workup (which is implied before the next step), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Note:* If simple elimination had occurred, the product would be cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, this compound would not react with thionyl chloride in the next step, making the Favorskii rearrangement the only logical pathway consistent with the entire reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a selective reduction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a sterically hindered and less reactive hydride donor than LiAlH₄. It is known to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (puckering). On the NMR time scale, this results in an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the C-CHO bond, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the midpoint of the opposite C-C bond (the C3-C4 bond).\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** type.\n    2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring attached to the aldehyde group (C1) lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is a **2nd** type.\n    3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic (one is cis to the -CHO group, the other is trans). They are not chemically equivalent to each other. Therefore, the two hydrogens on C2/C5 constitute two different sets of equivalent protons. This gives **2** more types.\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. This gives another **2** types.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Type 1: Aldehyde-H (1H)\n    *   Type 2: C1-H (1H)\n    *   Type 3: C2-H & C5-H (cis) (2H total)\n    *   Type 4: C2-H & C5-H (trans) (2H total)\n    *   Type 5: C3-H & C4-H (one set) (2H total)\n    *   Type 6: C3-H & C4-H (the other set) (2H total)\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
