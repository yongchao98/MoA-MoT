    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray to annihilate with a CMB photon.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physical Process**\nThe process in question is pair production from the collision of two photons:\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is a high-energy gamma-ray, $\\gamma_{CMB}$ is a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background, and $e^{+}$ and $e^{-}$ are the resulting positron and electron.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Threshold Condition**\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products (an electron-positron pair). The rest mass of an electron is $m_e$, and the rest mass of a positron is also $m_e$.\nThe threshold condition is when the minimum required energy is supplied, resulting in the electron and positron being created with zero kinetic energy in the CM frame.\nSo, the total energy in the CM frame, $E_{CM}$, must satisfy:\n$E_{CM} \\ge 2m_e c^2$\nThe threshold energy corresponds to the equality:\n$E_{CM, threshold} = 2m_e c^2$\n\n**Step 3: Use Lorentz Invariance**\nThe square of the total four-momentum, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames.\n$s = (P_1 + P_2)^2$, where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the four-momenta of the two photons.\n\nIn the CM frame, at threshold, the total momentum is zero, and the total energy is $2m_e c^2$. The four-momentum is $P_{CM} = (E_{CM}/c, \\vec{0}) = (2m_e c, \\vec{0})$.\nSo, $s = (P_{CM})^2 = (2m_e c)^2 = 4m_e^2 c^2$.\n\nIn the lab frame (the frame of the universe), let the high-energy photon have energy $E_\\gamma$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_\\gamma$, and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_{CMB}$.\nThe four-momenta are $P_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma/c, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ and $P_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}/c, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$.\n$s = (P_\\gamma + P_{CMB})^2 = P_\\gamma^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2 P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB}$\nFor photons, which are massless, $P^2 = 0$. So, $P_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $P_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n$s = 2 P_\\gamma \\cdot P_{CMB} = 2 \\left( \\frac{E_\\gamma E_{CMB}}{c^2} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} \\right)$\nSince for a photon $|\\vec{p}| = E/c$, we have $\\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_\\gamma| |\\vec{p}_{CMB}| \\cos\\theta = \\frac{E_\\gamma E_{CMB}}{c^2} \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n$s = 2 \\frac{E_\\gamma E_{CMB}}{c^2} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Minimum Threshold Energy**\nEquating the expressions for $s$ from the CM and lab frames:\n$4m_e^2 c^2 = 2 \\frac{E_\\gamma E_{CMB}}{c^2} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\nSolving for the high-energy photon's energy, $E_\\gamma$:\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_e^2 c^4}{E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)}$\n\nThe question asks for the energy from which the lifetime is limited. This implies finding the lowest possible energy for this interaction to occur, which is the energy threshold. To find the minimum $E_\\gamma$, we need to maximize the denominator, specifically the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\nThe maximum value of $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is $1 - (-1) = 2$, which occurs when $\\cos\\theta = -1$, i.e., $\\theta = 180^\\circ$. This corresponds to a head-on collision, which is the most energetically efficient configuration for pair production.\n\nSubstituting $\\cos\\theta = -1$ into the equation for $E_\\gamma$:\n$E_{\\gamma, threshold} = \\frac{2 m_e^2 c^4}{E_{CMB}(2)} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Numerical Value**\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Average photon energy of the CMB, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow, we plug these values into our derived formula:\n$E_{\\gamma, threshold} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, threshold} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, threshold} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, threshold} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n**Step 6: Convert to the Required Units and Compare**\nThe options are given in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$). Let's convert our result:\n$E_{\\gamma, threshold} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, threshold} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nD) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nOur calculated value matches option B.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The use of Lorentz invariance is a standard and powerful technique in relativistic kinematics.\n*   The minimum energy threshold for the incoming gamma-ray corresponds to the maximum energy transfer in the collision, which is a head-on collision ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$).\n*   It is crucial to use the physical constants and given values accurately, paying close attention to units (eV, MeV, GeV) and powers of ten.\n*   The question implies finding the energy at which the process becomes possible, which is the threshold energy.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} = 2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
