    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine which planet has a higher transit probability.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, and find the ratio of their probabilities to select the best candidate for observation.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Formula**\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star, assuming a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n\n*   `Probability (P_transit) = R_s / a`\n\n**3. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities**\nWe are not given the semi-major axis (`a`) directly. However, we are given the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_s`). We can use Kepler's Third Law to establish a relationship between these variables.\n\n*   Kepler's Third Law: `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n*   Rearranging to solve for `a`: `a³ ∝ P² * M_s`\n*   Therefore, the semi-major axis is proportional to: `a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\n**4. Combine Formulas to Find the Probability Relationship**\nNow, we substitute the expression for `a` into the transit probability formula:\n\n*   `P_transit ∝ R_s / a`\n*   `P_transit ∝ R_s / (P² * M_s)^(1/3)`\n*   `P_transit ∝ R_s * P^(-2/3) * M_s^(-1/3)`\n\nThis final proportionality shows how the transit probability depends on the star's radius, the planet's orbital period, and the star's mass.\n\n**5. List the Given Information as Ratios**\nLet's summarize the information provided in the question as ratios between Planet_1 and Planet_2 systems.\n\n*   **Stellar Radii:** Both host stars have the same radii.\n    *   `R_s1 = R_s2`  or `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n*   **Stellar Masses:** The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as the star hosting Planet_2.\n    *   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` or `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`\n*   **Orbital Periods:** The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2.\n    *   `P_1 = P_2 / 3` or `P_1 / P_2 = 1/3`\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio of Transit Probabilities**\nWe will now calculate the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (`P_transit1`) to that of Planet_2 (`P_transit2`).\n\n*   `Ratio = P_transit1 / P_transit2`\n*   Using the proportionality from Step 4:\n    `Ratio = [R_s1 * P_1^(-2/3) * M_s1^(-1/3)] / [R_s2 * P_2^(-2/3) * M_s2^(-1/3)]`\n*   Group the terms into ratios:\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (P_1 / P_2)^(-2/3) * (M_s1 / M_s2)^(-1/3)`\n*   This can be rewritten to avoid negative exponents:\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3)`\n\n**7. Substitute the Known Values into the Ratio Formula**\nNow, plug the values from Step 5 into the equation.\n\n*   `Ratio = (1) * (3)^(2/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)`\n*   Let's simplify the expression:\n    `Ratio = (3²) ^ (1/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (9)^(1/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (9 * 1/2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\nCalculate the cube root of 4.5.\n\n*   `Ratio ≈ 1.65096...`\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the ratio is `~1.65`.\n\n**9. Conclusion**\nThe ratio `P_transit1 / P_transit2` is approximately 1.65. This means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
