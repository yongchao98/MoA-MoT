    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton.\n*   **Inference:** The alpha-proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since it's the same proton on the same molecule, this implies the molecule itself exists in two different, stable forms.\n*   **Observation:** The peaks have roughly equal integrals, which sum to the expected integral of one proton (1H).\n*   **Inference:** The two forms of the molecule are present in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Observation:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out.\n*   **Inference:** The splitting is not due to coupling with adjacent protons. It confirms the presence of two distinct molecular species, each giving rise to its own signal for that alpha-proton.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the LC-MS Data**\n\n*   **Observation:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) shows two clearly defined peaks.\n*   **Inference:** This confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species that have different interactions with the chromatography column and can therefore be separated.\n*   **Observation:** The two LC peaks have equal intensities.\n*   **Inference:** This corroborates the NMR data, confirming the two species are present in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Observation:** Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule.\n*   **Inference:** This is a crucial point. It proves that the two species are isomers (they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass). It rules out impurities that have a different molecular weight, such as precursors or byproducts from side reactions like double coupling.\n*   **Observation:** The analysis is performed at an elevated temperature.\n*   **Inference:** This suggests the two isomers might be interconverting (conformational isomers or rotamers). At room temperature, this interconversion might be slow enough to cause broad peaks in NMR but too fast to be resolved by LC. Elevating the temperature can sometimes \"freeze\" the conformations on the chromatographic timescale, allowing for their separation into sharp peaks. In the context of peptides, this often points to *cis-trans* isomerism around an amide bond (especially involving proline), where the isomers are called rotamers.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Proposed Explanations**\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight. The MS data shows both peaks have the same, expected mass. This option is incorrect.\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished by standard ¹H NMR (they would show a single set of peaks) or separated by a standard (achiral) LC column (they would elute as a single peak). This option is incorrect.\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This means an extra amino acid was accidentally added. The resulting molecule would have a higher molecular weight than the expected product. The MS data shows the expected mass. This option is incorrect.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   They give different signals in an NMR spectrum.\n    *   They can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography.\n    *   They have the same molecular formula and mass.\n    This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the observations. The two species are isomers (same mass) that are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR. In peptide chemistry, diastereomers can arise from epimerization at a chiral center during synthesis or, very commonly, from the presence of stable *cis* and *trans* rotamers around an amide bond. These rotamers are, by definition, diastereomers (assuming other chiral centers exist in the peptide), and their slow interconversion explains all the observed phenomena.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence strongly points to the presence of two diastereomeric forms of the peptide, which are present in a 1:1 ratio. They have the same mass but different structures, leading to distinct signals in both NMR and LC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
