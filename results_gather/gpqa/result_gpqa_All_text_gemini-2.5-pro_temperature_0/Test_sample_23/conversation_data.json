    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\nLet the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H).\nUsing approximate atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1), we have:\ny / (12x + y) = 0.1428\ny = 0.1428 * (12x + y)\ny = 1.7136x + 0.1428y\n0.8572y = 1.7136x\ny/x ≈ 2\nThis gives an empirical formula of CH2.\nThe general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon is either CnH2n+2 (for an alkane) or CnH2n (for a cycloalkane). Since the empirical formula is CH2, the molecular formula must be of the form CnH2n. This indicates that Z is a cycloalkane.\nLet's verify the mass fraction for CnH2n:\nMass % H = (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) = 2.016n / 14.027n ≈ 0.1437, which is very close to 14.28% (1/7 ≈ 0.142857). So, Z is indeed a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify hydrocarbon Z and mixture Y.**\n*   Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n) widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all components of X and Y have a carbon skeleton that can be converted to the skeleton of Z upon hydrogenation. If Z is cyclohexane, all components must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from X, does not decolorize bromine water, and contains Z as one of its components. Let Y = {Z, W}.\n*   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, both Z and W must be saturated compounds (or aromatic, which also doesn't react with bromine water).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Z gives Z (no reaction), and hydrogenation of W must also give Z.\n*   This leads to a crucial point. If W is a saturated cycloalkane isomer of Z (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation to Z would involve skeletal rearrangement, which is possible under \"severe conditions\". However, let's consider the disproportionation reaction first.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the disproportionation reaction and identify mixture X.**\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y. This is a disproportionation.\n*   Let the two components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B. Let the two components of the equimolar mixture Y be Z and W.\n*   The reaction is: A + B → Z + W (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   This is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule is hydrogenated (reduced) and the other is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   We know Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). So, one product is saturated.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means W must also not react with bromine water. A highly unsaturated but stable aromatic compound like benzene (C6H6) fits this description. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Let's test this hypothesis: Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is already saturated. Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12). So, hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits the condition.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. This fits.\n*   Now we can deduce A and B from the reaction: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   The total atoms on the product side are C12H18. This must be the same for the reactants A + B.\n    *   A and B are in an equimolar mixture, and their hydrogenation both yield cyclohexane. This means A and B must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Let's find two C6 cyclic alkenes, A and B, that sum to C12H18. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   If we take A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total formula is C10H10 + C6H8 = C12H18. This matches the products.\n    *   The problem specifies no conjugated bonds. 1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated. Therefore, the diene must be 1,4-Cyclohexadiene.\n*   So, let's finalize the identities:\n    *   **Mixture X** = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}\n    *   **Mixture Y** = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n    *   **Substance Z** = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n\n**Step 4: Verify all conditions.**\n*   **X**: Equimolar mixture of two liquids (C6H10, C6H8). Decolorizes Br2 water (due to C=C). No conjugated bonds (1,4-diene is not conjugated). **(Checks out)**\n*   **Reaction**: C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6. This is a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) yielding an equimolar mixture Y. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Y**: Equimolar mixture of two liquids (C6H12, C6H6). Does not decolorize Br2 water (cyclohexane is saturated, benzene is unreactive). **(Checks out)**\n*   **Hydrogenation of X**: C6H10 + H2 → C6H12. C6H8 + 2H2 → C6H12. Gives only Z. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Hydrogenation of Y**: C6H12 → C6H12. C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12. Gives only Z. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Z**: C6H12, a hydrocarbon solvent, H% is 14.28%, constituent of Y. **(Checks out)**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
