    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight (MW) of the compound. So, MW = 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32%. The M+ peak at m/z = 156 has a relative abundance of 100%.\n*   **Careful Point:** The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options:\n    *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (C₂H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): MW ≈ 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 156.5 g/mol.\n    All four options are isomers and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, extremely broad absorption that is the hallmark of an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of these two specific peaks (a very broad O-H and a C=O around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: An aldehyde and a phenol. Not a carboxylic acid. Eliminated.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate: An acid chloride/ester derivative. It has no O-H group. Eliminated.\n    *   We are left with B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration for one proton (1H) and its singlet nature (no adjacent protons) confirm this assignment. Both remaining options (B and D) have this proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We have two signals in the aromatic region: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n*   **Careful Point:** The key to distinguishing between the remaining options lies in the symmetry and splitting pattern of the aromatic protons.\n    *   The spectrum shows only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   Each signal is a doublet, meaning each type of proton has only one neighboring proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to 2H, meaning there are two chemically equivalent protons of each type.\n*   **Analysis of Option B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   This is a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons ortho to the -COOH group are equivalent. The two protons ortho to the -Cl group are also equivalent.\n    *   This results in two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the -COOH will be a doublet (split by their one neighbor), and the protons ortho to the -Cl will also be a doublet (split by their one neighbor).\n    *   This predicted pattern (a doublet for 2H and another doublet for 2H) perfectly matches the experimental data. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded (8.02 ppm) than those ortho to the -Cl group (7.72 ppm).\n*   **Analysis of Option D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   There is no symmetry that makes any of the four aromatic protons equivalent. All four are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Therefore, we would expect to see four distinct signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H, with more complex splitting (e.g., doublets, triplets, or doublets of doublets). This is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral data points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular formula, the IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>"
