    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key components of the experiment:**\n    *   **Antigen:** GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus.\n    *   **Route of administration:** Oral gavage, mimicking a natural infection route for gut pathogens.\n    *   **Site of immune response:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The fluorescence confirms the antigen has reached this site.\n    *   **Cells of interest:** A \"proliferating cell population\" isolated from the Peyer's patches. In a secondary lymphoid organ, rapid proliferation of lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) occurs in response to an antigen, typically within structures called germinal centers.\n    *   **Genetic analysis:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene.\" This gene segment codes for the part of the antibody that binds to the antigen.\n    *   **Key observation:** \"High variability\" in the sequenced variable heavy chain gene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the location and timing of the process:**\n    *   The process is occurring in a **secondary lymphoid organ** (Peyer's patch) *after* exposure to an antigen.\n    *   It involves cells that are actively **proliferating**, which is characteristic of an ongoing adaptive immune response.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate and adaptive immune systems involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It does not involve genetic changes in B cells or cause variability in their antibody genes. It is primarily an effector mechanism to clear pathogens.\n\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs specifically in activated B cells that are proliferating within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations at a very high rate into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The purpose is to generate B cell variants with higher affinity for the antigen. This process directly leads to \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" in a \"secondary lymphoid organ.\" This perfectly matches the observations.\n\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, not the *variable* region. This switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG) to change its effector function, but it does not alter the antigen-binding site or contribute to the variability of the variable region.\n\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that creates the initial diversity of B cell and T cell receptors. Crucially, it occurs in **primary lymphoid organs** (bone marrow for B cells) during the development of lymphocytes, *before* they encounter any antigen. The scenario described is happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen encounter. Therefore, VDJ recombination is not the correct process.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells within a Peyer's patch following antigen stimulation is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation. This process is central to affinity maturation, where the immune system refines the quality of the antibody response.\n\n<<<B>>>"
