    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Initial State**\n\n*   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. So, for our two electrons, we have $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   The problem specifies that we are ignoring spin angular momentum.\n*   The system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state, denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m>$. The given state is $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of the total $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and the Final State**\n\n*   A measurement is made on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   The basis for this measurement is the *uncoupled* basis, represented by states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for electron 1 and electron 2, respectively.\n*   We want to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means we must find the system in a state with $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means we must find the system in a state with $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Therefore, the final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n**3. The Core Principle: Relating Coupled and Uncoupled States**\n\n*   The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi_{initial}>$, to be in a final state $|\\psi_{final}>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product: $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2$.\n*   In our case:\n    *   $|\\psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$\n    *   $|\\psi_{final}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$\n*   So, the probability is $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n*   The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n**4. Applying the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Careful Point)**\n\n*   A fundamental rule in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta.\n*   Mathematically, the operator for the total z-component is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n*   This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers: **$m = m_1 + m_2$**.\n*   A Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is non-zero *only if* this condition is met.\n\n**5. Checking the Selection Rule for this Problem**\n\n*   From the initial coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have the total magnetic quantum number **$m = -1$**.\n*   From the desired final uncoupled state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers **$m_1 = -1$** and **$m_2 = -1$**.\n*   Let's calculate the sum for the final state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n*   Now, we compare the total $m$ from the initial state with the sum from the final state:\n    *   $m = -1$\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = -2$\n*   Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\n*   Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient must be zero:\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n*   The probability is the square of this coefficient:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n*   This means it is impossible to start in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ and measure both electrons to have $m_z = -1$. The joint probability is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>"
