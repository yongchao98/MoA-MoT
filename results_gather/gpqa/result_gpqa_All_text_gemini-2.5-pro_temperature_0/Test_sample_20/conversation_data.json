    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand Tautomerism.**\n    Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in dynamic equilibrium and can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound with a carbonyl group (keto form) to exhibit this type of tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen. The presence of an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ hybridized carbon allows for the formation of an enol tautomer.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Benzoquinone.**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are all sp² hybridized as they are part of the ring's double bonds. They do have hydrogen atoms attached, but these are vinylic hydrogens.\n    *   Crucially, for standard keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha-carbon needs to be sp³ hybridized to allow for the formation of a new double bond without disrupting the existing framework in an unstable way. Since benzoquinone lacks sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons with alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can tautomerize to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and thus very stable enol form.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism.**\n    Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Dimethyl fumarate.**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond.\n    *   It does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (located at the midpoint of the C=C bond), which makes it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
