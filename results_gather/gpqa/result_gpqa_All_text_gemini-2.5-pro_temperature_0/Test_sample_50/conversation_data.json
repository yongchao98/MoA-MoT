    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q`.\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n    *   The point charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. We assume `d > R`, meaning the charge is outside the sphere.\n    *   We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Method: The Method of Images**\n    *   This problem involves a charge and a conductor with a simple geometry (a sphere). Such problems are most easily solved using the **method of images**.\n    *   The method of images states that the electric field and potential *outside* the conducting sphere can be perfectly replicated by removing the sphere and placing a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere.\n    *   The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition, which in this case is that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge location: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The image charge is located along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. Since `d > R`, it follows that `b < R`, so the image charge is correctly located *inside* the original sphere's volume. The negative sign of `q'` indicates that the force between the real charge and the sphere is attractive.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy**\n    *   The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n    *   A more direct way to calculate this energy is to consider the interaction energy. The potential energy `U` of a charge `q` in the presence of other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere) is given by:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution on the sphere is itself created by the presence of `q`. As `q` is brought from infinity, the induced charge builds up, and the work done is half of what it would be if the induced charge were a fixed, pre-existing charge distribution.\n    *   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    *   According to the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n\n5.  **Calculate `V_induced`**\n    *   The potential at distance `d` from the center due to the image charge `q'` at distance `b` from the center is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`**\n    *   Now substitute the expression for `V_induced` into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Final Check**\n    *   The result is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   The energy is negative, which is correct for an attractive force.\n    *   The units are correct (`k*q^2/distance`).\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect\n        B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n        C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n        D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n\nThe final answer is derived from a standard application of the method of images and the formula for potential energy in the presence of an induced charge distribution.\n\n<<<C>>>"
