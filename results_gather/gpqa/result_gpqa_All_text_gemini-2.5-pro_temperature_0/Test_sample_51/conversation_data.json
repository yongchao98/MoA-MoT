    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Titanium atoms in two specific energy levels changes. We need to compare the case where the star has no spots to the case where it has spots. This factor can be expressed as:\n    Factor = (Ratio without spots) / (Ratio with spots)\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Law:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the populations ($N_2$, $N_1$) of two energy levels ($E_2$, $E_1$) is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n    $$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT)} $$\n    where:\n    *   $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n    *   $T$ is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Factor Calculation:** Let $R(T)$ be the population ratio $N_2/N_1$ at a given temperature $T$.\n    *   The ratio without spots is $R_{nospots} = R(T_{nospots})$.\n    *   The ratio with spots is $R_{spots} = R(T_{spots})$.\n    *   The factor we need is $F = \\frac{R_{nospots}}{R_{spots}}$.\n    $$ F = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_{nospots})}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_{spots})}} $$\n    The statistical weights ($g_2/g_1$) cancel out, simplifying the expression:\n    $$ F = \\frac{e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_{nospots})}}{e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_{spots})}} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{nospots}} - \\frac{1}{T_{spots}}\\right)} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{spots}} - \\frac{1}{T_{nospots}}\\right)} $$\n\n4.  **Identify the Given Temperatures:**\n    *   The temperature of the photosphere without spots is given as $T_{nospots} = 6000$ K.\n    *   The overall effective temperature of the photosphere when it has spots is given as $T_{spots} = 5500$ K.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The problem provides extra information (star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage) that could be used to calculate the temperature of the dark spots themselves. However, the question refers to the change in the *overall* photospheric effective temperature, implying we should use the given effective temperatures (6000 K and 5500 K) as the characteristic temperatures for the two scenarios. This is a common simplification in such problems.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference ($\\Delta E$):** The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, $\\lambda = 1448$ Å.\n    *   $\\lambda = 1448$ Å = $1448 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n    *   The energy of a photon is $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s) and $c$ is the speed of light ($3 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n    *   $\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{1448 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}} \\approx 1.3728 \\times 10^{-18}$ J.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Exponent:** Now we can calculate the value of the exponent in the formula for the factor $F$. It's often easier to first calculate the term $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{1.3728 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} \\approx 99478$ K.\n    *   Now, calculate the temperature difference term:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{T_{spots}} - \\frac{1}{T_{nospots}} = \\frac{1}{5500 \\text{ K}} - \\frac{1}{6000 \\text{ K}} $$\n    $$ = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66,000} \\text{ K}^{-1} $$\n    *   The full exponent is:\n    $$ \\text{Exponent} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{spots}} - \\frac{1}{T_{nospots}}\\right) = 99478 \\text{ K} \\times \\frac{1}{66,000 \\text{ K}} \\approx 1.507 $$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Factor (F):**\n    *   $F = e^{\\text{Exponent}} = e^{1.507}$\n    *   $F \\approx 4.51$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This matches one of the provided options. The ratio of the populations in the two levels is about 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots (and is hotter) compared to when it has spots (and is cooler overall). This is consistent with the observation that the ratio decreases when spots are present.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n<<<D>>>"
