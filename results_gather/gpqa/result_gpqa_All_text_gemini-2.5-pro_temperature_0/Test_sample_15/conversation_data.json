    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound that is not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features to check for are chiral centers and elements of symmetry (plane of symmetry, center of inversion). If a molecule has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is achiral and thus optically inactive. Compounds with specific stereochemical descriptors (like R or S) are given as single stereoisomers.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: The molecule has a C=C double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond are sp2 hybridized. The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents) in this molecule. The molecule is planar around the double bond. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex, rigid bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The name itself provides the key information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (`3aR,7aS`) and the geometry of a double bond (`E`). This means the name refers to a single, specific stereoisomer. A molecule with chiral centers is chiral unless it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Given the complex and asymmetric substitution pattern, this molecule lacks any such symmetry elements.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the rest of the molecule). This allows for the possibility of a meso compound. The (R,S) combination for this particular structure is indeed the meso form. It possesses an internal plane of symmetry when viewed in the correct conformation (e.g., in its Fischer projection, there is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the (2R,3S) compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The (2R,3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. Together, they form an enantiomeric pair. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with an alcohol group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer is specified. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that all three groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This highly symmetric molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral (a meso-like compound) and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We check for chiral centers. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. No other carbon atom in the molecule is bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
