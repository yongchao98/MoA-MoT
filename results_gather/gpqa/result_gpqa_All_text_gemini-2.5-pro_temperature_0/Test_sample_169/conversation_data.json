    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, `S_y`.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the expectation value, denoted as `<S_y>`, for an electron in a given spin state. The expectation value of an operator represents the average value of the measurement of the corresponding physical quantity.\n\n**2. Define the State and Operator**\n*   **Spin State:** The electron's spin state is given by the unnormalized spinor `|χ>`. In column vector notation, this is:\n    `|χ> = [3i, 4]^T`\n*   **Spin Operator:** The operator for the spin in the y-direction, `S_y`, is related to the Pauli matrix `σ_y` by the formula:\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n    We are given the Pauli matrix `σ_y`:\n    `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n**3. The Formula for Expectation Value**\nFor a quantum state `|ψ>`, the expectation value of an operator `A` is given by `<A> = <ψ|A|ψ>`. If the state is not normalized, the formula is:\n`<A> = <χ|A|χ> / <χ|χ>`\nWe will use this formula with `A = S_y` and the given state `|χ>`.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Find the bra vector `<χ|`**\nThe bra vector `<χ|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector `|χ>`.\n*   `|χ> = [3i, 4]^T`\n*   To find the conjugate transpose, we first take the transpose: `[3i, 4]`.\n*   Then, we take the complex conjugate of each element: `[(3i)*, 4*] = [-3i, 4]`.\n*   So, `<χ| = [-3i, 4]`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the normalization factor `<χ|χ>`**\nThis is the inner product of the state with itself, which will be the denominator in our expectation value formula.\n*   `<χ|χ> = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T`\n*   `<χ|χ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n*   `<χ|χ> = -9i² + 16`\n*   **Careful Point:** Remember that `i² = -1`.\n*   `<χ|χ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the action of the operator on the state, `S_y|χ>`**\nFirst, we apply the operator `S_y` to the ket `|χ>`.\n*   `S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * σ_y * |χ>`\n*   `S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n*   We perform the matrix-vector multiplication:\n    `[[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]^T`\n    `= [ -4i, 3i² ]^T`\n*   **Careful Point:** Again, `i² = -1`.\n    `= [ -4i, -3 ]^T`\n*   So, `S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the full matrix element `<χ|S_y|χ>`**\nThis will be the numerator in our expectation value formula. We multiply the result from Step 3 by the bra vector `<χ|`.\n*   `<χ|S_y|χ> = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T )`\n*   We can pull the constant `ħ/2` to the front:\n    `<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [ -4i, -3 ]^T )`\n*   Now perform the inner product:\n    `(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i² - 12`\n*   **Careful Point:** Using `i² = -1` one last time.\n    `12(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24`.\n*   So, `<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ`.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final expectation value**\nNow we divide the result from Step 4 (the numerator) by the result from Step 2 (the denominator).\n*   `<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n*   `<S_y> = (-12ħ) / 25`\n*   `<S_y> = -12*hbar/25`\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated expectation value is `-12*hbar/25`, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
