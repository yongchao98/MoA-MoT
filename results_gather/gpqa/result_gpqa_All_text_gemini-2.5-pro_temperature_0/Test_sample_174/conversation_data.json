    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Model the Radiating Source**\nThe problem describes an oscillating charge distribution that is spheroid in shape with a symmetry axis along the z-axis. For radiation observed in the far-field (the radiation zone), and assuming the wavelength `λ` is much larger than the size of the spheroid, this system can be accurately approximated as an oscillating electric dipole. The oscillation of charge along the symmetry axis (z-axis) creates an electric dipole moment `p(t)` that oscillates along the z-axis.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Angular Dependence of the Radiated Power**\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) from an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the polar angle measured from the z-axis, and `K` is a factor that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment, the frequency of oscillation, and fundamental constants, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The power is not radiated uniformly in all directions. It depends on the angle `θ`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Maximum Radiated Power (A)**\nThe maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, occurs when the `sin²(θ)` term is at its maximum.\n*   The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n*   Therefore, the maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is `1² = 1`.\n*   So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K`.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The maximum radiation is perpendicular to the axis of oscillation, not along it. In fact, the radiation is zero along the axis (`θ = 0°` or `180°`).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Power at θ = 30°**\nWe need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. Using the same formula:\n`dP/dΩ (at 30°) = K * sin²(30°)`\n*   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n*   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n*   So, `dP/dΩ (at 30°) = K * (1/4)`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Fraction of A**\nThe question asks for the fraction of `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°`. This is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power `A`.\nFraction = `[dP/dΩ (at 30°)] / A`\nFraction = `(K * 1/4) / K`\nFraction = `1/4`\n\nThis result eliminates options B and D. We are left with A and C.\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the Wavelength Dependence of the Radiated Power**\nThe function `f(λ, θ)` represents the radiated power per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`. The full formula for `dP/dΩ` for an electric dipole `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt)` is:\n`dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² c) * sin²(θ)`\nHere, the power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency, `ω⁴`.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The power radiated by a dipole is very strongly dependent on frequency (`∝ ω⁴`).\n\nWe need to find the dependence on wavelength `λ`. The angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` are related by the speed of light `c`:\n`ω = 2πf` and `c = fλ`, which gives `ω = 2πc / λ`.\n\nNow, substitute this into the proportionality:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (2πc / λ)⁴`\nSince `2πc` is a constant, we have:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ 1/λ⁴` or `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis means the function `f(λ, θ)` has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence. This is the famous dependence found in Rayleigh scattering, which is itself a form of dipole radiation.\n\n**Step 7: Conclude the Final Answer**\n*   From Step 5, the fraction of the maximum power at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n*   From Step 6, the dependence of the radiated power on wavelength is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nCombining these two findings, the correct choice is the one that has both `1/4` and `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
