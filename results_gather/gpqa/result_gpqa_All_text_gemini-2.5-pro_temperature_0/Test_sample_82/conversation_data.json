    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume (V₂) = Initial volume of acid + Volume of water = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final concentration of acetic acid (M₂) = ?\n\nM₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid solution we are titrating is **0.025 M**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This means 75% of the acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   At this point, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n    [A⁻] / [HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), in water. The acetate ion will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **a. Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    *   Moles of acetic acid = M_acid × V_acid = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.00100 mol\n    *   Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of NaOH needed = 0.00100 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 mL (or 10.00 cm³).\n\n*   **b. Find the concentration of acetate at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total volume of solution = Initial acid volume + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Moles of acetate formed = Initial moles of acetic acid = 0.00100 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.0200 M.\n\n*   **c. Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate.**\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate. We can find it from Ka and Kw (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻] at equilibrium:\n|             | CH₃COO⁻ | H₂O | ⇌ | CH₃COOH | OH⁻   |\n|-------------|---------|-----|---|-----------|-------|\n| Initial (I) | 0.0200  | -   |   | 0         | 0     |\n| Change (C)  | -x      | -   |   | +x        | +x    |\n| Equil. (E)  | 0.0200-x| -   |   | x         | x     |\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.0200 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.0200. So, 0.0200 - x ≈ 0.0200.\n        5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.0200\n        x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.0200 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Now, calculate pOH:\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   Finally, calculate pH:\n        pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH values are:\n*   At 25% titration: **4.26**\n*   At the equivalence point: **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
