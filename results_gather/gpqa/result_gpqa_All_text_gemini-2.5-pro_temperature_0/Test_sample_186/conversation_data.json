    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Detection Criterion\n\nThe problem states that a star is detectable if the ESPRESSO spectrograph, coupled with a single 8m VLT telescope (1-UT mode), can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel in a 1-hour (3600 seconds) exposure.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Limiting Apparent Magnitude (V)\n\nTo find out which stars are detectable, we need to determine the faintest apparent magnitude (V) that meets the S/N criterion. We will refer to the official documentation for ESPRESSO's performance.\n\n1.  **Consult ESPRESSO Performance Data:** The ESPRESSO User Manual provides a table with the expected S/N for a G2V star observed for 1 hour in 1-UT mode under typical conditions (0.8\" seeing, 1.2 airmass). The S/N is given \"per resolution element,\" which is equivalent to \"per binned pixel\" in the context of an extracted spectrum.\n2.  **Select the Appropriate Mode:** ESPRESSO has several resolution modes (Medium, High, Ultra-High). The question asks if a star is \"detectable,\" implying we should consider the mode that allows for the detection of the faintest objects. Lower resolution modes have higher throughput, meaning they collect more light per pixel and are better for observing faint targets.\n3.  **Find the Limiting Magnitude:** According to the performance table in the ESPRESSO User Manual, the Medium Resolution mode (MR, R≈70,000) achieves the following:\n    *   For a star with V = 12 mag, S/N ≈ 47.\n    *   For a star with V = 15 mag, S/N ≈ 10.\n    *   For a star with V = 16 mag, S/N ≈ 6.\n\n    Therefore, in its Medium Resolution mode, ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N of 10 for a star with an apparent magnitude of V = 15 in a 1-hour exposure. Our detection criterion is thus: **The star must have an apparent magnitude V ≤ 15.**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Star\n\nFor each star, we must check two conditions:\n1.  **Observability:** Can the star be seen from the Paranal Observatory in Chile (Latitude ≈ -24.6° S)? A star is observable if its declination (DEC) is within the range that rises above the horizon, which for Paranal is approximately DEC < +65.4°.\n2.  **Brightness:** Is the star's apparent V magnitude ≤ 15?\n\n---\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Observability:** The declination of Canopus is approximately -52° 41'. This is well within the observable range from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude of Canopus is -0.74.\n*   **Conclusion:** -0.74 is much less than 15. **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Observability:** The declination of Polaris is approximately +89° 15'. This is far north of the visibility limit (+65.4°) for Paranal. Polaris is a northern circumpolar star and is never visible from the VLT.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Polaris is not detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (Mv) = 15, distance (d) = 10 pc**\n*   **Observability:** The declination is 0°, which is on the celestial equator and is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude (m) using the distance modulus formula: m = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5.\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * (1) - 5\n    *   m = 15\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V = 15. Since 15 ≤ 15, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Mv = 15, d = 200 pc**\n*   **Observability:** The declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.301) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V ≈ 21.5. Since 21.5 > 15, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Mv = 15, d = 5 pc**\n*   **Observability:** The declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V ≈ 13.5. Since 13.5 ≤ 15, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Mv = 15, d = 50 pc**\n*   **Observability:** The declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.699) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5\n*   **Conclusion:** The apparent magnitude is V ≈ 18.5. Since 18.5 > 15, **this star is not detectable.**\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nLet's summarize the results:\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: **Not Detectable** (not visible)\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Detectable**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **Not Detectable** (too faint)\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Detectable**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **Not Detectable** (too faint)\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
