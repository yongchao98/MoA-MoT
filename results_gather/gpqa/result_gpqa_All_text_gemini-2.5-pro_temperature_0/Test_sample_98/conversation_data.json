    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. This peak often overlaps with the C-H stretching peaks which also appear in this region (around 2850-3000 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. For a saturated carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The presence of both a broad O-H stretch and a strong C=O stretch strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This tells us that the compound does not contain any C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This is a very complex splitting pattern and provides a significant clue. For a proton to exhibit this splitting, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (n+1 = 2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet (n+1 = 4).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This is another complex pattern. A proton showing this splitting must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (n+1 = 2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n    *   A second, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into another **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure against the NMR Data**\n\nWe need to find a structure that contains one proton in an environment that would produce a `dtq` and another proton in an environment that would produce a `dtt`. We will analyze the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`HOOC-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH₃(e)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, gives a triplet), and the adjacent CH₃ group (3H, gives a quartet). This would result in a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₃ group on the same carbon (3H, gives a quartet), and the terminal CH₃(e) group (3H, gives a quartet). This would result in a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq). This does not match the `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\nLet's determine the structure from the formula, assuming the longest chain containing the COOH group is the parent chain: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n*   **Proton H(4) (on C4):** It is coupled to H(3) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₃ group on C4 (3H, gives a quartet), and the CH₂ group at C5 (2H, gives a triplet). This would result in a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(3) (on C3):** It is coupled to H(4) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, gives a triplet). This would result in a **dtt**. This matches the second signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure B has protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt`. This is a perfect match.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`HOOC-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂(b)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₃ group on C3 (3H, gives a quartet). This would result in a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, gives a doublet) and the CH₃ group on C2 (3H, gives a quartet). This would result in a doublet of quartets (dq). This does not match the `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid)**\n`HOOC-CH(d)(C₂H₅)-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(b)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, gives a triplet). This would result in a **dtt**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, gives a doublet) and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C2 (2H, gives a triplet). This would result in a doublet of triplets (dt). This does not match the `dtq` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure B, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, has the specific arrangement of protons required to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
