    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**Step 1: Define the State and the Non-Gaussianity Measure**\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\nwhere `N` is the normalization constant: `N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2))`.\n\nThe non-Gaussianity (nG) is measured by the relative entropy between the state's density matrix `rho` and a reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`nG = del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau))`\nThis can be rewritten in terms of von Neumann entropy `S(rho) = -trace(rho * ln(rho))`:\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n**Step 2: Specialize the State with Given Parameters**\n\nWe are given the parameters:\n*   `phi = -pi / 4`\n*   `alpha = 0.5`\n\nLet's substitute `phi = -pi / 4` into the state definition:\n*   `cos(-pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(-pi/4) = -1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1`\n\nThe state becomes:\n`|psi> = ( (1/sqrt(2))|alpha> - (1/sqrt(2))|-alpha> ) / sqrt(1 - exp(-2*alpha^2))`\n`|psi> = (|alpha> - |-alpha>) / sqrt(2 * (1 - exp(-2*alpha^2)))`\n\nThis is a pure quantum state. The density matrix is `rho = |psi><psi|`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Entropy of the State `rho`**\n\nThe von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero.\nFor a pure state `rho = |psi><psi|`, its eigenvalues are {1, 0, 0, ...}. The entropy is calculated as `S = -sum(p_i * ln(p_i))`.\n`S(rho) = -(1 * ln(1) + 0 * ln(0) + ...) = 0`.\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity simplifies to:\n`nG = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau)`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as `rho`. A Gaussian state is fully defined by its mean displacement vector and its covariance matrix.\n\n*   **First Moments (Mean Displacement):**\n    We need to calculate `<a>_rho = <psi|a|psi>`. Due to the symmetry of the state (it's an odd state), the mean displacement is zero.\n    `<a>_rho = 0`.\n    Therefore, the reference state `tau` is also a centered Gaussian state, which is a squeezed thermal state.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix):**\n    We need to calculate `<a^2>_rho` and the mean photon number `<n>_rho = <a_dagger * a>_rho`.\n    1.  `<a^2>_rho = <psi|a^2|psi>`. Since `a^2|psi> = alpha^2|psi>`, we have `<a^2>_rho = alpha^2`.\n    2.  `<n>_rho = <psi|a_dagger * a|psi>`. The calculation for this state yields `<n>_rho = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`.\n\nThe reference state `tau` must match these moments:\n*   `<a>_tau = 0`\n*   `<a^2>_tau = alpha^2`\n*   `<n>_tau = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n\n**Step 5: Find the Parameters of the Reference State `tau`**\n\nA centered squeezed thermal state `tau` is characterized by a squeezing parameter `r` and a thermal photon number `n_th`. Its moments are:\n*   `<a^2>_tau = (n_th + 1/2) * sinh(2r)`\n*   `<n>_tau = n_th * cosh(2r) + sinh^2(r) = (n_th + 1/2) * cosh(2r) - 1/2`\n\nBy equating the moments of `rho` and `tau`, we get a system of two equations:\n1.  `alpha^2 = (n_th + 1/2) * sinh(2r)`\n2.  `alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2) = (n_th + 1/2) * cosh(2r) - 1/2`\n\nWe can solve this system for `n_th` and `r`. Dividing the second equation by the first gives:\n`coth(2r) = coth(alpha^2) + 1 / (2*alpha^2)`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Thermal Photon Number `n_th`**\n\nNow, we plug in the value `alpha = 0.5`, which means `alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n`coth(2r) = coth(0.25) + 1 / (2 * 0.25) = coth(0.25) + 2`\n\nLet's evaluate `coth(0.25)`:\n`coth(0.25) = (e^(2*0.25) + 1) / (e^(2*0.25) - 1) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1)`\n`e^0.5 = sqrt(e) ≈ 1.6487`\n`coth(0.25) ≈ (1.6487 + 1) / (1.6487 - 1) = 2.6487 / 0.6487 ≈ 4.083`\n\nSo, `coth(2r) ≈ 4.083 + 2 = 6.083`.\n\nNow we find `sinh(2r)`:\n`sinh^2(2r) = 1 / (coth^2(2r) - 1) ≈ 1 / (6.083^2 - 1) = 1 / (37.0 - 1) = 1/36`\n`sinh(2r) ≈ 1/6`\n\nNow we can find `n_th` using the first equation of our system:\n`alpha^2 = (n_th + 1/2) * sinh(2r)`\n`0.25 = (n_th + 1/2) * (1/6)`\n`n_th + 1/2 = 0.25 * 6 = 1.5`\n`n_th = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1`\n\nThe parameters were chosen such that the thermal photon number of the reference state is exactly 1.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Final Non-Gaussianity**\n\nThe non-Gaussianity is `nG = S(tau)`. The entropy of a squeezed thermal state is the same as the entropy of the original thermal state it was created from.\n`S(tau) = S(rho_th(n_th)) = (n_th + 1)ln(n_th + 1) - n_th*ln(n_th)`\n\nSubstitute `n_th = 1`:\n`nG = (1 + 1)ln(1 + 1) - 1*ln(1)`\n`nG = 2*ln(2) - 0`\n`nG = 2 * 0.6931... = 1.3862...`\n\nThis value is approximately 1.38.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.38\nB) 2.48\nC) 0\nD) 0.25\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
