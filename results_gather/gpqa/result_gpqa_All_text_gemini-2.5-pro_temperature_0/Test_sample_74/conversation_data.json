    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Experimental Setup**\nThe primary goal is to express a recombinant GADD45G protein in cells. This protein is designed for a specific purpose: to be affinity-purified to find its binding partners. To achieve this, the GADD45G coding sequence is modified to include an N-terminal tag, specifically the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The experiment involves transfecting a plasmid containing this construct into CHO cells.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Problem**\nThe experiment fails. The expected recombinant protein is not being overexpressed. The key piece of information provided to diagnose the problem is the DNA sequence of the construct's plus strand.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence**\nThe sequence is:\n5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGC...TGA 3'\n\nTo understand what protein this sequence would produce, we need to perform a conceptual translation, starting from the beginning of the sequence. Translation in eukaryotes almost always starts at the first ATG codon.\n\n*   **Find the Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `ATG`. This is the start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). This will be the first amino acid of the protein.\n\n*   **Identify the HA Tag:** The problem states that an N-terminal HA tag was added. The amino acid sequence for the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's see if the DNA sequence codes for this tag after the start codon.\n    *   `ATG` -> Met (M)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    The sequence `ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC` correctly codes for the peptide M-YPYDVPDYA. This confirms the start of the sequence and the HA tag are correctly encoded.\n\n*   **Continue Translating the Sequence:** Now, we must examine the sequence immediately following the HA tag to see if it corresponds to the GADD45G protein.\n    *   The sequence continues with `AAA`. `AAA` codes for the amino acid Lysine (K).\n    *   The next codon is `TGA`.\n\n*   **Identify the Anomaly:** The codon `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon in the mRNA (`UGA` in this case), it does not incorporate an amino acid. Instead, release factors bind to the ribosome, causing the termination of translation and the release of the newly synthesized polypeptide chain.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Consequences of the Anomaly**\nThe presence of a `TGA` stop codon immediately after the sequence for the HA tag (and one additional lysine) means that translation will stop prematurely. The ribosome will synthesize a very short peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K) and then fall off the mRNA. The full-length GADD45G protein will never be synthesized. This directly explains the experimental observation that the protein is not being overexpressed.\n\n**Step 5: Assess the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is biologically correct (stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs), but it is irrelevant to the specific problem. The stop codon found in the sequence is `TGA` (which would be `UGA` in mRNA), not `TAA` (`UAA` in mRNA). More importantly, the issue is the *presence* of a premature stop codon in the coding sequence, not the general mechanism of translation termination.\n\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** A missense mutation would change one amino acid for another. As analyzed in Step 3, the DNA sequence for the HA tag is correct and codes for the intended YPYDVPDYA peptide. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** A linker is often used but is not always essential. Its absence might cause misfolding, which could lead to degradation (proteolysis). However, the problem identified in the sequence (the premature stop codon) is a primary synthesis error. The full-length protein is not even being made, so it cannot be degraded. This option describes a potential secondary problem, but the primary, definitive cause is the premature termination.\n\n*   **D) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This option accurately describes the consequence of the premature `TGA` stop codon found in the sequence. The ribosome initiates translation correctly but stops long before it can translate the GADD45G portion of the construct. This is the direct cause of the failure to produce the full-length protein.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe most accurate explanation for the lack of protein expression is the presence of a premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the engineered DNA sequence, which causes the ribosome to terminate translation early.\n\n<<<D>>>"
