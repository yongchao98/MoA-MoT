    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Careful Points & Conditions**\n\n1.  **Observatory Locations and Visibility:**\n    *   The Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO) is in the Southern Hemisphere in Chile, at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. A star is visible if its declination (DEC) is less than `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`.\n    *   The W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES) is in the Northern Hemisphere in Hawaii, at a latitude of approximately +19.8°. A star is visible if its declination (DEC) is greater than `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n    *   **Combined Condition 1 (Visibility):** For a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination must be within the range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n2.  **Instrument Magnitude Limits:**\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V_app) brighter than 17.0 mag (`V_app < 17.0`).\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16.0 mag (`V_app < 16.0`).\n    *   **Combined Condition 2 (Brightness):** For a star to be detected by both instruments, it must satisfy the stricter limit. Therefore, its apparent V magnitude must be **`V_app < 16.0`**.\n\n3.  **Calculating Apparent Magnitude:**\n    *   If the absolute magnitude (M_V) is given, the apparent magnitude (V_app) must be calculated using the distance modulus formula, including extinction (A_V).\n    *   Formula: `V_app = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n    *   Where `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc) and `A_V` is the extinction in the V-band.\n    *   Extinction is calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`, as stated in the problem.\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Star**\n\n**Star 1**\n*   DEC = -75°\n*   **Visibility Check:** The declination of -75° is outside the required range of -70.2° < DEC < +65.4°. It is too far south to be observed from the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 1 cannot be detected by both observatories.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   DEC = +55°\n*   V_app = 16.5 mag\n*   **Visibility Check:** The declination of +55° is within the required range.\n*   **Brightness Check:** The apparent magnitude is 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than the HIRES limit of 16.0 mag (`16.5 > 16.0`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 2 cannot be detected by both observatories because it is too faint for HIRES.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   DEC = +48°\n*   V_app = 15.5 mag\n*   **Visibility Check:** The declination of +48° is within the required range.\n*   **Brightness Check:** The apparent magnitude is 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the combined limit of 16.0 mag (`15.5 < 16.0`). (Note: The apparent magnitude is the observed brightness, which already accounts for any extinction. The extra information about E(B-V) is not needed to check the brightness condition).\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 3 **can** be detected by both observatories.\n\n**Star 4**\n*   DEC = -48°\n*   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n*   **Visibility Check:** The declination of -48° is within the required range.\n*   **Brightness Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    1.  Calculate extinction: `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n    2.  Calculate apparent magnitude: `V_app = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n        `V_app = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24`\n        `V_app = 15.5 + 5 * (1) - 5 + 1.24`\n        `V_app = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n    3.  Compare with the limit: `16.74 > 16.0`. The star is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 4 cannot be detected by both observatories.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   DEC = +60°\n*   M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc\n*   **Visibility Check:** The declination of +60° is within the required range.\n*   **Brightness Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude (assuming no extinction, as none is given).\n    1.  `A_V = 0`.\n    2.  Calculate apparent magnitude: `V_app = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n        `V_app = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0`\n        `V_app = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5`\n        `V_app = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995` mag.\n    3.  Compare with the limit: `14.995 < 16.0`. The star is bright enough for both instruments.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 5 **can** be detected by both observatories.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, Star 3 and Star 5 are the only stars that meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<B>>>"
