    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Decay Process and Conservation Laws**\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$). The reaction is:\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\nSince the pion is initially at rest, this decay must obey two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Assumptions**\n*   Initial particle: Pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Rest mass energy of muon ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV.\n*   **Assumption:** The neutrino ($\\nu$) is considered massless. Its rest mass energy ($m_{\\nu}c^2$) is 0. This is a standard and valid approximation for this type of problem.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n*   **Initial Momentum:** Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum ($p_{\\pi}$) is zero.\n*   **Final Momentum:** After the decay, the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Let their momenta be $\\vec{p}_{\\mu}$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n*   **Equation:**\n    $p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n    $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    This implies that their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total energy of the stationary pion is just its rest mass energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$). We must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (0)^2} = p_{\\nu}c$\n*   **Equation:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    Substituting the expressions for energy and using $p_{\\mu}c = p_{\\nu}c = pc$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**5. Solve for the Momentum (pc)**\nWe need to solve the energy conservation equation for the momentum magnitude `p` (or more conveniently, `pc`).\n1.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the square root term:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n2.  Square both sides of the equation:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}\\right)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n3.  The $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n4.  Solve for `pc`:\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Value of pc**\nSubstitute the given rest mass energies:\n*   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n*   $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n$pc = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n$pc = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2}$\n$pc \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n\n**7. Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\nThe kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy ($KE = E - mc^2$).\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its rest energy is zero. Its total energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 = pc - 0 = pc$\n    $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n    Rounding to one decimal place gives **29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    We can find this using the total energy released in the decay (the Q-value). The initial mass energy is converted into the final rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy of the products.\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 4.12$ MeV\n\n**8. Final Answer**\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$) = **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$) = **29.8 MeV**\n\nThis pair of values matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
