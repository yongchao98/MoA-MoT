    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-), a good nucleophile, attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom (a good leaving group).\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving alkylation and cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) groups. These protons are particularly acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization (Thorpe-Ziegler reaction):** The problem states \"excess sodium hydride\". This means there is enough base to deprotonate the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of the intermediate formed above.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n        The resulting carbanion is now positioned to attack the other end of the pentane chain, which still has a bromine atom. This intramolecular SN2 reaction is highly favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    4.  **Final Product 4:** The product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry and Conformation:** Cyclohexane rings exist in rapidly interconverting chair conformations at room temperature. However, for the purpose of counting chemically distinct protons in complex substituted rings, it is a common convention in academic problems to consider a single, \"locked\" or \"frozen\" chair conformation. In this state, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry and is chiral.\n*   **Counting the Signals (assuming a locked conformation):**\n    1.  **Ring Protons:** In a locked, unsymmetrical cyclohexane derivative, all the methylene groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically different environments. Furthermore, the two protons on each methylene group (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n        *   Protons on C2: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C3: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C4: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C5: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C6: 2 distinct signals.\n        This gives a total of **10 distinct signals** from the protons on the cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Ethoxycarbonyl Group Protons (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-O-CH2-):** In many introductory contexts, the two protons of the ethyl's methylene group are treated as equivalent, giving one signal (a quartet). Although they are technically diastereotopic in a chiral molecule (like our locked conformation) and should give two signals, it is a frequent simplification in problems of this type to count them as one.\n        *   Assuming this common simplification, the methylene protons give **1 signal**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ring: 10 signals\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH2-) + 1 (for -CH3-) = 2 signals\n    *   Total = 10 + 2 = **12 signals**.\n\nThis number matches one of the given options. The alternative analysis (assuming rapid chair flipping) leads to 7 signals, which is not an option. The alternative reaction product (a dimer) leads to a mixture of diastereomers, making the analysis inconsistent with a single number answer. Therefore, the most plausible intended answer is derived from the analysis of the major cyclized product under the assumption of a locked conformation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
