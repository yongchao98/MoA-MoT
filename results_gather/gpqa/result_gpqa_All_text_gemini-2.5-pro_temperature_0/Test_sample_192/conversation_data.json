    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between Parallax and Distance.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is the apparent shift in the position of a nearby star against the background of distant objects as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to the star. The standard formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    where `plx` is in arcseconds and `r` is in parsecs. For our purposes, the key relationship is the proportionality:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Interpret the given information.**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". This typically refers to the cumulative number of stars observed with a parallax *greater than* a certain value, `plx`. Let's denote this cumulative number as `N`.\n    So, we are given:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of distance.**\n    Since we want to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`, we need to substitute the relationship from Step 1 into the expression from Step 2.\n    We know `plx ∝ 1/r`. Let's substitute this into the given relation:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This expression, `N ∝ r^5`, represents the *total* (or cumulative) number of stars within a sphere of radius `r`.\n\n4.  **Determine what the question is asking for.**\n    The question asks \"How does the number of stars ... change with distance (*per unit range of distance, r*)?\". This is not asking for the total number of stars up to a distance `r` (which is `N`). Instead, it's asking for the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r` with a small thickness `dr`. This quantity is the rate of change of the total number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the number of stars per unit range of distance.**\n    We have the relationship for the total number of stars up to distance `r`:\n    `N(r) = k * r^5` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality)\n    To find the number of stars per unit range of distance, we need to differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`), we get:\n    `dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5k * r^4`\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Parallax vs. Distance:** It is crucial to remember the inverse relationship `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n*   **Cumulative Number vs. Number Density:** The most common mistake is to confuse the *total* number of stars up to a distance `r` (`N(r)`) with the number of stars *per unit distance* at `r` (`dN/dr`). The problem gives a relationship for the former (`N`) and asks for the latter (`dN/dr`).\n*   **Calculus:** The final step requires differentiation to go from the cumulative number `N(r)` to the number per unit distance `dN/dr`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r^4`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
