    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the conditions for transit and occultation.**\n*   A **transit** occurs when a planet passes in front of its star as seen by an observer. For a transit to happen, the projected distance of the planet's center from the star's center must be less than the sum of their radii ($R_s + R_p$).\n*   An **occultation** (or secondary eclipse) occurs when the planet passes behind its star. For an occultation to happen, the projected distance of the planet's center from the star's center must be less than the star's radius ($R_s$).\n*   For **both** events to occur, the more restrictive condition must be met. Therefore, the projected distance of the planet's center from the star's center must be less than or equal to the star's radius.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the geometric condition mathematically.**\n*   The projected distance of a planet's center from its star's center at the point of closest approach (conjunction) is given by $d_{proj} = a \\cos(i)$, where *a* is the semi-major axis of the orbit and *i* is the orbital inclination (where $i=90^\\circ$ is a perfectly edge-on orbit).\n*   The condition for both transit and occultation for the second planet (Planet 2) is therefore:\n    $a_2 \\cos(i) \\le R_s$\n*   To find the *maximum* orbital period, we need to find the *maximum* possible semi-major axis ($a_{2,max}$), which occurs at the limit of this condition:\n    $a_{2,max} \\cos(i) = R_s$  (Equation 1)\n\n**Step 3: Use the information from the first planet to find the system's inclination.**\n*   The problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane, which means they have the same inclination, *i*.\n*   The transit impact parameter, *b*, is defined as the projected distance at mid-transit, normalized by the stellar radius:\n    $b = \\frac{a \\cos(i)}{R_s}$\n*   For the first planet (Planet 1), we are given $b_1 = 0.2$. So:\n    $0.2 = \\frac{a_1 \\cos(i)}{R_s}$\n*   We can rearrange this to find an expression for the geometric term $a_1 \\cos(i)$:\n    $a_1 \\cos(i) = 0.2 \\cdot R_s$ (Equation 2)\n\n**Step 4: Relate the semi-major axes of the two planets.**\n*   We now have two equations involving the common inclination *i* and stellar radius $R_s$. We can find the relationship between $a_1$ and $a_{2,max}$ by dividing Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n    $\\frac{a_{2,max} \\cos(i)}{a_1 \\cos(i)} = \\frac{R_s}{0.2 \\cdot R_s}$\n*   The terms $\\cos(i)$ and $R_s$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{a_{2,max}}{a_1} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5$\n*   This means the maximum semi-major axis for Planet 2 is 5 times the semi-major axis of Planet 1:\n    $a_{2,max} = 5 \\cdot a_1$\n\n**Careful Point:** Note that the radii of the planets and the absolute radius of the star were not needed to find this ratio. They are extraneous information for this specific question.\n\n**Step 5: Use Kepler's Third Law to find the maximum period for Planet 2.**\n*   Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (*P*) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (*a*): $P^2 \\propto a^3$.\n*   We can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n    $(\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^2 = (\\frac{a_2}{a_1})^3$\n*   Solving for $P_2$:\n    $P_2 = P_1 \\cdot (\\frac{a_2}{a_1})^{3/2}$\n*   Now, we substitute the maximum values and the relationship we found in Step 4:\n    $P_{2,max} = P_1 \\cdot (\\frac{a_{2,max}}{a_1})^{3/2} = P_1 \\cdot (\\frac{5 \\cdot a_1}{a_1})^{3/2}$\n    $P_{2,max} = P_1 \\cdot (5)^{3/2}$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   We are given $P_1 = 3$ days.\n*   $P_{2,max} = 3 \\cdot (5)^{1.5}$\n*   $5^{1.5} = \\sqrt{5^3} = \\sqrt{125} = \\sqrt{25 \\cdot 5} = 5\\sqrt{5}$\n*   $P_{2,max} = 3 \\cdot 5\\sqrt{5} = 15\\sqrt{5}$\n*   Using the approximation $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$:\n*   $P_{2,max} \\approx 15 \\cdot 2.236 = 33.54$ days.\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
