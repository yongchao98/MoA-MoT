    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Key Information**\nThe goal is to determine the functional relationship between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in disease resistance in white lupine. We are given phenotype data (resistance levels) for single and double knockout mutants. A crucial piece of information is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor (TF) that regulates one or more of the other genes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Phenotypes of Single Mutants**\nWe compare the resistance of each single mutant to the wild-type (control) which has 100% resistance.\n*   **Wild-Type (WT): 100% resistance.** This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant: 75% resistance.** The loss of G1 function causes a 25% reduction in resistance. This means G1 plays a role, but it's not the most critical of the three.\n*   **g3 mutant: 50% resistance.** The loss of G3 function causes a 50% reduction in resistance. G3 is more important for resistance than G1.\n*   **g2 mutant: 0% resistance.** The loss of G2 function completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 is absolutely essential for the resistance pathway.\n\nFrom the single mutants, we can establish a hierarchy of importance for resistance: **G2 > G3 > G1**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Phenotypes of Double Mutants to Determine Genetic Interactions (Epistasis)**\nEpistasis occurs when the phenotype of a double mutant is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants, meaning one gene's effect masks the other's.\n*   **g1g2 double mutant: 0% resistance.** This is the same phenotype as the g2 single mutant (0% resistance). The effect of the g1 mutation (a drop to 75%) is not seen in the presence of the g2 mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant: 0% resistance.** This is the same phenotype as the g2 single mutant (0% resistance). The effect of the g3 mutation (a drop to 50%) is not seen in the presence of the g2 mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n*   **g1g3 double mutant: 10% resistance.** This phenotype is different from both the g1 single mutant (75%) and the g3 single mutant (50%). It is also much more severe than would be expected if their effects were simply additive (a 25% loss + 50% loss = 75% total loss, for 25% remaining resistance). This strong, non-additive effect is called **synergistic epistasis**, often suggesting the genes function in parallel pathways or have partially redundant functions. There is no simple epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a Hypothesis about the Pathway**\nWe know one gene is a TF acting upstream. In a genetic pathway, a gene that is epistatic to others and has the most severe phenotype when knocked out is the best candidate for an upstream regulator (like a TF) or a critical downstream component.\n*   The data shows G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and the g2 mutant has the most severe phenotype (0% resistance).\n*   This strongly suggests that G2 is an upstream transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3 (Pathway: G2 -> G1 and G2 -> G3). When G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can function, leading to a total loss of resistance. This model is consistent with all the data.\n*   Conversely, it's highly unlikely that G1 or G3 are the primary TFs, because their knockouts have weaker effects than the g2 knockout.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options Based on the Analysis**\nLet's check each option against our conclusions.\n*   **Our conclusions:** G2 is the likely TF. G2 is epistatic to G1. G2 is epistatic to G3. G1 and G3 interact synergistically (no simple epistasis between them).\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": This contradicts our analysis. G2 is the most likely TF.\n    *   \"G2 and G3 show pleiotropy\": We cannot determine this from the data, as we are only measuring one trait (resistance).\n    *   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\": This is a **correct** statement, as derived directly from the g1g2 data.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is consistent with our analysis.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": This is **incorrect**. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is consistent with our analysis.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": This is a plausible interpretation of their synergistic interaction.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This is **incorrect**. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is consistent with our analysis.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This is **incorrect**.\n\n**Step 6: Final Decision**\nWe have a conflict. Options B, C, and D correctly identify the most likely TF (G2) but make incorrect statements about the relationship between G1 and G3. Option A incorrectly identifies the TF but contains a statement about epistasis (\"G2 is epistatic towards G1\") that is a direct, undeniable conclusion from the experimental data. In multiple-choice questions with potential flaws, the best strategy is often to select the option that contains the most certain and verifiable conclusion. The epistasis of G2 over G1 is a direct observation, while the identity of the TF is a hypothesis (albeit a very strong one). Since A is the only option that contains a correct statement of epistasis, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
