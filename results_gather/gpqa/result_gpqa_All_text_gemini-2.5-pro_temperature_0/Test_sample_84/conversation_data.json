    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Identify Key Formulas\nThe primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nThe formula for the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the semi-major axis 'a' for each planet. This can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) by:\nK = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\nwhere:\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\nwhere v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a).\nCombining these gives:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a))\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Assumptions\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** Since both planets orbit the same star (same T_star and R_star) and have the same albedo (A), these terms will cancel out when we take the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.\n*   **Orbital Inclination (i):** The problem states that the planets were detected using *both* the transit and RV methods. A transit can only be observed if the orbit is nearly edge-on to our line of sight (inclination i ≈ 90°). Therefore, it is a safe assumption that sin(i) ≈ 1 for both planets.\n*   **Planet Mass vs. Star Mass:** The masses of the planets (7 and 5 Earth masses) are negligible compared to the star's mass (1.5 Solar masses). This justifies the approximations used in the RV formulas.\n*   **Unnecessary Information:** The absolute values of the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed to calculate the final ratio. They are provided for context but will cancel out in the derivation.\n\n### Step 3: Derive the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\n1.  **Formulate the temperature ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a1))] / [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a2))]\n    Simplifying this by canceling common terms gives:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n2.  **Relate the semi-major axis 'a' to the given parameters:**\n    From the RV amplitude formula, K ≈ (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a)) (assuming sin(i)=1).\n    Let's rearrange to solve for 'a':\n    sqrt(a) ≈ (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (K * sqrt(M_star))\n    a ≈ G * M_p^2 / (K^2 * M_star)\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = [G * M_p2^2 / (K2^2 * M_star)] / [G * M_p1^2 / (K1^2 * M_star)]\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n4.  **Relate the RV amplitude ratio (K1/K2) to the Doppler shift ratio (Δλ1/Δλ2):**\n    K1 = c * (Δλ1 / λ_0)\n    K2 = c * (Δλ2 / λ_0)\n    K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ2 / λ_0) = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\n5.  **Substitute this back into the expression for a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2\n\n6.  **Finally, substitute this into the temperature ratio expression:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2 )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
