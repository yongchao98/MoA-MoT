    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physics Concept**\n\nThe problem involves the phenomenon of **time dilation**, a key prediction of Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity. Time dilation means that time passes at different rates for observers in different reference frames, especially when one is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to the other.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** This is the time measured by the observer in the moving reference frame (the astronaut on the spacecraft). This is the time we need to find.\n*   **Observer's Time (Δt):** This is the time measured by a stationary observer (e.g., on Earth or in the Large Magellanic Cloud).\n\n**2. Identify the Given and Required Information**\n\n*   **Speed of the spacecraft (v):** 0.99999987 * c, where c is the speed of light.\n*   **Distance of the journey (d):** The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. This is a piece of astronomical data we need to look up. A commonly accepted value is approximately **160,000 light-years**.\n*   **Astronaut's initial age:** 22 years.\n*   **Alien's average lifespan:** 150 years.\n*   **Question:** How long does the trip take from the astronaut's point of view (Δt₀)?\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the time of the journey in the stationary reference frame (Δt).**\nThis is the time that would be measured by an observer on Earth. The formula is `time = distance / speed`.\n\n*   d = 160,000 light-years\n*   v = 0.99999987 * c\n*   Δt = d / v = (160,000 light-years) / (0.99999987 * c)\n*   Since a light-year is the distance light travels in one year (1 light-year = c * 1 year), we can substitute:\n    Δt = (160,000 * c * years) / (0.99999987 * c)\n*   The speed of light 'c' cancels out:\n    Δt = 160,000 / 0.99999987 years ≈ 160,000.02 years.\n*   For simplicity, we can approximate this as **160,000 years**. From Earth's perspective, the journey takes 160,000 years.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the time in the stationary frame to the proper time in the moving frame. The formula is:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   (v/c)² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - (v/c)² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ √0.00000026 ≈ 0.0005099\n*   γ = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ **1961.16**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀).**\nThe time dilation formula is Δt = γ * Δt₀. We rearrange this to solve for the astronaut's time:\nΔt₀ = Δt / γ\n\n*   Δt ≈ 160,000 years\n*   γ ≈ 1961.16\n*   Δt₀ = 160,000 / 1961.16 ≈ **81.58 years**\n\n**Step 4: Check the astronaut's survival.**\nWe need to ensure the astronaut can survive the trip.\n\n*   Travel time for the astronaut: ~81.6 years.\n*   Astronaut's age upon arrival: 22 (initial age) + 81.6 (travel time) = 103.6 years.\n*   Since 103.6 years is less than the average lifespan of 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey. This eliminates option D.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated time for the journey from the astronaut's perspective is approximately 81.6 years. This value is closest to option C.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Distinction between reference frames:** The key is not to confuse the 160,000 years measured by Earth with the time experienced by the astronaut.\n*   **External Data:** The problem requires knowing the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Different sources might give slightly different values (e.g., 163,000 light-years), which would slightly change the result, but it would still be closest to 81 years.\n*   **Precision:** The speed is extremely close to the speed of light, making the Lorentz factor large. Accurate calculation is important.\n*   **Plausibility Check:** The information about the alien's lifespan is a crucial check to rule out the \"death before arrival\" scenario.\n\nThe final calculated travel time from the astronaut's point of view is approximately 81 years.\n\n<<<C>>>"
