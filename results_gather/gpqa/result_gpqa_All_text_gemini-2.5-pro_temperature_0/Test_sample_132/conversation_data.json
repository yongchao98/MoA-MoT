    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Components and Reactions:**\n    *   The solution is created by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O) in water.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates completely into 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H₂O.\n    *   The key species, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, form a buffer solution. They are a conjugate acid-base pair related by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄).\n    *   The relevant equilibria for phosphoric acid are:\n        1.  H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka₁)\n        2.  H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka₂)\n        3.  HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka₃)\n    *   The question asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is PO₄³⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Moles of the Buffer Components:**\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄:\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the Initial Concentrations of the Buffer Components:**\n    *   The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The pH of the buffer is primarily controlled by the equilibrium between the major components, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. This corresponds to the second dissociation equilibrium (Ka₂).\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.308)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced in the third dissociation step.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   We use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (since Ka₃ is very small, the amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is negligible).\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (5.0562 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.2345 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated concentration, 6.2345 x 10⁻⁷ M, is closest to option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Always convert the volume from cm³ to Liters (1 cm³ = 0.001 L) for molarity calculations.\n*   **Correct Molar Mass:** Be sure to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt (Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O), not the anhydrous form.\n*   **Choosing the Right Ka:** The [H⁺] is determined by the main buffer pair (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻), so Ka₂ is used first. The target ion [PO₄³⁻] is determined by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, so Ka₃ is used in the final step.\n*   **Buffer Assumption:** The calculation assumes that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations. This is a valid assumption because the Ka values are small, and the common ion effect in the buffer minimizes dissociation.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  [H₂PO₄⁻] = (1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol) / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n2.  [HPO₄²⁻] = (1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol) / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n3.  [H⁺] = Ka₂ * [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n4.  [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe final answer matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
