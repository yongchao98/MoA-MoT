    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the concept of density in planets.**\nDensity is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a planet, the volume is determined by its radius. However, the radius of a planet is not just a simple function of its mass. The planet's own gravity compresses its material. The more massive a planet is (assuming the same composition), the stronger its gravity, and the more it will compress its own material, leading to a higher overall density.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each option.**\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This is a description of Earth itself.\n    *   Earth's average density is a known value, approximately 5.51 g/cm³. We will use this as our baseline for comparison.\n    *   **Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³**\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.**\n    *   The density is given directly in the question.\n    *   **Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³**\n    *   This is essentially the same density as Earth.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The key here is \"same composition\" and \"5 times more massive\".\n    *   A planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth will have significantly stronger gravity.\n    *   This stronger gravity will compress the planet's materials (its iron core and silicate mantle) much more than in Earth.\n    *   This increased compression means the material is packed into a smaller volume than it would be otherwise, resulting in a higher overall density.\n    *   Therefore, this planet's density must be greater than Earth's density.\n    *   **Density > 5.51 g/cm³**\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the opposite scenario of option c.\n    *   A planet with less mass has weaker gravity.\n    *   With weaker gravity, the planet's materials are less compressed than they are in Earth.\n    *   This means the planet is \"fluffier\" or less dense than Earth.\n    *   Therefore, this planet's density must be less than Earth's density.\n    *   **Density < 5.51 g/cm³**\n\n**Step 3: Compare the densities and conclude.**\n\nLet's summarize the densities:\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nComparing these values, the planet described in option (c) is the only one that is definitively denser than Earth. The planet in option (d) is less dense, and the planets in options (a) and (b) have densities that are effectively the same as Earth's.\n\nTherefore, the planet with 5 Earth masses has the highest density due to gravitational self-compression.\n\n<<<B>>>"
