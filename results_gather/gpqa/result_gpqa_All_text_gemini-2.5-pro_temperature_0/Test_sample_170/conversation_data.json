    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and directing effects of substituents**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The substituent already on the benzene ring (C6H5-) directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) to specific positions. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the nature of this substituent.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents**\nWe need to classify the substituents into two main categories:\n1.  **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The products are a mixture of ortho and para isomers.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl group)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl group)\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro group)\n2.  **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is formed in very small amounts.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro group)\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxyl group)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ester group)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the para-isomer yield for meta-directors**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring towards ortho/para attack.\n*   The deactivating strength of these groups follows the order: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator, so it will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The -COOC2H5 group is the weakest deactivator among the three, so it will give the highest yield of the para-isomer among this group.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the para-isomer yield for ortho, para-directors**\nSubstances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 3, 5) will have much higher yields of the para-isomer. The distribution between the ortho and para positions depends on steric and electronic factors. A higher para/ortho ratio leads to a higher percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The para position is sterically unhindered, while the ortho positions are adjacent to the substituent. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer. The order of steric bulk is: -C2H5 > -CH3 > -Cl.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** For halogens like -Cl, a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates the ortho position more than the para position, which also favors para substitution.\n*   **Comparing the groups:**\n    *   **-CH3 (1):** The methyl group has moderate steric bulk. The para-isomer is favored over the ortho, but the ortho product is still significant. (Para yield is ~67%).\n    *   **-Cl (3):** The combination of steric hindrance and the strong deactivating inductive effect at the ortho position makes the para-isomer highly favored. (Para yield is ~87%).\n    *   **-C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group is significantly bulkier than the methyl group. This large steric hindrance makes the para-isomer extremely favored. (Para yield is ~94%).\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is: 1 < 3 < 5.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results to get the final order**\nWe combine the two groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n*   Order of meta-directors: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: 1 < 3 < 5\n*   Combining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the given options**\nLet's check the provided options against our derived correct order (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5).\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect.\n*   B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - This option correctly orders the meta-directors (4 < 6 < 2) and correctly identifies toluene (1) as the least para-selective of the o,p-directors. However, it incorrectly swaps the order of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). The correct order is 3 < 5, not 5 < 3.\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect.\n*   D) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect.\n\nAmong the given choices, option B is the closest to the chemically correct order. It correctly orders the first four substances in the sequence (4 < 6 < 2 < 1). The only error is the relative order of the last two substances. In the context of a multiple-choice question with a likely error, this is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
