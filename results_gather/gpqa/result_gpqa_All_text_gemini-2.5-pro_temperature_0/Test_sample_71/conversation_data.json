    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction to form product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a substituted norbornadiene, NBD) and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Identifying the reactive diene:** The reagent 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is an unusual and complex precursor. A very common and structurally related precursor used in such problems is 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene. It is highly probable that the provided name is a complex and obscure precursor, or a typo, for the common reactive diene, *o*-xylylene (also known as *o*-quinodimethane). The reaction of 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene with NaI is a standard method to generate *o*-xylylene *in situ*. We will proceed with the assumption that the reactive diene is *o*-xylylene.\n*   **Reaction type:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. *o*-xylylene acts as the diene, and the norbornadiene derivative acts as the dienophile.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The norbornadiene has two double bonds, and it reacts with two equivalents of the diene precursor. This indicates that two successive Diels-Alder reactions occur, one at each double bond of the norbornadiene.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The bulky 7-(tert-butoxy) group will sterically hinder the *syn* face of the norbornadiene system. The Diels-Alder reaction will preferentially occur via *exo* attack on both double bonds.\n*   **Product 1:** The product, **1**, is the *exo,exo*-double Diels-Alder adduct of 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene and two molecules of *o*-xylylene. This is a highly symmetric molecule with a C2v point group.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4/H2O).\n*   **Reaction type:** This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group is readily cleaved under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The tert-butoxy group (-OC(CH3)3) is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH). Product **2** is the corresponding alcohol, which retains the same polycyclic skeleton and C2v symmetry as **1**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **2** is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Reaction type:** This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing alcohols.\n*   **Product 3:** The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (C=O). Product **3** is the corresponding ketone, which also maintains the C2v symmetry of the skeleton.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of final product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product **3** is heated at 150°C.\n*   **Reaction type:** Heating a Diels-Alder adduct often leads to a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, which is entropically favored at high temperatures.\n*   **Fragmentation:** Product **3** is a double Diels-Alder adduct. Heating will cause it to break apart in a sequence of retro-Diels-Alder reactions.\n    *   **3** → (mono-adduct) + *o*-xylylene\n    *   (mono-adduct) → bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one + *o*-xylylene\n*   **Decomposition of the dienophile:** The intermediate, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one, is thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination of carbon monoxide (CO) to form benzene (C6H6). This is a well-known fragmentation reaction.\n*   **Fate of the diene:** The other product of the retro-Diels-Alder reaction is the highly reactive *o*-xylylene. In the absence of other trapping agents, *o*-xylylene will dimerize. Dimerization can occur in several ways, but a common product is the [4+4] cycloadduct, dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The question asks for the analysis of the final product **4**. While the overall reaction produces a mixture of benzene, CO, and the *o*-xylylene dimer, typically such questions refer to the most complex stable organic product formed. Benzene has only one type of hydrogen, which is not among the options (A-D). Therefore, it is logical to conclude that **4** is the dimer of *o*-xylylene.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in 4**\n\n*   **Structure of 4:** We assume **4** is the [4+4] dimer of *o*-xylylene, which is dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene. This molecule exists in a stable tub-shaped conformation with C2 symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The C2 axis of symmetry relates the two benzene rings and the two aliphatic bridges.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** There are 8 aromatic protons in total. We only need to analyze one benzene ring, as the other is identical by symmetry. The benzene ring is ortho-disubstituted by two non-identical aliphatic groups (as part of the 8-membered ring). Therefore, the four protons on this ring are all chemically distinct (an ABCD system). This gives **4 distinct signals** for the 8 aromatic protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are 8 aliphatic protons in two -CH2-CH2- bridges. The C2 symmetry makes the two bridges equivalent. Let's analyze one bridge. The two -CH2- groups within the bridge are not equivalent. Furthermore, the two protons on each -CH2- group are diastereotopic due to the rigid, chiral conformation of the ring system. Thus, all four protons of one bridge are distinct. This gives **4 distinct signals** for the 8 aliphatic protons.\n*   **Total Signals:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of the distinct aromatic and aliphatic protons.\n    Total signals = 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = 8.\n\nThis number matches one of the given options.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  The interpretation of the starting material as a precursor to *o*-xylylene is a common approach for such problems.\n2.  The reaction sequence (Diels-Alder, hydrolysis, oxidation) is standard.\n3.  The thermal decomposition (retro-Diels-Alder followed by fragmentation and dimerization) is a chemically sound pathway.\n4.  The symmetry analysis of the resulting dimer, dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene, leads to 8 distinct proton signals.\n\nThis provides a consistent and logical path to one of the answers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
