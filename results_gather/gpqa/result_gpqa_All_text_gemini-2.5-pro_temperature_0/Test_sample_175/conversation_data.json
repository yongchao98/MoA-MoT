    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   **Initial State Vector (`|ψ⟩`):** The system is initially in the state represented by the column matrix `[-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   **Operator P:** The observable P is represented by the matrix:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   **Operator Q:** The observable Q is represented by the matrix:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. Normalize the Initial State Vector**\n\nBefore performing any calculations, the state vector must be normalized. A normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` has a length (norm) of 1.\n*   First, calculate the square of the norm of `|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n*   The norm is the square root of this value: `||ψ|| = √6`.\n*   The normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` is obtained by dividing the original vector by its norm:\n    `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n**3. Analyze the First Measurement (Measurement of P)**\n\nThe problem states that P is measured first, and we are interested in the outcome being 0.\n\n*   **Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of P:** The possible outcomes of measuring P are its eigenvalues. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation is `P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩`, or `(P - λI)|v⟩ = 0`. For `λ = 0`, this is `P|v⟩ = 0`.\n    *   Let the eigenvector be `|v_0⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n        `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n    *   This gives the system of equations:\n        1.  `y/√2 = 0  => y = 0`\n        2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0 => x + z = 0 => x = -z`\n    *   The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. To get a normalized eigenvector, we set its length to 1: `x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1 => 2x² = 1 => x = 1/√2`.\n    *   So, the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue `P=0` is:\n        `|v_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n*   **Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0:** The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n    *   `Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    *   First, calculate the inner product `⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩`:\n        `⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) * ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T )`\n        `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*(1))`\n        `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/√12 = -1/√3`\n    *   Now, square the magnitude:\n        `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n**4. State Collapse After the First Measurement**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system \"collapses\" into the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|v_0⟩`.\n*   The new state of the system, let's call it `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n    `|ψ'⟩ = |v_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n**5. Analyze the Second Measurement (Measurement of Q)**\n\nNow, the observable Q is measured on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. We are interested in the outcome being -1.\n\n*   **Find the Eigenvector of Q for the outcome -1:**\n    *   The matrix Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, and -1.\n    *   The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `Q = -1` is the third standard basis vector:\n        `|q_{-1}⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`\n\n*   **Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1:** This is the conditional probability of getting `Q=-1` given that the system is in the state `|ψ'⟩`.\n    *   `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²`\n    *   First, calculate the inner product `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩`:\n        `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] * ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T )`\n        `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))`\n        `= -1/√2`\n    *   Now, square the magnitude:\n        `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Joint Probability**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n\n*   `Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n*   `Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThe final probability is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
