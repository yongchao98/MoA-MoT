    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The shift in the wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the star along our line of sight. The formula is:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the *maximum* periodic shift, which corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is the amplitude of the RV curve, denoted as $K$.\n    *   For planet #1, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, the maximum shift is $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} = 7$ miliangstrom.\n\n    Since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, we can find the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_*$ in a circular orbit with period $P$, the RV amplitude $K$ is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_*^{2/3}}$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions and Assumptions**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{*,1} = M_{*,2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p,1} = m_{p,2}$.\n    *   The problem does not mention the orbital inclinations. A standard and necessary assumption in such problems is that the viewing conditions are comparable, meaning the inclinations are the same: $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct relationship between $K$ and $P$:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio of the Periods**\n    From the relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write:\n    $K \\cdot P^{1/3} = \\text{constant}$\n\n    Applying this to our two systems:\n    $K_1 \\cdot P_1^{1/3} = K_2 \\cdot P_2^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n    $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\n    To solve for $P_2 / P_1$, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$. Therefore, the inverse ratio is $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n    Now, substitute this value into our equation for the period ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** The core of the problem is understanding that the maximum wavelength shift is directly proportional to the RV amplitude $K$.\n*   **Key Formula:** The relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ is crucial. It is derived by combining the definition of the star's velocity due to its planet with Kepler's Third Law.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the stated conditions (equal star and planet masses) and the implicit assumption that the orbital inclinations are the same for both systems.\n*   **Inverse Relationship:** A larger RV amplitude ($K$) implies a stronger gravitational pull at a closer distance, which means a shorter orbital period ($P$). Since planet #2 induces a larger shift ($K_2 > K_1$), its period must be shorter ($P_2 < P_1$), so the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. This provides a quick sanity check of the result.\n*   **Exponents:** It is easy to make a mistake with the exponents. The final ratio is cubed, not taken to the power of 1/3 or -1/3. The ratio of periods is $(K_1/K_2)^3$, not $(K_2/K_1)^3$.\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
