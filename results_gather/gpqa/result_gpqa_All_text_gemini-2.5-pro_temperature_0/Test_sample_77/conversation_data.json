    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Scenario:** We are dealing with a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, the scalar potential `V` and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$, at a specific point in space $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n\n2.  **Concept of Retarded Potentials:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$. The information (the field) had to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\n3.  **Define Key Quantities:**\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The field point (observation point).\n    *   $t$: The time of observation.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time $t_r$. This is the source point.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\n4.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the signal to travel the distance `d` is $d/c$. This leads to the fundamental equation for the retarded time:\n    $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n    This is an implicit equation for $t_r$, as $t_r$ appears on both sides.\n\n5.  **General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:** The general solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials in the Lorenz gauge are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $\\rho$ is the charge density and $\\vec{J}$ is the current density, and $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n6.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` at position $\\vec{s}(t)$, the densities are:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Integrals (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):** Substituting these densities into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals is a non-trivial task because the retarded time $t_r'$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard result of this evaluation gives the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n    The key result of the integration is that the effective charge seen by the observer is modified by a Doppler-like factor. The denominator of the static potential, $4\\pi\\epsilon_0 d$, gets modified.\n\n    The resulting potentials are:\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n        where $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observer. The subscript $t_r$ means all quantities inside the bracket (d, $\\hat{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n8.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** Let's rewrite the denominator to match the options provided:\n    $d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the potential expressions:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Retardation is Key:** The potentials are not determined by the charge's current position and velocity, but by its position and velocity at the retarded time $t_r$. Options A and C use the static form for V, which is incorrect.\n*   **The Denominator Factor:** The term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is crucial. It is not simply `dc`. This term accounts for the relativistic effect of the charge's motion on the potential. If the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential becomes larger. This is analogous to the Doppler effect for sound or light waves.\n*   **Sign Convention:** The sign in the denominator is negative: $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. A positive sign, as in option D, is incorrect and would describe an unphysical situation.\n*   **Relationship between V and A:** Notice that $\\vec{A} = (\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v}) V$. Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, this simplifies to $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. This is a fundamental relationship for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived expressions with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect V and A.\n*   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   C) Incorrect V.\n*   D) Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
