    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of total energy. In a relativistic system, the total energy is not just kinetic plus potential, but includes the rest mass energy.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy of the system:** The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the relativistic oscillator at any point in its motion is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. This term includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($(\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    *   The potential energy stored in the spring due to the force $F=-kx$ is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Analyze the system at the point of maximum amplitude (turning point):**\n    *   At the maximum amplitude, the position is $x = A$.\n    *   At this turning point, the mass momentarily stops, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   We can calculate the total energy of the system by substituting these values into the energy equation:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    *   Since energy is conserved, this value of $E_{total}$ is constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the system at the point of maximum speed:**\n    *   The maximum speed, which we'll call $v_{max}$, occurs when the potential energy is at its minimum. For a harmonic oscillator, this happens at the equilibrium position, $x = 0$.\n    *   At this point, the potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The speed is $v = v_{max}$. The corresponding Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n5.  **Apply the principle of energy conservation:** We equate the expression for total energy at the turning point (Step 3) with the expression for total energy at the point of maximum speed (Step 4).\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:** Now, we perform algebraic manipulation to isolate $v_{max}$.\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   To solve for the square root term, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical:** The key is to use the relativistic energy formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$, not the classical kinetic energy $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Using the classical formula would lead to the incorrect answer $v_{max} = \\sqrt{kA^2/m}$ (Option B).\n*   **Total Energy:** The conserved quantity is the sum of the particle's total relativistic energy and the external potential energy. It's a common mistake to only consider kinetic energy.\n*   **System States:** Correctly identifying the conditions at the two key points (maximum amplitude and maximum speed) is crucial. At maximum amplitude $x=A$, speed $v=0$. At maximum speed $v=v_{max}$, position $x=0$.\n*   **Algebra:** The algebraic steps to isolate $v_{max}$ must be done carefully, especially the inversion and squaring operations.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe derived expression for the maximum speed is $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
