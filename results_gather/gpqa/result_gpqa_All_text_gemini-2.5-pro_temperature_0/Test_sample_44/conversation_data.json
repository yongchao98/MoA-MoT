    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n### **Careful Points and Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the System:**\n    *   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n    *   **Governing Principle:** The behavior of these fermions is governed by the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by a complete set of quantum numbers, which in this case includes the energy level quantum number (*n*) and the spin magnetic quantum number (*m_s*).\n    *   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy States:**\n    *   The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n        $E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2mL^2)$\n        where *n* = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit $E = (pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2mL^2)$.\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed in terms of E:\n        *   $E_1 = 1^2 * E = E$\n        *   $E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E$\n        *   $E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E$\n        *   $E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E$\n        *   and so on.\n    *   **Spin States:** Since the particles are spin-1/2, the spin quantum number *m_s* can be either +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n    *   **State Occupancy:** Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Ground State Energy ($E_{ground}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we must place the four fermions into the lowest possible energy levels without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   The lowest energy level is n=1 (energy E). We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   We have two particles remaining. The next lowest energy level is n=2 (energy 4E). We can place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   All four particles are now placed in the lowest possible configuration.\n\nThe configuration is:\n*   2 particles in the n=1 state.\n*   2 particles in the n=2 state.\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of the individual particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)$\n$E_{ground} = (2 * E) + (2 * 4E)$\n$E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st\\_excited}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy that is higher than the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   Promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   2 particles in the n=1 state.\n*   1 particle in the n=2 state.\n*   1 particle in the n=3 state.\n\nThe total energy is:\n$E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)$\n$E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)$\n$E_{1st\\_excited} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd\\_excited}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (achieved by promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3).\n\nLet's consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states we have found:\n*   First excited state: 15E\n*   Next possible energy: 18E\n*   Another possible energy: 22E\n\nThe state with the next lowest energy after 15E is 18E. Therefore, this is the second excited state.\n\n$E_{2nd\\_excited} = 18E$\n\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
