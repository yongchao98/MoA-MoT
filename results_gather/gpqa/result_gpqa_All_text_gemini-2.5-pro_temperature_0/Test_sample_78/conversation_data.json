    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra to Determine its Structure**\n\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of the product from the provided 1H and 13C NMR data. The product is the result of a reaction on Compound X (C11H12O), and since the reaction conditions (heating with a base catalyst) suggest an isomerization or rearrangement, the product will also have the molecular formula C11H12O.\n\n*   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically in the range for a ketone.\n    *   **δ 126.9 - 144.1:** There are six signals in this range, corresponding to 8 sp2 hybridized carbons (from a benzene ring and a C=C double bond). The signals at 126.9 ppm and 129.1 ppm each account for two carbons, suggesting some symmetry.\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s):** These are two signals in the aliphatic region, corresponding to sp3 hybridized carbons.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two sharp singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This indicates two methyl (CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons. Common environments for such singlets are a methyl group on an aromatic ring (Ar-CH3), an acetyl group (CH3-C=O), or a methyl group on a quaternary carbon.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton, are characteristic of two protons on a double bond that are coupled to each other (-CH=CH-). The trans configuration is most likely, which would result in a large coupling constant (J-value), seen as clear doublets.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a ketone group (C=O).\n    2.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    3.  We have a -CH=CH- group.\n    4.  We have two methyl groups.\n    5.  One methyl group must be on the para-disubstituted ring (forming a p-tolyl group), accounting for one singlet. The other methyl group must be part of an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH3), accounting for the second singlet.\n    6.  Connecting these fragments (p-tolyl, -CH=CH-, and acetyl) gives the structure: **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    Structure: CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3\n\n    This structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data and has the correct molecular formula, C11H12O. The high degree of conjugation (ring, C=C, C=O) explains the downfield chemical shifts observed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X to the product identified above. The reaction is carried out at high temperature (403 K) for a long duration (1 day), which favors the formation of the most thermodynamically stable product. The identified product, a fully conjugated ketone, is indeed a very stable isomer.\n\nIn an isomerization reaction, the atoms are rearranged, but the fundamental carbon skeleton is conserved. The product contains a **p-tolyl group** (a para-substituted ring with a methyl group). Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a p-tolyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options for Compound X**\n\nLet's examine the structures of the given options:\n\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula is C10H10O, which does not match C11H12O. This option is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The structure is C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH3). This contains a phenyl group (C6H5-), not a p-tolyl group. This cannot be Compound X.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The structure is CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2. The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is another name for a \"p-vinylphenyl\" group attached via its vinyl part. This structure contains a p-tolyl group attached to a vinyl epoxide moiety. This is a plausible candidate for Compound X.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** The structure is C6H5-CH=C(CH3)-CH(O)CH2. This contains a phenyl group (C6H5-), not a p-tolyl group. This cannot be Compound X.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the product of the reaction contains a p-tolyl group. Since the reaction is an isomerization, the starting material must also possess this same structural feature. Among the given options, only **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane** has a p-tolyl group. Therefore, it is the only possible structure for Compound X. The reaction is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of this vinyl epoxide to the thermodynamically more stable conjugated ketone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
