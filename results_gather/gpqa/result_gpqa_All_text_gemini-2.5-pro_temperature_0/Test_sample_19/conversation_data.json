    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided assumptions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concept: The Impulse Approximation**\n\nThe impulse approximation is a fundamental concept in nuclear and particle physics used to describe high-energy scattering off a bound system, like a nucleus. The core idea is to simplify a complex many-body interaction into a sum of simpler, two-body interactions. Specifically, it assumes that the interaction between an external probe (like an electron or neutrino) and the nucleus happens with just *one* of the constituent nucleons, and that this nucleon behaves as if it were a *free* particle during the brief moment of interaction. The name \"impulse\" comes from the idea that the interaction delivers a sharp, instantaneous \"kick\" or impulse to one nucleon.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Assumption in the Context of the Impulse Approximation**\n\n*   **Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the most basic requirement. The impulse approximation models the total interaction as a sum of interactions with individual nucleons. If the probe could interact with multiple nucleons simultaneously (e.g., via meson-exchange currents, which are two-body currents), the entire premise of treating the interaction as a single-nucleon event would fail.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This assumption separates one-body interaction terms from more complex many-body terms. The impulse approximation specifically deals with the one-body terms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is **essential**.\n\n*   **Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This assumption addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. It means that the incoming probe travels to the target nucleon without interacting with other nucleons, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) leave the nucleus without any further scattering. These secondary scatterings are known as \"initial-state interactions\" and \"final-state interactions\".\n    *   **Careful Point:** The impulse approximation in its purest form ignores these effects to keep the calculation simple. If the nucleus were not \"transparent,\" the final measured state would be a complicated result of multiple scatterings, not the clean single-nucleon event the approximation assumes.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is **essential** for the simplest form of the impulse approximation.\n\n*   **Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This assumption deals with the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is concerned with the nucleon's behavior as a constituent of the *nucleus*. It approximates the nucleon's interaction with the probe by ignoring its interaction with *other nucleons*.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Whether the quarks inside the nucleon are relativistic or not is a separate physical question and a different level of approximation. One can use the impulse approximation while still treating the nucleon as a complex relativistic system of quarks and gluons (which is necessary for describing deep inelastic scattering). The impulse approximation is about the nucleon's environment, not its internal composition.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is **not essential** for the impulse approximation itself.\n\n*   **Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction is assumed to be so rapid that the relatively slow-acting nuclear forces that bind the nucleon have no time to act *during* the collision. The nucleon is essentially \"frozen\" in its state of motion at the moment of impact and interacts as a free particle with that specific momentum.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is valid when the energy transferred by the probe is much larger than the binding energy of the nucleon. The interaction time is inversely proportional to the energy transfer, so high energy means short interaction time.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This assumption is **essential**.\n\n### Final Synthesis\n\nTo jointly imply the impulse approximation, we need the assumptions that define it. Based on the analysis:\n*   Assumption 1 is required to define the interaction as a single-nucleon process.\n*   Assumption 2 is required to isolate this single-nucleon process from other nuclear effects (initial and final state interactions).\n*   Assumption 4 is required to treat the target nucleon as \"free\" from the nuclear potential during the interaction.\n\nAssumption 3 is an independent approximation about the internal structure of the nucleon and is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
