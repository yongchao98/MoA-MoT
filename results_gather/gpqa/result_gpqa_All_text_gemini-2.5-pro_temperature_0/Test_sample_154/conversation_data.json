    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Formula for Uncertainty**\nThe uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the standard deviation:\n$\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\nFor our problem, this becomes:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Given Information**\nWe are given the matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ and the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n*   The operator $P_z$ is:\n    $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. This is consistent with the fact that the matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal. The diagonal elements $(\\hbar, 0, -\\hbar)$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Expectation Value of $P_z$, denoted as $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\nThe expectation value is calculated using the formula $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n\n*   First, we need the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it is simply the transpose:\n    $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   Next, we calculate the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ (-\\hbar) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   Finally, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Expectation Value of $P_z^2$, denoted as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\nThe expectation value is calculated using the formula $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n\n*   First, we find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   Next, we calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   Finally, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\nNow we substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula.\n\n*   $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n*   $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2}$\n*   $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
