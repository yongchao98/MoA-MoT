    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Parent structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The three substituents are all *meta* to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is critical in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because existing groups on the ring direct new groups to specific positions.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino group):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Key Reaction Considerations**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (e.g., CH3COCl/AlCl3):** This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) or on rings with an amino group (-NH2) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic nitrogen atom.\n*   **Synthesis Strategy for 1,3,5-Trisubstituted Benzene:** A common strategy to create a 1,3,5-pattern is to start by introducing a *meta*-director. This director can then guide the next two substitutions.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option**\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) `Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene`: This is correct. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n*   ii) `Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → p-Bromonitrobenzene` (major product): The *o,p*-directing -Br group places the -NO2 group mainly at the para position.\n*   iii) `p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?`: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group. This reaction will fail or give a very low yield. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   i) `Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene`: Correct.\n*   ii) `Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline`: Correct reduction.\n*   iii) `Aniline + NaNO2/HCl → Benzenediazonium salt`: Correct diazotization.\n*   iv) `Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 → Benzene`: Correct deamination.\n*   This sequence of steps (ii, iii, iv) converts nitrobenzene back to benzene, making the entire process pointless. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) `Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene`: Correct.\n*   ii) `Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline`: Correct.\n*   iii) `Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ?`: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid AlCl3 coordinates with the basic amino group, creating a strongly deactivating -NH3+ type group. This sequence is incorrect. (Even if interpreted as N-acylation followed by other steps, it leads to the wrong isomer).\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) `Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone`: This Friedel-Crafts acylation is a standard reaction. It correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director. This is an excellent first step for achieving a 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   ii) `Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone`: The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (position 3). The structure is now 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a correct and logical step.\n*   iii) `3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`: Now we nitrate the ring which has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1, *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, *o,p*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the new group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The positions ortho to the acetyl group (2 and 6) are strongly deactivated and sterically hindered. The directing effect of the -COCH3 group is dominant in this case. Therefore, the nitro group will add to position 5.\n    *   This step successfully yields the target molecule: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   iv) - vii): The remaining steps (`Fe/HCl`, `HNO3/H2SO4`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3PO2`) are chemically nonsensical in this context. They would reduce the nitro group just added and then eventually remove it, reverting the product to an earlier intermediate. This is very likely an error in the question's options. However, the first three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, the sequence of reactions in the first three steps of option D is the only chemically sound pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The other options fail due to incorrect regiochemistry or unfeasible reactions. Despite the extraneous later steps listed in option D, it contains the correct synthetic route.\n\n<<<D>>>"
