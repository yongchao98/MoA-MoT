    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons and basic functional groups.**\n*   First, let's sum the integrations of all the signals: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n*   Let's compare this to the number of protons in the possible compounds:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (CH3COOCH=CHCH3, formula C5H8O2) has 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8 protons.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (e.g., CH3COOCH=CHCH2CH3, formula C6H10O2) has 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10 protons.\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the spectrum shows a total of 8 protons, the compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and D (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n*   The signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)** is a singlet with an integration of 3 protons. Its chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an acetyl group, CH3-C=O). The singlet multiplicity indicates it has no adjacent protons to couple with, which is consistent with an acetate group (CH3COO-).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the signals in the vinylic region (related to the C=C double bond).**\n*   There are two signals in the vinylic region: **7.0 ppm (1H, d)** and **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**. These correspond to the two protons on the double bond.\n*   The key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry (cis or trans) is the coupling constant (J value) between these two vinylic protons.\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   **Careful Point:** For protons on a double bond, the coupling constant provides crucial stereochemical information:\n    *   A large coupling constant (typically J = 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** relationship.\n    *   A smaller coupling constant (typically J = 6-12 Hz) indicates a **cis** relationship.\n*   Since the observed J value is 16.0 Hz, the two protons on the double bond are in a **trans** configuration. This eliminates option C (Cis-propenyl acetate).\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the structure and verify all signals.**\n*   Based on the analysis so far, the compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's verify that its structure is consistent with the entire spectrum.\n*   **Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n    ```\n        O                (b)\n       //                 H\n    (a)CH3-C-O      \\    /\n                      C==C\n                     /    \\\n                   (c)H    (d)CH3\n    ```\n*   **Signal (a) - CH3COO-:** A methyl group with no adjacent protons. Predicted: singlet, ~2.1 ppm. **Observed: 2.1 ppm (3H, s).** This matches.\n*   **Signal (b) - O-CH=:** A vinylic proton deshielded by the adjacent electron-withdrawing oxygen atom. It is coupled only to proton (c). Predicted: doublet, downfield shift (>6.5 ppm), trans coupling. **Observed: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz).** This matches perfectly.\n*   **Signal (c) - =CH-CH3:** A vinylic proton coupled to proton (b) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of methyl group (d) (giving a quartet). Predicted: doublet of quartets (dq). **Observed: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq).** This matches.\n*   **Signal (d) - =CH-CH3:** An allylic methyl group coupled to proton (c). Predicted: doublet. **Observed: 1.6 ppm (3H, d).** This matches.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll the data points (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities, and coupling constants) are fully consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
