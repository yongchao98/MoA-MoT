    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the description and draw the molecule.**\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n2.  **Principal Functional Group:** The description includes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN). According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n3.  **Placing Substituents relative to C1 (-COOH):**\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO) and a cyano group (-CN) are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C3 and C5.\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. This places it at C4.\n\n    So far, the structure looks like this:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH₃)₂\n    *   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH₃\n\n4.  **Using Cross-Reference Information to Finalize Positions:**\n    *   The description states that the methoxy group (-OCH₃) and the alcohol (-OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4. For it to be ortho to the nitrile, the nitrile (-CN) must be at either C3 or C5. This is consistent with our current placement.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile (-CN).\n        *   **Case 1: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions are C2 and C4. C4 is taken by -OCH₃. So, -OH must be at C2. This leaves C6 for -N(CH₃)₂ and C5 for -CHO.\n        *   **Case 2: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions are C4 and C6. C4 is taken by -OCH₃. So, -OH must be at C6. This leaves C2 for -N(CH₃)₂ and C3 for -CHO.\n\n    Both cases result in a valid structure that fits the description. The final IUPAC name will be determined by the numbering rules. Let's analyze the structure from Case 1.\n\n    **Structure (from Case 1):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH₃\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂\n\n**Step 2: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules.**\n\n1.  **Identify C1:** The carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is C1.\n2.  **Direction of Numbering:** We need to number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (positions) to the substituents. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   **Clockwise:** The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is {2,3,4,5,6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise:** The substituents are also at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is {2,3,4,5,6}.\n3.  **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When both numbering directions result in the same lowest locant set, we must give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n4.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:** The prefixes for the substituents are:\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n5.  **Apply the Tie-Breaker:**\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n    *   Let's look at our structure and the two numbering directions:\n        *   **Numbering Clockwise:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂). In this scheme, **cyano is at C3**.\n        *   **Numbering Counter-Clockwise:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH₃)₂), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CN), C6(-OH). In this scheme, **cyano is at C5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise numbering scheme is correct**.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Final IUPAC Name.**\n\n1.  **List the substituents with their correct locants (from the clockwise numbering):**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n2.  **Arrange these prefixes in alphabetical order:**\n    *   3-cyano-\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)-\n    *   5-formyl-\n    *   2-hydroxy-\n    *   4-methoxy-\n3.  **Combine with the parent name:**\n    3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and alphabetization)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Matches our derived name)\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetization)\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetization)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one that matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
