    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the energy of the nucleus.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Nucleus and its Composition**\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus X is \"Li with 3 neutrons\".\n*   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it contains 3 protons.\n*   The number of neutrons (N) is given as 3.\n*   The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Rest Mass ($m_0$) and Rest Energy ($E_0$) of the Nucleus**\n*   In relativistic problems, the total energy of a particle depends on its rest mass. The rest mass of a nucleus can be approximated by its mass number (A) multiplied by the mass of a single nucleon (a proton or a neutron).\n*   The mass of a proton ($m_p$) is approximately 938.27 MeV/c².\n*   The mass of a neutron ($m_n$) is approximately 939.57 MeV/c².\n*   Since the options are given with high precision, the choice of nucleon mass will be important. Let's calculate the rest mass using the neutron mass, as it is slightly heavier and often used in such approximations.\n*   Approximated rest mass of $^6$Li: $m_0 = A \\times m_n = 6 \\times 939.57 \\text{ MeV/c}^2 = 5637.42 \\text{ MeV/c}^2$.\n*   The rest energy ($E_0$) is given by Einstein's famous equation $E_0 = m_0 c^2$.\n*   $E_0 = 5637.42 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   To match the units of the answers, we convert this to GeV: $E_0 = 5.63742 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n*   The speed of the nucleus is given as $v = 0.96c$, where c is the speed of light.\n*   The velocity is expressed as a fraction of c, so $\\beta = v/c = 0.96$.\n*   The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, is a measure of the relativistic effect and is calculated using the formula:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n*   First, calculate $\\beta^2$:\n    $\\beta^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216$\n*   Next, calculate $1 - \\beta^2$:\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784$\n*   Now, take the square root:\n    $\\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28$\n*   Finally, calculate $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} = \\frac{25}{7} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n*   The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is the product of its Lorentz factor and its rest energy:\n    $E = \\gamma E_0$\n*   Using the values we calculated:\n    $E = (\\frac{25}{7}) \\times 5.63742 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5.63742 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E \\approx 20.1336 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Result with the Given Options**\n*   The calculated total energy is approximately 20.1336 GeV.\n*   Let's examine the options:\n    A) 23.069 GeV\n    B) 20.132 GeV\n    C) 18.475 GeV\n    D) 21.419 GeV\n*   Our calculated value of 20.1336 GeV is extremely close to option B, 20.132 GeV. The small difference is due to the precise value of the neutron mass used in the problem's design.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Nucleus Identification:** Correctly determining that X is $^6$Li (A=6) is the first critical step.\n2.  **Rest Mass Approximation:** The choice of the rest mass for the nucleus is the most sensitive part of the calculation. Approximating it as $A \\times m_n$ yields a result that aligns perfectly with one of the options. Using the proton mass ($A \\times m_p$) would give E ≈ 20.106 GeV, which is also close to B but not as close. Using the actual nuclear mass of $^6$Li (which accounts for binding energy) would give E ≈ 20.005 GeV. The proximity of the result using $m_n$ to option B strongly suggests it is the intended method.\n3.  **Lorentz Factor:** The calculation for $\\gamma$ is straightforward but must be done accurately. The fact that $\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}$ simplifies to a clean decimal (0.28) is a common feature in physics problems of this type.\n4.  **Total Energy vs. Kinetic Energy:** The question asks for the \"energy\", which in a relativistic context implies the total energy ($E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$), not just the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma - 1)m_0 c^2$).\n5.  **Units:** Ensure consistency in units, converting the rest energy from MeV to GeV before the final calculation to match the options.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is 20.132 GeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
