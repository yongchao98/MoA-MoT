    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the suitable reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a ketone (butan-2-one) to a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a classic nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The first step is the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻), provided by NaCN, on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond and forms a new C-C bond, resulting in a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   The second step is the protonation of this negatively charged alkoxide intermediate to form the neutral hydroxyl group (-OH) of the final cyanohydrin product.\n    *   This protonation requires a source of protons, which is an acid.\n\n3.  **Evaluate reagent 'A':**\n    *   Reagent 'A' must be an acid to provide the proton (H⁺) needed for the second step.\n    *   The options for 'A' are NaHSO₃ and H₃O⁺.\n    *   NaHSO₃ is a salt used in bisulfite addition reactions, which is a different type of reaction. While it can be slightly acidic, it is not the standard or most effective reagent for protonating the alkoxide in cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   H₃O⁺ represents a generic strong acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄). This is the correct type of reagent to provide the necessary proton to complete the reaction. The reaction is typically performed by generating HCN *in situ* from NaCN and a mineral acid, or by adding acid in a workup step. In either case, an acid (represented by H₃O⁺) is required.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** A = H₃O⁺. This narrows down the choices to options C and D.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄). The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate and directly yields the carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH). This initially forms a carboxylate salt and ammonia. A subsequent acidification step is required to protonate the carboxylate salt to obtain the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   Since the reaction is shown as a single transformation yielding the carboxylic acid directly, acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is the most fitting description.\n\n3.  **Evaluate reagent 'B':**\n    *   Reagent 'B' must be a catalyst for the hydrolysis. We are choosing between the reagents from options C and D.\n    *   Option C suggests B = CH₃COOH (acetic acid). Acetic acid is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Option D suggests B = HCl (hydrochloric acid). Hydrochloric acid is a strong mineral acid and is a standard, effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** B = HCl.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, reagent A must be an acid, represented by **H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction, reagent B must be a strong acid for hydrolysis, which is **HCl**.\n*   Combining these findings, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
