    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the core physical principles and given information.**\n\n*   **The Problem:** We are asked to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) for an electron.\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Speed of the electron, v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s.\n    *   Uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n*   **Relevant Principle:** The problem involves uncertainties in position and energy. This points directly to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The key is to connect the uncertainty in position (Δx) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n\n**2. Use the Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle.**\n\n*   The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) to the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp). The mathematical relationship for the minimum uncertainty is:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n*   We can use this principle to find the minimum uncertainty in the electron's momentum (Δp).\n    Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Δp = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δp ≈ 5.27 × 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n\n*   This is the most critical step. We need a relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p). The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the derivative of energy with respect to momentum.\n    ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) ⋅ Δp\n*   **Careful Point:** We need to determine the expression for dE/dp. The speed of the electron (v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s), so we should use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    Differentiating both sides with respect to p:\n    2E ⋅ (dE/dp) = 2p ⋅ c²\n    dE/dp = pc² / E\n    Using the relativistic definitions E = γm₀c² and p = γm₀v, we can substitute for E:\n    dE/dp = pc² / (γm₀c²) = (γm₀v)c² / (γm₀c²) = v\n*   Therefore, the relationship is simply **dE/dp = v**. This means the rate of change of energy with respect to momentum is the particle's velocity. This result holds for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases.\n*   So, our approximation becomes:\n    **ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp**\n\n**4. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n\n*   Now we can combine the results from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   **Formula:**\n    ΔE = v ⋅ Δp\n*   **Substitute the values:**\n    *   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Δp ≈ 5.27 × 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s (from Step 2)\n*   **Calculation:**\n    ΔE ≈ (2 × 10⁸ m/s) × (5.27 × 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE ≈ 10.54 × 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**5. Compare the result with the given options.**\n\n*   Our calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n*   Let's look at the options:\n    A) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n    B) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n    C) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n    D) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n*   The calculated value is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that by first calculating the uncertainty in momentum from the uncertainty in position and then relating the uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in energy via the particle's velocity, we arrive at a value of approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<D>>>"
