    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Dienophile**\n\n*   The problem starts with a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene\" which is dehydrated to an anhydride. The ability to form a cyclic anhydride implies the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same side of the molecule. A cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid like maleic acid fits this description perfectly.\n*   The anhydride's NMR data is provided:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The peak at ~165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and the peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon.\n*   This data points unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (one ¹³C signal) and the two alkene carbons equivalent (a second ¹³C signal).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Diene**\n\n*   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups attached to the sp² hybridized carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₉H₁₄ from the diene + C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the **endo** product and the **exo** product.\n    *   In the **endo** product, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is tucked under the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the diene's original π-system (which becomes the double bond in the product). The endo product is usually the kinetically favored, **major product**.\n    *   In the **exo** product, the anhydride ring points away from the double bond. The exo product is usually the thermodynamically favored, **minor product**.\n*   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the endo and exo isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Structures and Proton Environments**\n\n*   Let's analyze the protons in the product structure (a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative):\n    1.  **Alkene Methyl Protons:** Two methyl groups are attached to the C=C double bond. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. They will appear as a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.6-1.8 ppm.\n    2.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** Two methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons (saturated sp³ carbons). They are also equivalent due to symmetry and will appear as a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.2 ppm.\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons:** These are the two protons that originated from the maleic anhydride. They are attached to carbons that are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a 2H singlet (coupling to the bridgehead protons is often negligible due to a ~90° dihedral angle). Their chemical shift will be relatively high due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyls, around 3.5 ppm.\n    4.  **Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7) are generally not equivalent and would couple to each other, often appearing as a complex multiplet or two doublets. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.5 ppm.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially-proximate protons.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial interaction that exists in the endo isomer but not in the exo isomer.\n*   Let's compare the spatial arrangement in the two isomers:\n    *   **Endo (Major) Isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked *under* the C=C double bond. This brings the **anhydride protons** very close to the **alkene methyl protons**.\n    *   **Exo (Minor) Isomer:** The anhydride ring points *away* from the C=C double bond. The anhydride protons are far from the alkene methyl protons.\n*   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must be between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl protons**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Interacting Protons to the NMR Signals**\n\n*   Based on our chemical shift analysis in Step 4:\n    *   The **alkene methyl protons** correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   The **anhydride protons** correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects these two signals.\n\n**Step 7: Select the Correct Answer**\n\n*   We are looking for the option that connects a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm with a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n*   Option A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). Incorrect.\n*   Option B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (alkene methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). **This is the correct answer.**\n*   Option C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This interaction would be stronger in the exo (minor) product. Incorrect.\n*   Option D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (alkene methyls). These groups are not close enough for a strong NOE. Incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>"
