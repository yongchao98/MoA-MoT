    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Mott-Gurney Equation**\nThe equation given is $J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$. This equation describes the current density (J) as a function of voltage (V) in a specific regime of semiconductor device operation. The key characteristics to note from the equation are:\n*   The current is proportional to the square of the voltage ($J \\propto V^2$). This is a non-linear, non-Ohmic behavior.\n*   The current depends on material properties like dielectric constant ($\\epsilon$) and carrier mobility ($\\mu$), and the device dimension (L).\n*   This specific relationship is known as the Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC) law for a trap-free insulator.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Physical Assumptions behind the Mott-Gurney Law**\nThe derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation relies on a set of simplifying assumptions about the device and the charge transport process. Let's list the crucial points:\n\n1.  **Single-Carrier Transport:** The model assumes that the current is carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). The contribution from the other carrier type is considered negligible. This is often the case in materials where one carrier has significantly higher mobility or is preferentially injected.\n2.  **Trap-Free Material:** The derivation assumes an ideal insulator or semiconductor with no electronic trap states within its bandgap. If traps were present, they would capture some of the injected carriers, reducing the number of free carriers available for conduction and altering the J-V relationship.\n3.  **Ohmic Contact / No Injection Barrier:** The model requires that one of the electrical contacts (the injecting contact) can supply an unlimited number of charge carriers into the device as the voltage is applied. This is known as an \"Ohmic contact\" for that carrier type. It means there is no energy barrier for carriers to be injected from the electrode into the semiconductor. This ensures that the current is limited by the transport properties of the bulk material (the \"space charge\") rather than by the injection process at the contact.\n4.  **Drift-Dominated Current:** The model assumes that the primary mechanism for charge transport is the drift of carriers in the electric field. The current component arising from the diffusion of carriers (due to concentration gradients) is assumed to be negligible. This is a valid approximation for devices that are not extremely thin and are operated at sufficiently high voltages.\n5.  **Negligible Intrinsic Carriers:** The concentration of carriers injected from the contact is assumed to be much greater than the concentration of thermally generated (intrinsic) carriers in the material.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Statement Against the Assumptions**\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The statement specifies a \"two-carrier device\".\n    *   **Analysis:** This contradicts the fundamental assumption of single-carrier transport. The presence of two carriers would introduce recombination, which is not accounted for in the simple Mott-Gurney model. Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The statement specifies \"negligible drift current\".\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the opposite of the core assumption. The Mott-Gurney law describes a current that is dominated by drift. It is the diffusion current that is neglected, not the drift current. Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This statement combines several conditions.\n    *   **Analysis:**\n        *   \"trap-free\": This matches assumption #2.\n        *   \"single-carrier device\": This matches assumption #1.\n        *   \"no carrier injection barrier\": This is a precise way of stating the Ohmic contact condition (assumption #3).\n        *   \"negligible diffusion current\": This matches assumption #4.\n    *   This statement accurately and comprehensively lists the key conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation. Therefore, this statement is **true**.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The statement specifies a \"Schottky contact\".\n    *   **Analysis:** A Schottky contact, by definition, forms an energy barrier for charge injection. This would limit the current based on the injection process (e.g., thermionic emission over the barrier), leading to an \"injection-limited current\" rather than a \"space-charge-limited current\". This violates assumption #3. Therefore, this statement is **false**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, statement C is the only one that correctly describes all the necessary conditions for the Mott-Gurney law to be valid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
