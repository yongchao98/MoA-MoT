    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to completely dissolve 0.1 g of solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, by adding a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid (like HCl). The final volume of the solution will be 100 cm³. We need to find the minimum volume of acid required and the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n        *   Atomic mass of Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n        *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n        *   Atomic mass of H ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 55.85 + 3 * (17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.\n    *   Now, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ from the given mass.\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n3.  **Write the Chemical Reaction:**\n    *   The strong acid provides H⁺ ions, which react with the hydroxide (OH⁻) from Fe(OH)₃ in a neutralization reaction.\n    *   The balanced chemical equation for the dissolution is:\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Needed for the Reaction:**\n    *   From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   This is the amount of H⁺ needed just to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n\n5.  **Consider the Final Solution:**\n    *   After the reaction, the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution contains the dissolved Fe³⁺ ions.\n    *   To keep the Fe³⁺ ions in solution and prevent Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating, the solution must be acidic. This means there must be some excess H⁺ ions remaining after the neutralization reaction.\n    *   The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must be equal to the moles that reacted plus the moles that remain in excess.\n        *   Total H⁺ added = H⁺ (reacted) + H⁺ (excess)\n\n6.  **Test the Options for Internal Consistency:**\n    *   The problem is a multiple-choice question, and the correct option must be self-consistent. We can test each option to see if the given volume of acid results in the given pH.\n    *   Let V_acid be the volume of acid in cm³.\n    *   Total moles H⁺ added = Concentration * Volume = 0.1 mol/L * (V_acid / 1000) L\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = (Total H⁺ added) - (H⁺ reacted)\n    *   Final [H⁺] = Moles H⁺ (excess) / Final Volume = Moles H⁺ (excess) / 0.1 L\n    *   Final pH = -log([H⁺])\n\n    Let's check **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n    *   **Volume of acid (V_acid):** 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   **Total moles H⁺ added:** 0.1 mol/L * 0.03009 L = 0.003009 mol.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (reacted):** We calculated this in Step 4 as 0.002807 mol.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (excess):** 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000202 mol.\n    *   **Final [H⁺]:** 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n    *   **Calculate the resulting pH:** pH = -log(0.00202) ≈ 2.6947.\n\n    This calculated pH of ~2.69 matches the pH given in Option B. Let's quickly check another option to be sure.\n\n    Let's check **Option C: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n\n    *   **Volume of acid (V_acid):** 32.14 cm³ = 0.03214 L\n    *   **Total moles H⁺ added:** 0.1 mol/L * 0.03214 L = 0.003214 mol.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ (excess):** 0.003214 mol - 0.002807 mol = 0.000407 mol.\n    *   **Final [H⁺]:** 0.000407 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00407 M.\n    *   **Calculate the resulting pH:** pH = -log(0.00407) ≈ 2.39.\n    *   This calculated pH (2.39) does not match the given pH (3.16). Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n    Options A and D provide insufficient acid to even dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ completely, as the moles of H⁺ added would be less than the 0.002807 moles required for the reaction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only option where the volume of acid and the final pH are consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction is Option B. The \"minimum volume\" condition is met because this is the point where the solution is just saturated, which corresponds to the calculated pH.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation Check:\n*   Acid added: 30.09 cm³ of 0.1 M H⁺.\n*   Moles H⁺ added: 0.003009 mol.\n*   Moles H⁺ to dissolve Fe(OH)₃: 0.002807 mol.\n*   Excess H⁺: 0.003009 - 0.002807 = 0.000202 mol.\n*   Final [H⁺] in 100 cm³: 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n*   Final pH: -log(0.00202) = 2.69.\nThe values are consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>"
