    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the starting material.**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n*   **Principal functional group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH). This is at position 1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is at position 5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   On the ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H₂). Total = 7 H.\n    *   In the -COOH group: 1 H.\n    *   In the -CHO group: 1 H.\n    *   In the -CH=CH₂ group: 3 H.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the -CHO group.\n    *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Calculate the IHD of the starting material for verification.**\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2). (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\nIHD (start) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis IHD of 5 can be accounted for by:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. This confirms our structure is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and determine the structure of the product.**\n\nThe reagent is **Red Phosphorus and excess of HI**.\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   **Effect on functional groups:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The vinyl group's double bond (-CH=CH₂) will be saturated to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be saturated to a single bond, converting the ring to a cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Product Structure:**\nThe product will be a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:\n*   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position 1.\n*   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position 2.\n*   An ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃) at position 5.\nThe product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The reaction leads to a fully saturated hydrocarbon, except for the ring.**\nThe term \"excess HI\" implies that the reaction goes to completion, reducing all possible sites. The cyclic structure of the alkane remains intact.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.**\n\nThe product is a substituted cycloalkane.\n*   **Carbon (C):** The number of carbon atoms is conserved. C = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for such compounds is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   For n = 10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the final product.**\n\nUsing the molecular formula of the product, C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\n**Careful Point 3: The meaning of IHD.**\nThe IHD of 1 signifies the presence of one ring in the molecule. Since the product is a substituted cyclohexane, which has one ring and no double or triple bonds, an IHD of 1 is the expected value.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n1.  The starting material is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n2.  The reaction with Red P / excess HI reduces all C=C, C=O bonds and removes all oxygen atoms, converting the molecule into a saturated cycloalkane.\n3.  The product is a substituted cyclohexane with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀.\n4.  The IHD of a molecule with the formula C₁₀H₂₀ is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
