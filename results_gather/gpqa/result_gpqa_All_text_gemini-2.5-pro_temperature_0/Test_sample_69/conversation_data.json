    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the clues provided.**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** solid A + 8 gas B → bright red product C\n*   **Clue 2:** C + 2 gas D → extremely hazardous product E\n*   **Clue 3:** C + H₂O → solid A + strong acid F + weak acid G\n*   **Clue 4:** gas D + gas B → solvent H (in a 1:1 ratio)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the most restrictive clue.**\n\nClue 3 is the most chemically specific and restrictive clue. The hydrolysis of C regenerates the starting material A and produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). This suggests that the ligands in C (which come from gas B) undergo hydrolysis or disproportionation. The regeneration of A suggests it is a relatively noble element that is resistant to oxidation by water or the acids formed.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis based on Clue 3.**\n\nWe need to find a substance (derived from gas B) that hydrolyzes to produce a strong acid and a weak acid.\n*   Let's consider interhalogens. The gas Bromine monochloride (BrCl) hydrolyzes in water:\n    BrCl + H₂O → HCl + HOBr\n*   In this reaction, Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid (F), and Hypobromous acid (HOBr) is a weak acid (G). This is a perfect fit for the products described in Clue 3.\n*   Therefore, we can hypothesize:\n    *   **B = BrCl** (Bromine monochloride, a reddish-brown gas)\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   **G = HOBr** (Hypobromous acid)\n\n**Step 4: Use the hypothesis to identify other substances.**\n\n*   **Identify A and C (Clue 1 & 3):**\n    *   Since C hydrolyzes to regenerate A, A is likely a noble metal that can be reduced back to its elemental form from a complex. Gold (Au) is a good candidate.\n    *   A = **Au** (Gold, a solid).\n    *   Gold reacts with halogens to form colored complexes. Gold(III) halides like AuCl₃ and AuBr₃ are red. So, C is a red gold(III) bromo-chloro complex.\n    *   C = **Au₂(Br,Cl)₆** (a simplified representation of a red gold halide complex).\n    *   The 1:8 stoichiometry in Clue 1 is a known difficulty in this classic puzzle and is likely a simplification.\n\n*   **Identify D and H (Clue 4):**\n    *   We have D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   With B = BrCl, we have D(g) + BrCl(g) → H(solvent).\n    *   Let's test a plausible gas for D. If D is Carbon Monoxide (CO), the reaction is:\n        CO + BrCl → BrCOCl (Carbonyl bromochloride)\n    *   BrCOCl is a liquid and can be used as a solvent. This reaction fits the 1:1 stoichiometry.\n    *   So, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **D = CO** (Carbon Monoxide)\n        *   **H = BrCOCl** (Carbonyl bromochloride)\n\n**Step 5: Identify the extremely hazardous product E (Clue 2).**\n\n*   We have C + 2D → E.\n*   Substituting our identified substances: Gold halide complex (C) + 2CO (D) → E.\n*   There is a known reaction where gold(III) chloride oxidizes carbon monoxide to phosgene:\n    Au₂Cl₆ + 2CO → Au₂Cl₄ + 2COCl₂\n*   This reaction produces Phosgene (COCl₂), which is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. The stoichiometry also matches.\n*   Therefore, we can confidently identify E:\n    *   **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n**Step 6: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   The molecule E is phosgene, COCl₂.\n*   Let's analyze its structure and symmetry elements:\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It has one two-fold rotation axis (C₂) that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two mirror planes (σᵥ). One plane is the plane of the molecule itself. The other is perpendicular to the molecular plane and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n*   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the identification of E as phosgene (COCl₂), which has a molecular symmetry of C₂ᵥ. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
