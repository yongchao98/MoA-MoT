    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n\nWe need to consider two different inertial frames of reference:\n*   **S' (The Rest Frame of the Glass):** In this frame, the glass is stationary. An observer in this frame would be moving along with the glass.\n*   **S (The Laboratory Frame):** In this frame, the laboratory and the observer are stationary. The glass is observed to be moving with a constant velocity `v`.\n\n**2. Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S')**\n\n*   The definition of the index of refraction `n` of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`).\n*   So, `n = c / u'`.\n*   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of the light beam within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame (S'), is `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n*   This velocity `u'` is in the same direction as the motion of the glass.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\n*   We need to find the speed of the light beam (`u`) as measured in the laboratory frame (S). To do this, we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, as the speeds involved can be close to the speed of light. The classical Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`) is not accurate.\n*   The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the laboratory frame (S). This is what we want to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame (S', the glass).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S', the glass) relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\n\n*   We have `u' = 1/n`.\n*   We have the velocity of the glass `v`.\n*   We have the speed of light in vacuum `c = 1`.\n\nSubstituting these into the velocity addition formula:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n\n*   First, simplify the denominator:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n*   To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = 1/n + nv/n = (1 + nv) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = n/n + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n*   Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ( (1 + nv) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n*   The `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n    `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) 1\nB) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nC) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nD) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\nOur result matches option B.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Choice of Formula:** It is crucial to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, not the classical one. The problem involves the speed of light, which is the domain of special relativity.\n*   **Frame Identification:** Correctly identifying which speed belongs to which frame of reference (`u'` in the glass's frame, `v` for the glass's motion, `u` in the lab frame) is the key to setting up the problem correctly.\n*   **Sign Convention:** Since the light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction, both `u'` and `v` are positive. If they were moving in opposite directions, one would be negative.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** Be careful when simplifying the complex fraction to arrive at the final form. Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the main fraction by `n` is an efficient way to simplify.\n\n<<<B>>>"
