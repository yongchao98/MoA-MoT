    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\nb) The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1: $v_1 = 0.6c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2: $v_2 = 0.5c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Part A: Calculating the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (relativistic), we cannot simply subtract the velocities ($0.6c - 0.5c$). We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative velocity.\n\n*   **Formula:** The relative velocity of object 2 as seen from object 1's reference frame ($v_{21}$) is given by:\n    $v_{21} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute the given values into the formula:\n        $v_{21} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n    2.  Simplify the numerator and the denominator:\n        $v_{21} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - (0.6)(0.5)}$\n        $v_{21} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n        $v_{21} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7}$\n    3.  Calculate the final value:\n        $v_{21} = -\\frac{1}{7}c \\approx -0.1428c$\n    4.  The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) is the magnitude of this velocity.\n        $v_{rel} = |v_{21}| \\approx 0.1428c$\n    5.  Rounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} = 0.14c$.\n\n**Part B: Calculating the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is not just its kinetic energy or its rest energy ($mc^2$), but the sum of both. The formula for the total energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the individual astronauts.\n\n*   **Formula:**\n    *   Total energy of a particle: $E = \\gamma mc^2$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Total energy of the system: $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 ($\\gamma_1$):\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_1/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    2.  Calculate the total energy of astronaut 1 ($E_1$):\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25) \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 ($\\gamma_2$):\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_2/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    2.  Calculate the total energy of astronaut 2 ($E_2$):\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}}mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Total System Energy:**\n    1.  Sum the individual energies:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    2.  $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n    3.  Rounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} = 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe calculated relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\nThe calculated total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\nThese results match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
