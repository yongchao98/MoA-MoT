    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the minimum energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n*   The system consists of 13 identical particles.\n*   Each particle has a charge `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge.\n*   One particle is fixed at a central point P.\n*   The other 12 particles are constrained to move on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m`, centered at P.\n*   The goal is to find the minimum total electrostatic potential energy of this entire 13-particle system.\n\n**2. Decompose the Total Potential Energy**\nThe total potential energy (`U_total`) of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all possible pairs of charges. We can group these interactions into two categories:\n*   **`U_center-sphere`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n*   **`U_sphere-sphere`**: The potential energy from the mutual interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nSo, the total energy is `U_total = U_center-sphere + U_sphere-sphere`.\n\n**3. Analyze `U_center-sphere`**\n*   The central charge is `q`.\n*   Each of the 12 charges on the sphere is also `q`.\n*   The distance between the central charge and any of the 12 sphere charges is always the radius `R`.\n*   The potential energy between two point charges `q1` and `q2` separated by a distance `r` is `k * q1 * q2 / r`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant.\n*   The energy for one pair (center charge and one sphere charge) is `k * q * q / R = k * q^2 / R`.\n*   Since there are 12 such charges on the sphere, the total energy for this part is:\n    `U_center-sphere = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n*   **Careful Point:** This part of the energy is constant regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere, because their distance to the center is fixed at `R`.\n\n**4. Analyze `U_sphere-sphere` (The Minimum Energy Configuration)**\n*   This part of the energy depends on the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere's surface.\n*   Since all charges are identical and positive, they repel each other. To achieve a state of minimum potential energy, they will arrange themselves to be as far apart from each other as possible.\n*   This is a famous problem in physics known as the **Thomson problem**. For 12 charges, the proven minimum energy configuration is when the charges are located at the vertices of a **regular icosahedron** inscribed within the sphere.\n*   The potential energy for this configuration can be expressed as `U_sphere-sphere = E_12 * (k * q^2 / R)`, where `E_12` is a dimensionless constant that depends on the geometry of the icosahedron.\n*   The value for `E_12` has been calculated and is a known constant: `E_12 ≈ 49.165335`.\n\n**5. Combine the Energies to Find the Total Minimum Energy**\nNow we can write the expression for the total minimum energy of the system:\n`U_total_min = U_center-sphere + U_sphere-sphere_min`\n`U_total_min = 12 * (k * q^2 / R) + E_12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n`U_total_min = (12 + E_12) * (k * q^2 / R)`\nSubstituting the value of `E_12`:\n`U_total_min = (12 + 49.165335) * (k * q^2 / R)`\n`U_total_min = 61.165335 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n**6. Substitute Values and Calculate**\nNow, we plug in the given values and physical constants:\n*   Coulomb's constant, `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`\n*   Elementary charge, `e ≈ 1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e = 2 * 1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹ C ≈ 3.204354 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   Radius of the sphere, `R = 2 m`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term `(k * q^2 / R)`:\n*   `q^2 = (3.204354 × 10⁻¹⁹ C)² ≈ 1.026788 × 10⁻³⁷ C²`\n*   `k * q^2 = (8.98755 × 10^9) * (1.026788 × 10⁻³⁷) ≈ 9.2286 × 10⁻²⁸ J⋅m`\n*   `(k * q^2 / R) = (9.2286 × 10⁻²⁸ J⋅m) / 2 m ≈ 4.6143 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n\nFinally, calculate the total minimum energy:\n*   `U_total_min = 61.165335 * (4.6143 × 10⁻²⁸ J)`\n*   `U_total_min ≈ 282.215 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n*   `U_total_min ≈ 2.82215 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\n**7. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated minimum energy is approximately `2.822 × 10⁻²⁶ J`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 7.056 x 10⁻²⁷ J\nB) 5.645 x 10⁻²⁶ J\nC) 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J\nD) 122.330 J\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
