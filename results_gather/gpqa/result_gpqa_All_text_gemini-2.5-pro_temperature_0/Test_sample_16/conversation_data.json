    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\n*   The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as CaY²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ is the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand).\n*   This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n*   The formation reaction is: Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻. The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, Kf, given as KCa-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n*   Since we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, we need to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\n\n*   The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (Kd) is the inverse of the formation constant (Kf).\n*   Kd = 1 / Kf\n*   Kd = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 0.2 x 10⁻¹⁰ = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**3. Set up an ICE Table**\n\n*   An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table helps track the concentrations of the species involved in the reaction. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n*   **Reaction:**      CaY²⁻   ⇌   Ca²⁺   +   Y⁴⁻\n*   **Initial (I):**    0.02 M        0 M        0 M\n    *   We start with 0.02 M of the stoichiometric complex and assume no free ions are present initially.\n*   **Change (C):**      -x           +x         +x\n    *   For every mole of CaY²⁻ that dissociates, one mole of Ca²⁺ and one mole of Y⁴⁻ are formed.\n*   **Equilibrium (E):** (0.02 - x) M    x M        x M\n    *   The equilibrium concentrations are the sum of the initial and change rows.\n\n**4. Write and Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\n\n*   The equilibrium expression for the dissociation reaction is:\n    Kd = [Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻] / [CaY²⁻]\n*   Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into this expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The formation constant (Kf) is very large, which means the dissociation constant (Kd) is very small. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n*   We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the math significantly.\n*   The simplified equation becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**6. Calculate the Value of x**\n\n*   Rearrange the equation to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n*   Now, take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)  *(This is a useful trick to get an even exponent)*\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**7. Final Answer**\n\n*   From the ICE table, the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n*   Therefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n*   This result matches option A.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n*   **Reaction Direction:** Be sure to use the dissociation reaction (CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻) since you are starting with the complex.\n*   **Equilibrium Constant:** Use the dissociation constant (Kd = 1/Kf), not the formation constant (Kf), for the dissociation reaction.\n*   **Approximation:** The approximation (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) is valid because Kd is very small, but it's good practice to mentally check if the calculated 'x' is indeed much smaller than 0.02 (6.3x10⁻⁷ is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation is valid).\n*   **Ideal pH:** The problem states \"ideal pH,\" which allows us to use the given K value directly without needing to account for the protonation of the free EDTA ligand (i.e., we assume all free EDTA is in the Y⁴⁻ form).\n\n<<<A>>>"
