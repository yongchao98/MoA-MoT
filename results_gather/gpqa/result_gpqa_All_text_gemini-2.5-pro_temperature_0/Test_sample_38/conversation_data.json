    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the value of \"a\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Principle: Normalization**\n\nThe fundamental principle we need to use is the **normalization of the wave function**. In quantum mechanics, the wave function `ψ(x)` contains all the information about a particle. The probability of finding the particle in a small interval `dx` around a position `x` is given by `|ψ(x)|² dx`.\n\nThe total probability of finding the particle *somewhere* in the space where it can exist must be equal to 1 (or 100%). This is expressed mathematically by the normalization condition:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nThe integral is taken over all space where the particle can be found.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information and Define the Terms**\n\n*   **Wave Function (ψ):** `ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i`\n*   **Region of Existence:** The problem states that particles were only found between `x=1` and `x=3`. This means the probability of finding the particle is zero outside this interval. Therefore, our integral for normalization will be from 1 to 3.\n*   **Unknown:** The numerical value of the constant \"a\".\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability Density, |ψ(x)|²**\n\nThe probability density is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, which is calculated as `ψ*(x)ψ(x)`, where `ψ*(x)` is the complex conjugate of `ψ(x)`.\n\n*   **Find the complex conjugate, ψ*(x):** To find the complex conjugate, we change the sign of the imaginary part (the term with `i`).\n    `ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i`\n\n*   **Multiply ψ*(x) by ψ(x):**\n    `|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x)ψ(x)`\n    `|ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]`\n\n    This multiplication is in the form `(A + B)(A - B) = A² - B²`, where `A = a / sqrt(1 + x)` and `B = 0.5*i`.\n    `|ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5*i)²`\n    `|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)`\n\n    Since `i² = -1`:\n    `|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)`\n    `|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n\n**4. Set Up and Solve the Normalization Integral**\n\nNow we apply the normalization condition using the calculated probability density and the given limits of integration (from x=1 to x=3).\n\n∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts for easier calculation:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **Solve the first integral:**\n    `∫ ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx = a² * ∫ ( 1 / (1 + x) ) dx`\n    The antiderivative of `1 / (1 + x)` is `ln(1 + x)`.\n    `a² * [ ln(1 + x) ]` evaluated from 1 to 3.\n    `a² * [ ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) ]`\n    `a² * [ ln(4) - ln(2) ]`\n    Using the logarithm rule `ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B)`:\n    `a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)`\n\n*   **Solve the second integral:**\n    `∫ 0.25 dx = [ 0.25x ]` evaluated from 1 to 3.\n    `0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1 = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5`\n\n**5. Solve for \"a\"**\n\nNow, substitute the results back into the main equation:\n`a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n\nIsolate the term with `a²`:\n`a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5`\n`a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n\nSolve for `a²`:\n`a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n\nUsing the approximate value `ln(2) ≈ 0.693`:\n`a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693`\n`a² ≈ 0.7215`\n\nFinally, take the square root to find `a` (we take the positive root as is conventional and matches the options):\n`a = sqrt(0.7215)`\n`a ≈ 0.8494`\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated value `a ≈ 0.8494` is extremely close to the option **0.85**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The number of systems (10,000):** This information is irrelevant for calculating the normalization constant \"a\". The normalization condition applies to the wave function of a single particle. The large number simply reinforces that the experimental observation (particles only between x=1 and x=3) is statistically significant and reflects the true probability distribution.\n*   **Complex Numbers:** It is crucial to correctly calculate the probability density `|ψ|²` as `ψ*ψ`. A common mistake is to simply square `ψ`, which is incorrect for complex functions.\n*   **Limits of Integration:** The problem explicitly defines the domain where the particle exists (`1 < x < 3`). This is a critical piece of information that defines the bounds of the normalization integral. Without it, the problem would be unsolvable.\n*   **Calculus:** Ensure the integration of `1/(1+x)` to `ln(1+x)` and the subsequent evaluation using logarithm rules are done correctly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
