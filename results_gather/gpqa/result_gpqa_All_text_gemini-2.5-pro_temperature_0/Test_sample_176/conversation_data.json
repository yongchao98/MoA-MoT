    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the governing physical laws**\n\nThe problem involves the luminosity, radius, and temperature of stars, which are treated as black bodies. The key physical laws are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). This law applies to the radiation as it is emitted by the star (in its rest frame). The formula is:\n    λ_max_rest * T = b\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n3.  **Doppler Effect for Light:** This effect describes the change in the observed wavelength of light due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For a source moving with a radial velocity 'v' (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the rest-frame emitted wavelength (λ_rest) by:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n    (This is the non-relativistic approximation, which is valid here since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light, c).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the luminosity ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂).\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ = 4πR₁²σT₁⁴\nL₂ = 4πR₂²σT₂⁴\n\nThe ratio is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**Step 3: Determine the radius ratio (R₁/R₂)**\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, the radius ratio is:\nR₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\n**Step 4: Determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. We need to relate the temperatures using the information about their peak wavelengths and velocities.\n*   The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs). So, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.\n*   We use the Doppler formula to relate the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength for each star.\n    *   For Star_1: v₁ = 0 km/s. So, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest1.\n    *   For Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s. So, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n*   Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Now, we use Wien's Law, which connects temperature to the *rest-frame* wavelength:\n    T₁ = b / λ_rest1\n    T₂ = b / λ_rest2\n*   The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    T₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_rest1) / (b / λ_rest2) = λ_rest2 / λ_rest1\n*   Substitute the relationship we found from the Doppler effect:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest2 / [λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c)] = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The mass information (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation, which is based on black body radiation principles.\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the *observed* peak wavelength and the *rest-frame* peak wavelength. Wien's Law applies to the rest-frame wavelength, while the observation is of the Doppler-shifted wavelength. The radial velocity information is essential to connect the two.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final luminosity ratio**\n\nNow we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n*   (1.5)² = 2.25\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 700,000 / 299,792,458)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.00233495)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / 1.00233495]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (0.9976706)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99072\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.22912\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
