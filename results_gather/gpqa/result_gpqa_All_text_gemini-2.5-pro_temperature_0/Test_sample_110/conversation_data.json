    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone that can be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The combination of a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and a base indicates a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The α-carbons of the ketone are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group) and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. The base removes the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate. This enolate is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate attacks the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate). The nucleophilic carbon is C6 of the enolate.\n    *   The attack occurs at the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group), which is the electrophilic site in a conjugate addition.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product A):**\n    *   After the addition and subsequent protonation (workup), the new substituent, a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group (an ethyl propanoate group), is attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   The resulting molecule is `6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`.\n    *   The options provide names where the product is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. We must name the cyclohexanone part as a substituent.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`. The cyclohexyl ring is the substituent at position 3.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (C1'). This was C6 in the original ketone.\n    *   The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1' of the substituent name.\n    *   The carbonyl group (oxo) was at C1 of the ketone, which is adjacent to C6. So, the oxo group is at C2' in the new numbering.\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups were at C2 of the ketone, which is adjacent to the carbonyl C1. So, these groups are at C3' in the new numbering.\n    *   The substituents on the cyclohexyl ring are: a methyl at C1', an oxo at C2', and an ethyl and a methyl at C3'.\n    *   Alphabetizing and numbering gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN), also known as crotononitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`), which is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product B):**\n    *   After the addition and protonation by water, the final product is formed by connecting the two fragments:\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
