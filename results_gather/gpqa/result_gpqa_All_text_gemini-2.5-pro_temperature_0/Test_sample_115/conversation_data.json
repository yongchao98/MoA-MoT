    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A from its ¹H NMR spectrum.**\n*   The spectrum shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).\n*   A triplet for 6H suggests two equivalent methyl groups (2 x -CH₃), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   A quartet for 4H suggests two equivalent methylene groups (2 x -CH₂-), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n*   Putting these together, we have two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The chemical shifts (0.9 and 1.3 ppm) are characteristic of a simple alkane.\n*   The simplest symmetrical alkane with two ethyl groups is butane (CH₃CH₂-CH₂CH₃).\n*   Let's check the expected NMR for butane:\n    *   The two -CH₃ groups (6H) are equivalent and adjacent to a -CH₂- group, so they would appear as a triplet. This matches.\n    *   The two -CH₂- groups (4H) are equivalent and adjacent to a -CH₃ group (3H) and another -CH₂- group (2H). The total number of neighboring protons is 5. According to the n+1 rule, this signal should be a sextet.\n*   **Careful Point:** The problem states the 4H signal is a quartet, not a sextet. This is a common simplification or error in textbook problems. Given the subsequent reaction sequence, it is most logical to assume that Compound A is butane and the splitting pattern was described incorrectly. Other possibilities (like diethyl ether or diethyl ketone) are ruled out by the chemical shifts, which are too low (upfield).\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** Compound A is butane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B and Compound C.**\n*   Compound A (butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. Radical bromination of butane can occur at C1 or C2. Bromination is more selective for the secondary position (C2).\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃ + Br₂ → CH₃CH(Br)CH₂CH₃ (2-bromobutane) + CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂Br (1-bromobutane)\n    *   2-bromobutane will be the major product.\n*   Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form Compound C. This is a dehydrohalogenation (E2 elimination) reaction.\n*   If B is 2-bromobutane, elimination can form two products:\n    *   Elimination of H from C1 (Hofmann product): but-1-ene (CH₂=CHCH₂CH₃)\n    *   Elimination of H from C3 (Zaitsev product): but-2-ene (CH₃CH=CHCH₃)\n*   The problem states that \"C has two geometrical isomers\".\n    *   But-1-ene does not have geometrical isomers.\n    *   But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: cis-but-2-ene and trans-but-2-ene.\n*   **Careful Point:** This confirms that the elimination produces but-2-ene, which is the major product according to Zaitsev's rule.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2:** Compound C is but-2-ene.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound D from the Diels-Alder reaction.**\n*   The reaction is between the **cis-isomer of C** and **(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol**.\n*   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, or Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Dienophile:** cis-but-2-ene ((Z)-but-2-ene).\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n*   The product, D, will be a substituted cyclohexene. The substituents are an -OH group and three -CH₃ groups. The name is 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. This matches the names in options B and D.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the stereochemistry of Compound D.**\n*   The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the reactants and the rules of the Diels-Alder reaction.\n    1.  **Stereochemistry from the dienophile:** The dienophile is cis-but-2-ene. The reaction is a syn-addition, so the two methyl groups (at C5 and C6 of the product) will be cis to each other. This eliminates option D, where the C5 and C6 stereocenters (5S, 6R) imply a trans relationship between these methyl groups.\n    2.  **Stereochemistry from the diene:** The diene is (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. In an acyclic (E,E)-diene, the two terminal substituents (-OH on C1 and -CH₃ on C4) are trans in the required s-cis conformation and will end up trans to each other in the product.\n    3.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity:** The Diels-Alder reaction generally favors the endo product due to secondary orbital overlap. In the endo transition state, the substituents on the diene that are \"inside\" the C-shape of the s-cis conformation end up on the same face as the dienophile's substituents. For our diene, the C4-methyl group is \"inside\". Therefore, the C4-methyl group will be cis to the two methyl groups from the dienophile.\n*   **Summary of Relative Stereochemistry (Endo Product):**\n    *   The -OH group at C1 is **trans** to the -CH₃ group at C4.\n    *   The -CH₃ group at C5 is **cis** to the -CH₃ group at C6.\n    *   The -CH₃ group at C4 is **cis** to the methyl groups at C5 and C6.\n    *   Combining these, all three methyl groups (at C4, C5, and C6) are cis to each other, and the -OH group at C1 is trans to this block of three methyl groups.\n*   **Matching with Options:**\n    *   Let's check the relative stereochemistry of option B: (1S,4R,5S,6S).\n        *   1S and 4R are opposite, so C1-OH and C4-CH₃ are **trans**. (Matches)\n        *   4R and 5S are opposite, but this doesn't directly mean cis/trans without drawing. Let's check all three methyls.\n        *   The configuration (4R, 5S, 6S) corresponds to a relative arrangement where all three methyl groups are cis to each other.\n    *   Therefore, the relative stereochemistry of the predicted endo product perfectly matches the relative stereochemistry described in option B.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe reaction sequence leads to a product with the relative stereochemistry described in option B. The specific absolute stereochemistry (1S, 4R, 5S, 6S) represents one of the two possible enantiomers formed in the reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
