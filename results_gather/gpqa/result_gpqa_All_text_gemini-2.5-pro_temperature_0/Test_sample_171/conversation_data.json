    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the governing physical principle.**\nThe problem describes the population of atoms in different energy levels within the photospheres of stars. It explicitly mentions the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This situation is described by the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of two energy levels to the temperature of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Write down the Boltzmann Equation.**\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (level 1):\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the excited and lower states, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The problem does not provide the statistical weights (g₁ and g₂). In such cases, it is standard to assume that their ratio (g₂/g₁) is 1, or that it is the same for both stars and thus cancels out in the comparison. We will proceed with the assumption that g₂/g₁ = 1.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star.**\nLet R be the ratio of the population in the excited state to the population in the lower state (R = N₂/N₁).\n*   For star_1 with temperature T₁:\n    R₁ = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n*   For star_2 with temperature T₂:\n    R₂ = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n**Step 4: Use the relationship given in the problem.**\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means the ratio of populations for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2.\nR₁ = 2 * R₂\nSubstituting the expressions from Step 3:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n**Step 5: Solve the equation for the relationship between T₁ and T₂.**\nTo solve this exponential equation, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\nUsing the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(eˣ) = x:\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate the ln(2) term:\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T₂) - (1 / T₁) ]\n\nFind a common denominator for the terms in the brackets:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ / (T₁*T₂)) - (T₂ / (T₁*T₂)) ]\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The derived equation contains the term (ΔE / k). The options provided do not have this term. This implies that the value of this term must be 1. We must check this using the values given in the problem.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the value of the (ΔE / k) term.**\nThe problem gives:\n*   Energy difference, ΔE = 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nCalculate the ratio:\n(ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nThe numerical value of the pre-factor is exactly 1.\n\n**Step 7: Substitute the value back into the equation.**\nSubstitute (ΔE / k) = 1 into the equation from Step 5:\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\nln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n**Step 8: Compare the final result with the given options.**\nThe derived equation is ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]. This matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
