    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to identify the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). Its structure is C₆H₁₁-C≡CH.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break down this IUPAC name to determine the structure:\n    *   The parent molecule is \"cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\". This consists of a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (-CHO) attached to it.\n    *   The \"1-\" indicates that a substituent is located on carbon-1 of the cyclohexane ring. By convention, the carbon atom attached to the principal functional group (the aldehyde) is C1.\n    *   The substituent is \"(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)\". This is a methyl group (-CH₂-) that is substituted with both a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a cyclohexyl group (-C₆H₁₁). So, the substituent's structure is -CH(OH)C₆H₁₁.\n    *   Putting it all together, the final product has a cyclohexane ring where C1 is attached to both a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)C₆H₁₁ group.\n\n**2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\n*   The final product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is characteristic of an **aldol addition** product.\n*   The new C-C bond formed in the aldol reaction is between the α-carbon (relative to the carbonyl) of one molecule and the carbonyl carbon of another.\n*   Let's disconnect the target molecule at this bond. The bond is between C1 of the parent ring and the carbon bearing the -OH group.\n    *   The part that becomes the alcohol (-CH(OH)C₆H₁₁) came from an aldehyde (O=CHC₆H₁₁), which is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n    *   The part that provided the α-carbon (the C1 of the parent ring with the -CHO group) came from the enolate of another aldehyde, which is also **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n*   Therefore, the final step of the synthesis is the self-aldol addition of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, catalyzed by a base.\n    *   2 x (C₆H₁₁-CHO) --(Base)--> 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**3. Synthesizing the Intermediate: Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**\n\n*   The core of the problem is to find a reaction sequence that converts ethynylcyclohexane (C₆H₁₁-C≡CH) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁-CHO).\n*   A very effective way to synthesize aldehydes is by the **ozonolysis of an alkene** with a reductive workup.\n*   To get C₆H₁₁-CHO from an alkene, the alkene must have the structure C₆H₁₁-CH=CHR. Ozonolysis will cleave the double bond to yield C₆H₁₁-CHO and R-CHO.\n*   We can synthesize this alkene from our starting material, ethynylcyclohexane. This requires adding a group to the alkyne and then reducing it.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n**A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n*   **Step 1:** Ethynylcyclohexane (a terminal alkyne) is treated with NaNH₂ (a strong base) to form a sodium acetylide anion (C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻Na⁺). This nucleophile then reacts with methyl chloride (CH₃Cl) to form 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃). This is a successful alkylation.\n*   **Step 2:** The internal alkyne is treated with H₂/Pd-CaCO₃ (Lindlar's catalyst). This is a poisoned catalyst that performs a syn-addition of hydrogen, reducing the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene: (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (cis-C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃).\n*   **Step 3:** The alkene is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S), which is a reductive workup. This ozonolysis cleaves the double bond to produce two aldehydes: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (C₆H₁₁-CHO) and acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO). This step successfully creates our key intermediate.\n*   **Step 4:** The mixture of aldehydes is treated with Ba(OH)₂, a base. This catalyzes the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the desired final product. While other aldol products might form, this sequence is chemically valid for synthesizing the target molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the desired product.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Step 1:** NaNH₂ is a much stronger base than the methoxide ion. It will react irreversibly with methanol (CH₃OH), an acid, to form sodium methoxide and ammonia. It will not effectively deprotonate the alkyne for alkylation. This sequence fails at the first step.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n*   **Step 1:** This step is valid, forming 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n*   **Step 2:** H₂/Pd (unpoisoned palladium on carbon) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane: propylcyclohexane (C₆H₁₁-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Step 3 & 4:** The subsequent reagents (a base and alkyne hydration conditions) will not react with the saturated alkane. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Step 1:** This step is valid, forming 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Step 2:** Li/liq. NH₃ reduces the alkyne to a *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Step 3:** Ozonolysis is followed by a workup with water (H₂O), which is often oxidative (especially without a reducing agent like Zn or (CH₃)₂S). This would oxidize the resulting aldehydes to carboxylic acids: cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (C₆H₁₁-COOH) and propanoic acid (CH₃CH₂COOH). Aldehydes, not carboxylic acids, are needed for the aldol reaction. This step is incorrect for the desired synthesis.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly sequence A provides a correct and logical pathway from the starting material to the final product. It correctly synthesizes the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and then uses it in a self-aldol reaction to form the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>"
