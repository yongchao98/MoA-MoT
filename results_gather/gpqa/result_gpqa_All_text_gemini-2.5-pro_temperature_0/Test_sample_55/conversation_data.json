    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Process**\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs not in a single step, but via a two-step process involving two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules**\nFor an electric dipole transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. Since this is a decay process (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the transition.\n\n*   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n_i = n' - 3 < 0$, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Final state: $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This requires $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This requires $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is also consistent.\n    *   $\\Delta n = n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, so $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions for the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   From the first step: $n'<3$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   From the second step: $n'>1$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The only integer value for $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$ is $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nThis means there are three possible routes for the two-step decay:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This probability is the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability that the atom, starting in $|3,0,0\\rangle$, will decay into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe probability of a transition to a specific state is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle \\text{final} | \\vec{d} | \\text{initial} \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator. The transition rate is proportional to $|\\langle n',l',m' | \\vec{r} | n,l,m \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe need to find the relative rates for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states:\n*   Rate to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $W_{-1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   Rate to $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $W_{0} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   Rate to $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $W_{+1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has orbital angular momentum $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. When a spherically symmetric system decays, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the decay populates each of the magnetic sublevels ($m'$) of the final state equally.\n\nTherefore, the transition rates to the states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal:\n$W_{-1} = W_{0} = W_{+1}$\n\nThe total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is $W_{total} = W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{+1} = 3W_{0}$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for the atom to take the path through the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{W_{0}}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_{0}}{W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{+1}} = \\frac{W_{0}}{3W_{0}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSimilarly, the probabilities for the paths through $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are also both $1/3$.\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Since this is the only allowed decay channel to the $n=1$ level, the probability of this second step is 1. Thus, the probability of the entire cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n**5. Match with the Options**\nWe are looking for an option that lists a valid route and the correct probability.\n*   A) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability: $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability: $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability: $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability: $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
