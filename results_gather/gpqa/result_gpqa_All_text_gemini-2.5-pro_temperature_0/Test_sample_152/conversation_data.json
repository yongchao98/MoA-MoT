    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate has acidic protons on the carbon between the two ester groups (α-protons). The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate carbanion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon double-bonded to the α-carbon and attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group. Its structure is `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons of the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and then the carbonyl π-electrons shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    *   The structure of the intermediate after the C-C bond formation is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH=C(O⁻)OCH₃`.\n\n3.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), to yield the final neutral product. The proton adds to the α-carbon.\n    *   The final product (A) has the structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product (A):**\n    *   The product is a tri-ester. We can name it as a substituted propane derivative. The main chain is the three-carbon chain connecting the ester groups.\n    *   Let's number the propane chain: `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-Tolyl)-CH₂(3)COOMe`. This numbering is not standard.\n    *   Let's use the IUPAC name provided in the options: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n    *   Let's verify this name. A propane backbone `C3-C2-C1`.\n        *   At C1, there are two methoxycarbonyl groups: `-CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n        *   At C2, there is a p-tolyl group: `-CH(p-Tolyl)-`.\n        *   At C3, there is one methoxycarbonyl group: `-CH₂COOCH₃`.\n    *   Connecting these gives: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂COOMe`. This matches the structure we derived.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n---\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Reactants:**\n    *   This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The β-carbon of the enamine (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is nucleophilic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. Its structure is `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. The β-carbon (the one attached to the methyl group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate containing an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   **Protonation:** The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Structure of the Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction starts with an equivalent of cyclohexanone (via the enamine) and adds a substituent at its α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent comes from but-2-enenitrile. The new bond is between C2 of the cyclohexane ring and the β-carbon of the nitrile. The fragment added is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this substituent at the 2-position.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product (B):**\n    *   The main functional group is the nitrile, so we name it as a substituted butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group, and it is attached to the C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product after acidic workup, not the enol form.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a \"find the reactant\" problem.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). Its structure is `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Conditions:** KOH, H₂O (basic).\n\n2.  **Analysis:**\n    *   A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of a donor and the β-carbon of an acceptor.\n    *   The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton and a `3-oxobutyl` side chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`).\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` side chain is derived from the Michael acceptor, MVK. The new bond is formed at the terminal `CH₂` (the β-carbon) of MVK.\n    *   This means the Michael donor must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part.\n    *   The protons on the carbon between the two carbonyls (C2) of a 1,3-dione are highly acidic. The base (KOH) will deprotonate this position to form a stable enolate.\n    *   This enolate then acts as the nucleophile, attacking MVK to form the observed product.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   Therefore, **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
