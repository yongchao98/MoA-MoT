    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic peak for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also have a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3300-3600 cm⁻¹) and is less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Specifically, a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid. This supports the conclusion from the O-H peak.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Careful Point:** The combination of a very broad O-H peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a C=O peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene (C=C) group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n**Careful Point:** This piece of data corroborates the FTIR evidence for a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45).\n\n**Careful Point:** This fragment provides strong, independent evidence for the presence of a -COOH group.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize All Data and Evaluate the Options**\n\n1.  **Functional Groups Identified:** The combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n2.  **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with options B (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. We can calculate it from the molecular formula using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. We can also determine the required DoU from the identified functional groups.\n    *   A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   An alkene (C=C) contains one C=C double bond, which accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of at least **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n4.  **Check DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **Option B (C6H12O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula only allows for one degree of unsaturation. It could be a carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) OR an alkene with two alcohol groups, but it cannot be both a carboxylic acid and an alkene. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option D (C6H10O2):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accommodates one C=O bond from the carboxylic acid and one C=C bond from the alkene. This option is consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe compound must have two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation to account for the carboxylic acid and alkene groups. Only the formula C6H10O2 satisfies these requirements.\n\n<<<D>>>"
