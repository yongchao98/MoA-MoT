    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and the Hypothetical Change**\n\n*   The Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction chains, primarily the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle.\n*   The pp-chain has three main branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III.\n*   The hypothetical scenario is that the pp-III branch stops. The key reaction in the pp-III branch is the decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B`), which produces high-energy neutrinos (`⁸B` neutrinos).\n*   Therefore, the flux of `⁸B` neutrinos becomes zero.\n*   The problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. This means the fluxes from the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO reactions are unchanged.\n*   The change happened ~8.5 minutes ago, which is the travel time for neutrinos from the Sun to Earth. This means we are observing the immediate effect of this change.\n\n**2. Analyze the Neutrino Sources in the Specified Energy Bands**\n\nWe need to identify which reactions produce neutrinos in the two given energy bands after the pp-III branch has stopped.\n\n*   **Band 1: 700-800 keV (0.7 - 0.8 MeV)**\n*   **Band 2: 800-900 keV (0.8 - 0.9 MeV)**\n\nLet's review the relevant neutrino sources and their energies:\n*   **pp-I (`p-p`) neutrinos:** Continuous spectrum with energy up to 420 keV. **Does not contribute to either band.**\n*   **pp-II (`⁷Be`) neutrinos:** Produces two monoenergetic (single energy) lines. The most prominent line is at **861 keV** (0.861 MeV), which falls directly inside **Band 2**. (A second, less frequent line at 384 keV is outside our bands of interest).\n*   **pp-III (`⁸B`) neutrinos:** Continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. This source is **turned off** in our scenario.\n*   **CNO cycle (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O`) neutrinos:** Continuous spectra extending up to 1.73 MeV. These neutrinos **contribute to both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\n**3. Determine the Composition of Flux in Each Band**\n\nAfter the `⁸B` neutrinos are gone, the fluxes in the bands are composed as follows:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The only remaining source in this energy range is the CNO cycle.\n    *   `Flux(Band 1) = Flux_CNO(in Band 1)`\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The sources are the `⁷Be` line and the CNO cycle.\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) = Flux_⁷Be(in Band 2) + Flux_CNO(in Band 2)`\n\n**4. Compare the Magnitudes of the Fluxes**\n\nTo find the ratio, we need to compare the sizes of these flux components. We can use the known total fluxes from the Standard Solar Model:\n\n*   **Total `⁷Be` Neutrino Flux:** ~ 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second. The vast majority of this (~90%) is concentrated in the 861 keV line.\n*   **Total CNO Neutrino Flux:** ~ 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos per cm² per second. This flux is spread out over a continuous energy spectrum.\n\nNow let's evaluate the flux in each band:\n\n*   **Flux(Band 2):** This band contains the extremely intense `⁷Be` line at 861 keV. The contribution from the continuous CNO spectrum in this narrow band is minuscule in comparison. Therefore, the flux in Band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the `⁷Be` neutrinos.\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux_⁷Be(861 keV line) ≈ 0.9 * (5 x 10⁹) = 4.5 x 10⁹`\n*   **Flux(Band 1):** This band's flux comes only from a small slice of the continuous CNO spectrum.\n\n**5. Formulate and Solve the Ratio**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio: `Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)`\n\n*   `Ratio ≈ Flux_CNO(in Band 1) / Flux_⁷Be(in Band 2)`\n\nA precise calculation would require integrating the CNO energy spectrum, but the multiple-choice format suggests a more conceptual, order-of-magnitude comparison. The question is structured to compare the primary contributor to Band 1 with the primary contributor to Band 2.\n\n*   The primary (and only) contributor to Band 1 is the CNO cycle.\n*   The primary (and vastly dominant) contributor to Band 2 is the `⁷Be` reaction from the pp-II chain.\n\nThe question is effectively asking for the ratio of the overall strength of the CNO flux compared to the `⁷Be` flux. We can approximate this by comparing their total fluxes.\n\n*   **Approximate Flux for Band 1 (representing CNO):** Total CNO Flux ≈ 5 x 10⁸\n*   **Approximate Flux for Band 2 (representing `⁷Be`):** Total `⁷Be` Flux ≈ 5 x 10⁹\n\nNow, calculate the ratio based on this conceptual approximation:\n\n*   `Ratio ≈ (Total CNO Flux) / (Total ⁷Be Flux)`\n*   `Ratio ≈ (5 x 10⁸) / (5 x 10⁹)`\n*   `Ratio = 1 / 10 = 0.1`\n\nThis result matches one of the options perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe stopping of the pp-III branch removes `⁸B` neutrinos, leaving CNO neutrinos as the sole source in Band 1 and `⁷Be` neutrinos as the dominant source in Band 2. The ratio of the total flux from the CNO cycle to the total flux from the `⁷Be` reaction is approximately 0.1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
