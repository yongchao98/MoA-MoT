    "An analysis of the question requires a step-by-step evaluation of each compound for the presence of chirality, which is the condition for optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or from axial/planar chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are connected by a C-C single bond. The ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions are substituted with large enough groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings is prevented. This is called restricted rotation.\n    *   The substituents (-NO2 and -COOCH3) are bulky enough to hinder rotation, forcing the two phenyl rings to be non-coplanar. This creates a chiral axis along the C1-C1' bond.\n    *   We must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry because the substituents on each ring are not arranged symmetrically. It also lacks a center of inversion.\n    *   Due to restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry elements, the molecule is chiral. This type of stereoisomerism is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** We look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral and therefore optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze benzophenone:**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzophenone is diphenyl ketone, with the structure (C6H5)-C(=O)-(C6H5).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp2 hybridized. We need to check for overall molecular symmetry.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has the plane of the molecule itself as a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral.\n    *   Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It does, however, show geometric (cis-trans) isomerism.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not. Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
