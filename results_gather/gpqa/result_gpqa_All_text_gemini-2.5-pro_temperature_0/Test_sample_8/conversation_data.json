    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each molecule to determine its point group, specifically looking for C3h symmetry.\n\n### **Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has the following symmetry elements:\n1.  A **three-fold axis of rotation (C3)**: The molecule looks identical after a rotation of 360°/3 = 120°.\n2.  A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**: The molecule has a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\nThe presence of both C3 and σh automatically generates a three-fold improper rotation axis (S3). A key feature of the C3h point group is the absence of any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and the absence of an inversion center (i).\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Molecule**\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms.\n    *   To have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that contains the B and three O atoms, each isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2] would need to be symmetrical with respect to this plane. This is not possible for a non-planar isopropyl group.\n    *   The lowest energy conformation of this molecule minimizes steric hindrance by twisting the isopropyl groups in a propeller-like fashion. This conformation possesses a C3 axis but lacks the σh plane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The point group of the stable conformation is C3, not C3h.\n\n**D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine with a bridgehead nitrogen atom and a bridgehead carbon atom, linked by three equivalent ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis. Such a plane would have to reflect the nitrogen atom onto the carbon atom, which is not a symmetry operation as they are different elements.\n    *   The molecule does possess three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** The point group is C3v, not C3h.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Mellitic trianhydride)**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is formed from a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (C1-C2, C3-C4, C5-C6).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Ideally, this molecule is planar. If it is planar, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself would act as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   The molecule does not have C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   Therefore, its idealized point group is C3h.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Due to significant ring strain from fusing three 5-membered rings onto a 6-membered ring, high-level calculations and experimental data show that the molecule is slightly distorted out of the plane into a propeller shape. This distortion removes the σh plane, making the actual point group C3. However, in many contexts, it is treated as an idealized planar C3h molecule.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has a large, rigid triphenylene core. Three anhydride groups are fused to the outer benzene rings of the triphenylene system in a symmetrically equivalent manner.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The triphenylene core is a large, stable, and planar aromatic system. The anhydride groups are fused far apart from each other, leading to minimal steric strain that would cause out-of-plane distortion. The molecule is planar.\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n    *   The molecular plane serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   The molecule lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is planar and its point group is unambiguously C3h.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Molecule A has C3 symmetry.\n*   Molecule D has C3v symmetry.\n*   Molecule B is often idealized as C3h, but its actual ground-state structure is C3 due to strain.\n*   Molecule C is a structurally sound, planar molecule that perfectly fits the C3h point group.\n\nComparing the options, molecule C is the best and most accurate example of a molecule with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
