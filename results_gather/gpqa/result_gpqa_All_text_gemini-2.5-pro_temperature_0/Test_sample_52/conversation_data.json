    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given information from the problem statement.**\n\n*   **Molecular Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the compound contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O). All the given formula options have O2, which is consistent.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Total Signals:** Six distinct signals, meaning there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** Two signals. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution, which would give an AA'BB' system appearing as two doublets. This accounts for a C6H4 fragment and 4 protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** Two signals. Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons, i.e., a methyl group (giving the quartet).\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for 5 protons (1H + 1H + 3H).\n    *   **-CH3 Groups:** Two signals. This means there are two methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n        *   The other methyl group must be a separate substituent. This accounts for 3 protons.\n    *   **-CH2 Groups:** No signals. This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates any structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other groups with a -CH2- unit.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n2.  An ester linkage: -COO-\n3.  A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n4.  A methyl group: -CH3\n\nWe need to combine these fragments into a single molecule. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the two substituents must be attached to the C6H4 ring.\n\n*   **Possibility A:** The substituents on the ring are the methyl group (-CH3) and an ester group where the propenyl group is the alcohol part (-COO-CH=CH-CH3). This gives the structure **propenyl 4-methylbenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n*   **Possibility B:** The substituents on the ring are the methyl group (-CH3) and an ester group where the propenyl group is the acid part (-OOC-CH=CH-CH3). This gives the structure **4-methylphenyl 2-butenoate**. This structure is also consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the chemical formula from the assembled structure.**\n\nLet's calculate the chemical formula for either of the possible structures, as they are isomers and will have the same formula. We will use propenyl 4-methylbenzoate.\n\n*   **Count the Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   From the methyl group on the ring: 1\n    *   From the benzene ring: 6\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (C=O): 1\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3\n    *   **Total Carbon = 1 + 6 + 1 + 3 = 11**\n*   **Count the Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   From the methyl group on the ring: 3\n    *   From the benzene ring: 4\n    *   From the propenyl group: 5 (1+1+3)\n    *   **Total Hydrogen = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12**\n*   **Count the Oxygen atoms (O):**\n    *   From the ester group: 2\n    *   **Total Oxygen = 2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\n*   A) C12H14O2\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C11H14O2\n*   D) C11H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points Check:**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C11H12O2, DBE = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6. This perfectly matches the structure: 4 for the benzene ring, 1 for the C=C double bond, and 1 for the C=O double bond.\n*   **Check other options:**\n    *   C11H14O2 (DBE=5): Incorrect DBE.\n    *   C12H12O2 (DBE=7): Incorrect DBE.\n    *   C12H14O2 (DBE=6): While the DBE is correct, this formula has an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. The problem explicitly states there are no -CH2- signals in the NMR, ruling this option out.\n\nTherefore, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
