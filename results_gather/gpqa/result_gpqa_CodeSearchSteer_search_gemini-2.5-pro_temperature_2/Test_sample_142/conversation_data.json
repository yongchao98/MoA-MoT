    "The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n### **Detailed Analysis:**\n\n**Part 1: Determining Starting Material 'A'**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + H₂SO₄ → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement, which converts a 1,2-diol (a pinacol) into a ketone (a pinacolone) under acidic conditions.\n*   **Product Analysis:** The product is a cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring containing a ketone. At the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C2), there are two p-tolyl groups.\n*   **Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards):**\n    1.  The product is a six-membered ring, while the rearrangement often involves a change in the carbon skeleton, such as a ring expansion. A common pathway to a cyclohexanone via pinacol rearrangement is the ring expansion of a cyclopentane derivative.\n    2.  Let's propose the starting material 'A' is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**. This molecule has a cyclopentane ring with a hydroxyl group on C1, and an adjacent side-chain carbon which also has a hydroxyl group and two p-tolyl groups.\n    3.  **Mechanism:**\n        *   **Protonation:** An acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) protonates one of the hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The -OH group on the side chain will be preferentially protonated because its departure creates a tertiary carbocation that is further stabilized by resonance with the two aromatic p-tolyl rings. This is a more stable intermediate than the tertiary carbocation that would form on the cyclopentane ring.\n        *   **Carbocation Formation:** The protonated hydroxyl group leaves as a water molecule, forming a stable tertiary carbocation: `(p-tolyl)₂C⁺-C(OH)(cyclopentyl)`.\n        *   **1,2-Alkyl Shift (Ring Expansion):** A bond from the cyclopentane ring (specifically, a C-C bond adjacent to the hydroxyl-bearing carbon) migrates to the positively charged carbon. This expands the five-membered ring into a six-membered ring.\n        *   **Formation of Ketone:** The positive charge is transferred to the carbon that originally held the ring's hydroxyl group. This new carbocation is immediately stabilized by the lone pair on the oxygen atom. Subsequent deprotonation yields the stable ketone product.\n    4.  **Resulting Structure:** This mechanism correctly forms a ketone on a six-membered ring with two p-tolyl groups on the adjacent carbon, matching the product **2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**. Therefore, starting material A must be **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n**Part 2: Determining Product 'B'**\n\n*   **Reaction:** methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H₂SO₄ → B\n*   **Starting Material Analysis:** The starting material, `CH₃-CH(OH)-C(p-tolyl)(OH)-COOCH₃`, is an unsymmetrical 1,2-diol. It has a secondary alcohol at C3 and a tertiary alcohol at C2.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Carbocation Formation:** The key to predicting the product of an unsymmetrical pinacol rearrangement is to determine which hydroxyl group will leave to form the most stable carbocation intermediate.\n        *   Losing the -OH from C3 would create a secondary carbocation.\n        *   Losing the -OH from C2 would create a tertiary carbocation, which is also benzylic (stabilized by the p-tolyl group). This tertiary carbocation is significantly more stable.\n    2.  Therefore, the reaction proceeds by protonating the tertiary -OH group at C2, followed by the loss of water to form the carbocation: `CH₃-CH(OH)-C⁺(p-tolyl)-COOCH₃`.\n    3.  **1,2-Shift (Migration):** Now, a group from the adjacent carbon (C3) must migrate to the carbocation at C2. The groups on C3 are a hydrogen atom and a methyl group. Migratory aptitude generally follows the order: Hydride (H⁻) > Aryl (like p-tolyl) > Alkyl (like methyl). In this case, the competition is between a hydride and a methyl group. The hydride (H) has a much higher migratory aptitude.\n    4.  **Final Product Formation:** A 1,2-hydride shift occurs from C3 to C2. The positive charge moves to C3. The resulting structure is `CH₃-C⁺(OH)-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH₃`. Deprotonation of the remaining hydroxyl group yields a ketone at the C3 position.\n*   **Resulting Structure:** The final product 'B' is `CH₃-C(=O)-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH₃`. The IUPAC name for this compound is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the mechanistic analysis of both reactions:\n*   A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol\n*   B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate\n\nThis corresponds exactly with option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
