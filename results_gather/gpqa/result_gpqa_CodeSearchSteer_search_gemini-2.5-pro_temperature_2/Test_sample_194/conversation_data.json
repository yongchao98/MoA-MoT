    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet, we must first understand the geometric conditions required for a planet to transit its star.\n\n### Summary of the Logic\n\n1.  **Shared Inclination:** Both planets are in the same orbital plane, meaning they orbit the star at the same inclination angle (`i`) relative to our line of sight.\n2.  **Transit Condition:** A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star. The standard definition for a transit event uses the impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance between the planet's center and the star's center at the closest approach, divided by the star's radius (`R_s`). A transit is considered to occur if the center of the planet passes over the stellar disk, which corresponds to an impact parameter `b` less than or equal to 1. An occultation (when the planet goes behind the star) will also occur if a transit happens, especially for a circular orbit.\n3.  **Using Planet 1:** We can use the information from the first planet to determine the system's geometry. The impact parameter `b1` is given by the formula `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a1` is the semi-major axis of the first planet. With `b1 = 0.2`, we can establish a relationship between the semi-major axis and the inclination.\n4.  **Finding the Limit for Planet 2:** For the second planet to transit, its impact parameter `b2` must be at most 1 (`b2 ≤ 1`). Since the inclination `i` and stellar radius `R_s` are the same, we can find the maximum possible semi-major axis (`a2`) for the second planet relative to the first planet.\n5.  **Applying Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (`P`) of a planet to its semi-major axis (`a`). For planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of their periods squared is equal to the ratio of their semi-major axes cubed: `(P2/P1)² = (a2/a1)³`. By finding the maximum ratio `a2/a1`, we can calculate the maximum period `P2`. The specific radii of the planets and the star are not required for this calculation if we use the standard `b ≤ 1` transit condition.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  From the data for Planet 1, we have its impact parameter:\n    `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s = 0.2`\n\n2.  For Planet 2, the condition for it to exhibit a transit is that its impact parameter `b2` must be less than or equal to 1. The maximum orbital period will correspond to the maximum possible semi-major axis, which in turn corresponds to the maximum impact parameter, so we set `b2 = 1`:\n    `b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_s = 1`\n\n3.  We can now find the ratio of the semi-major axes by dividing the equation for `b2` by the equation for `b1`:\n    `(a2 * cos(i) / R_s) / (a1 * cos(i) / R_s) = 1 / 0.2`\n    `a2 / a1 = 5`\n\n4.  This means the semi-major axis of the second planet can be at most 5 times that of the first planet.\n\n5.  Now, we apply Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods:\n    `(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`\n    `(P2 / 3 days)² = 5³ = 125`\n\n6.  Solving for `P2`:\n    `P2 / 3 = √125`\n    `P2 = 3 * √125`\n    `P2 = 3 * √(25 * 5)`\n    `P2 = 3 * 5 * √5`\n    `P2 = 15 * √5`\n\n7.  Using the approximation `√5 ≈ 2.236`:\n    `P2 ≈ 15 * 2.236`\n    `P2 ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<A>>>"
