    "To determine the correct statement, we must analyze the properties of the given operator for the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon, `Ay`.\n\n**1. Operator and Eigenvalue Calculation:**\n\nThe operator is given by `Ay = c∙S`, where the constant `c = h/4π` and `S` is the matrix `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\nRecognizing that the reduced Planck constant `ħ = h/2π`, we can rewrite `c` as `c = ħ/2`.\nThe matrix `S` is the Pauli spin matrix for the y-direction, `σ_y`.\nTherefore, the operator is `Ay = (ħ/2)σ_y`. This is the standard operator for the y-component of spin-1/2 angular momentum.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`a`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(Ay - aI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n\n`det([[-a, -iħ/2], [iħ/2, -a]]) = 0`\n`(-a)(-a) - (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) = 0`\n`a² - (-i²ħ²/4) = 0`\n`a² - ħ²/4 = 0`\n`a² = ħ²/4`\n`a = ± ħ/2`\n\nSubstituting `ħ = h/2π`, the eigenvalues are `a = ±(h/2π)/2 = ±h/4π`.\n\nThese eigenvalues are purely real numbers. This immediately refutes statements A and C, which claim the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Remaining Statements:**\n\n**Statement B: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.**\nThe matrix for `Ay` is given in a specific basis. This standard representation uses the eigenvectors of the Z-component operator (`Az`) as its basis vectors, which are `[1, 0]` (spin up) and `[0, 1]` (spin down). The eigenvectors (eigenfunctions `φ`) of `Ay` are different from this basis. For instance, the eigenvectors for `Ay` are `(1/√2) * [[1], [i]]` and `(1/√2) * [[1], [-i]]`. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n**Statement D: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.**\nThis statement concerns the commutation relations between angular momentum operators.\n*   **Ay and A²:** The total angular momentum squared operator, `A² = Ax² + Ay² + Az²`, commutes with all of its components, including `Ay`. The commutator `[A², Ay] = 0`. A fundamental theorem in quantum mechanics states that operators that commute have a common set of eigenfunctions. Thus, an eigenfunction of `Ay` is also an eigenfunction of `A²`.\n*   **Ay and Az:** The components of the angular momentum operator do not commute with each other. Specifically, `[Ay, Az] = iħAx ≠ 0`. Since these operators do not commute, they do not share a common set of eigenfunctions (except in trivial cases). Therefore, an eigenfunction of `Ay` cannot be an eigenfunction of `Az`.\n\nBoth parts of statement D are correct according to the fundamental principles of angular momentum in quantum mechanics.\n\n<<<D>>>"
