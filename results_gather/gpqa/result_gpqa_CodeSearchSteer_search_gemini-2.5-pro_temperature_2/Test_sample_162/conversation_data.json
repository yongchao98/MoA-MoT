    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum amount of strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and the pH of the final solution. The process involves stoichiometry and equilibrium calculations.\n\n### Step 1: Gather Initial Data\n\n*   **Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 0.1 g\n*   **Total Volume of Solution:** 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   **Concentration of Strong Acid:** 0.1 M\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** Approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   **Solubility Product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C:** The values for Ksp vary across sources, ranging from 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹ to 4 x 10⁻³⁸. Let's use a common value, approximately 2.8 x 10⁻³⁹.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Moles and Concentration of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we determine the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\nWhen this dissolves in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution, the concentration of Fe³⁺ ions will be:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume\n*   [Fe³⁺] = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\n### Step 3: Determine the pH of the Final Solution\n\nFor all the Fe(OH)₃ to dissolve, the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be, at minimum, equal to the Ksp. We can use this equilibrium to find the maximum allowable hydroxide concentration [OH⁻], which will then give us the pH.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   2.8 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³)[OH⁻]³\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (2.8 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.993 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] = (2.993 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.689 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nNow, we can find the pOH and then the pH:\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.689 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.17\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.17 = 1.83\n\nThis pH value is closest to the one given in option A.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required Volume of Acid\n\nThe added strong acid (H⁺) is used for two purposes:\n1.  To neutralize the hydroxide ions from the dissolving Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  To create the acidic environment (the final free [H⁺]) calculated in the previous step.\n\nThe dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for neutralization:** From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ remaining in solution:** This is the amount of free H⁺ that determines the final pH.\n    *   [H⁺] (final) = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-1.83) ≈ 1.479 x 10⁻² M\n    *   Moles H⁺ (final) = [H⁺] * Volume\n    *   Moles H⁺ (final) = (1.479 x 10⁻² mol/L) * 0.1 L = 1.479 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (final)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (1.479 x 10⁻³) = 4.286 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Volume of 0.1 M acid:**\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration\n    *   Volume = 4.286 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04286 L\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.04286 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 42.86 cm³\n\n### Conclusion and Analysis of Options\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH ≈ 1.83\n*   Volume ≈ 42.86 cm³\n\nLet's re-examine the options:\n*   A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   B) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n*   C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy between the calculated answer and the options provided. Let's recalculate using the pH from option A to see if the volume matches.\n\n**Assuming the final pH is 2.04 (from option A):**\n\n1.  **[H⁺] and [OH⁻]:**\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ ≈ 9.12 x 10⁻³ M\n    *   pOH = 14 - 2.04 = 11.96\n    *   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.⁹⁶ ≈ 1.10 x 10⁻¹² M\n\n2.  **Required [Fe³⁺] for equilibrium:**\n    *   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = Ksp / [OH⁻]³ = (2.8 x 10⁻³⁹) / (1.10 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 2.1 x 10⁻³ M\n\n3.  **Moles of Fe³⁺ (and Fe(OH)₃) dissolved:**\n    *   Moles Fe³⁺ = Concentration * Volume = (2.1 x 10⁻³ M) * 0.1 L = 2.1 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\nThis is less than the initial 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles of Fe(OH)₃ we wanted to dissolve. This indicates that the Ksp value used might be different from the one intended for the problem. Let's work backwards from the provided answers.\n\nLet's assume the numbers in option D are correct and see if they are consistent with a plausible Ksp value.\nIf pH = 2.69 and Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L:\n*   **Total H⁺ added** = 0.03009 L * 0.1 M = 3.009 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   **Moles Fe(OH)₃** = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n*   **Moles H⁺ reacted** = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   **Moles H⁺ remaining** = Total H⁺ added - Moles H⁺ reacted = 3.009 x 10⁻³ - 2.807 x 10⁻³ = 0.202 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   **[H⁺] remaining** = (0.202 x 10⁻³) / 0.1 L = 2.02 x 10⁻³ M.\n*   **pH from calculation** = -log₁₀(2.02 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.69.\n\nThis result matches the pH in option D perfectly. Let's check the Ksp this would imply:\n*   At pH 2.69, pOH = 14 - 2.69 = 11.31, so [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.³¹ M.\n*   The [Fe³⁺] in the solution is 9.357 x 10⁻³ M.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.357 x 10⁻³)(10⁻¹¹.³¹)³ ≈ 4.3 x 10⁻³⁸.\nThis Ksp value (4.3 x 10⁻³⁸) is within the reported range for Fe(OH)₃.\n\nTherefore, the calculations based on option D are internally consistent.\n\nFinal check of the calculations for option D:\n1.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**: 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n2.  **Moles of H⁺ to react**: 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ = 2.8071 x 10⁻³ mol.\n3.  **Moles of H⁺ for final pH**: At pH 2.69, [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M. In 0.1 L, this is (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) * 0.1 L = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n4.  **Total moles of H⁺**: (2.8071 x 10⁻³) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.0113 x 10⁻³ mol.\n5.  **Volume of 0.1 M acid**: (3.0113 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 M = 0.030113 L = 30.11 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (30.11 cm³) and pH (2.69) are an excellent match for the values in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
