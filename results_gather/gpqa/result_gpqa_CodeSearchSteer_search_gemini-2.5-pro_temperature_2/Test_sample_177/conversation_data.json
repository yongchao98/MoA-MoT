    "### **Determining the Mass Dimension of κ**\n\nTo determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ, we perform a dimensional analysis of the given Lagrangian density term in natural units (where ħ = c = 1). In a 4-dimensional spacetime, the action `S = ∫d⁴x L` must be dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of [x]⁴ = (M⁻¹)⁴ = M⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of M⁴.\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian is:\n`L_int = κ ψ-bar σ_μν ψ F^μν`\n\nWe need to find the mass dimensions of each component:\n\n1.  **Fermion Field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion is `L_fermion = ψ-bar(iγ^μ∂_μ - m)ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of M⁴, and knowing the derivative `∂_μ` has a dimension of M¹, the fermion field `ψ` must have a mass dimension of M^(3/2).\n\n2.  **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_EM = -1/4 F_μν F^μν`. For this term to have a dimension of M⁴, `F^μν` must have a mass dimension of M². This can also be seen from its definition `F^μν = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ`, where the four-potential `A^μ` has a dimension of M¹ and the derivative `∂^μ` has a dimension of M¹.\n\n3.  **Sigma Tensor (σ_μν):** The tensor `σ_μν = i/2[γ_μ, γ_ν]` is constructed from gamma matrices (`γ_μ`), which are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless.\n\nNow, we can set up the dimensional equation for the interaction term `L_int`:\n`[L_int] = [κ] [ψ-bar] [σ_μν] [ψ] [F^μν]`\n\nSubstituting the known mass dimensions:\n`M⁴ = [κ] * M^(3/2) * M⁰ * M^(3/2) * M²`\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n`M⁴ = [κ] * M³ * M²`\n`M⁴ = [κ] * M⁵`\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of κ:\n`[κ] = M⁴ / M⁵ = M⁻¹`\n\nThus, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### **Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension (dimensionless), the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is negative, the theory described by this interaction is **not renormalizable**. Such interaction terms require an infinite number of counterterms to cancel all divergences that appear at higher orders of perturbation theory, which diminishes the predictive power of the theory.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
