    "The calculation of the luminosity ratio depends on the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law.\n\n**1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a spherical black body with radius (R), is given by the formula:\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n**2. Wien's Displacement Law:** This law states that the wavelength at which a black body's radiation is most intense (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature. The formula is:\nλ_max = b/T\nwhere b is Wien's displacement constant.\n\n**Applying the Laws to the Problem:**\n\n*   From the problem statement, the wavelengths at which the two stars appear brightest are the same (λ_max1 = λ_max2).\n*   According to Wien's law, if the peak wavelengths are the same, their surface temperatures must also be the same.\n    *   b/T₁ = b/T₂  => T₁ = T₂\n\n**Calculating the Luminosity Ratio:**\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the luminosities (L₁ / L₂) of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nSince the temperatures (T₁ and T₂) and the constants (4, π, σ) are the same, they cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\nL₁ / L₂ = R₁² / R₂² = (R₁ / R₂)².\n\nWe are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), which means the ratio R₁/R₂ is 1.5.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)²\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThe additional information regarding the masses and radial velocities of the stars is not needed for this specific calculation, which is based on black-body radiation principles.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>"
