    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, 4, and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms it possesses.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a derivative of norbornadiene) is reacted with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Analysis of the diene precursor:** The compound \"5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene\" is not a standard chemical reagent. However, its name strongly suggests it is a precursor to a highly reactive diene, likely *o*-xylylene (also known as 1,2-quinodimethane). The standard synthesis of *o*-xylylene involves the debromination of 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene using zinc or sodium iodide. It is highly probable that the provided reagent, despite its unusual name, is intended to generate *o*-xylylene for a subsequent reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** The norbornadiene derivative acts as a dienophile, and the *o*-xylylene acts as a diene in a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, two separate Diels-Alder reactions occur, one at each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene system.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields a complex polycyclic cage-like molecule, which is the double *exo*-Diels-Alder adduct of 7-tert-butoxynorbornadiene and *o*-xylylene. This product contains the original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework fused to two new ring systems derived from the two *o*-xylylene molecules.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** Strong acid is used to cleave tert-butyl ethers. The *tert*-butoxy group (-O-tBu) at the C7 position of the bicyclic core is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is identical to product 1, but with an -OH group in place of the -O-tBu group.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Product 2 is treated with the sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃·py) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing alcohols. The secondary alcohol group (-CH-OH) at C7 is oxidized to a ketone (C=O).\n*   **Product 3:** The structure is the corresponding ketone.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3, a complex bridged ketone, is heated to 150°C. There are two primary possibilities for the thermal reaction of such a structure: a retro-Diels-Alder reaction or a cheletropic elimination (decarbonylation).\n    1.  A simple retro-Diels-Alder would regenerate the reactants (or their equivalents), which would likely lead to a mixture of products.\n    2.  A more plausible pathway for such puzzle-like problems involves fragmentation followed by a specific reassembly into a single, well-defined product.\n\n*   **Proposed Pathway:** Heating Product 3 induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, causing it to fragment. The initial fragments would be two molecules of *o*-xylylene and one molecule of 7-ketonorbornadiene.\n*   **Decomposition:** 7-ketonorbornadiene is known to be unstable and readily eliminates carbon monoxide (CO) via a cheletropic extrusion to form the highly stable aromatic molecule, benzene.\n*   **Reassembly:** At this stage, the reaction mixture contains benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of *o*-xylylene. The reactive *o*-xylylene molecules will proceed to react. One molecule of *o*-xylylene will react as a diene with benzene (acting as a dienophile) to form 9,10-dihydro-9,10-ethenoanthracene, also known as dibenzobarrelene. This product still has a reactive double bond on its etheno bridge.\n*   The second molecule of *o*-xylylene then reacts with the double bond of dibenzobarrelene in another Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product, 4, is the Diels-Alder adduct of dibenzobarrelene and *o*-xylylene. Its molecular formula is C₂₂H₂₂.\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of product 4. The addition of the *o*-xylylene moiety to the symmetric dibenzobarrelene molecule results in a product that possesses a plane of symmetry (Cₛ symmetry). This plane bisects the structure, making halves of the molecule mirror images of each other.\n\n1.  **Dibenzobarrelene Moiety Protons:**\n    *   **Bridgehead Protons:** The two bridgehead protons lie on the plane of symmetry but are in chemically different environments. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two original benzene rings are mirror images of each other. Within each ring, the four protons are all chemically non-equivalent due to the fused cage structure. This gives **4 distinct signals** (each integrating to 2H).\n\n2.  ***o*-Xylylene Adduct Moiety Protons:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The new bridge is formed from two -CH₂- groups. These two groups are equivalent, related by the mirror plane. Within each -CH₂- group, the two protons are diastereotopic (non-equivalent) due to the chiral environment of the cage. This results in **2 distinct signals** (each integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The benzene ring from the *o*-xylylene is bisected by the plane of symmetry. This makes the four protons on this ring appear as two pairs of equivalent protons. This results in **2 distinct signals** (each integrating to 2H).\n\nSumming up the distinct signals: 2 (bridgehead) + 4 (original aromatic) + 2 (aliphatic) + 2 (new aromatic) = **10 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**.\n\nTherefore, the final product, 4, has 10 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
