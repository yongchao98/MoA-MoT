    "The treatment of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a known method for the synthesis of α-diketones (also called 1,2-diketones). This reaction proceeds through several steps. First, sodium nitrite and HCl react to form nitrous acid (HONO). In the acidic solution, the ketone undergoes keto-enol tautomerization to form an enol. The enol, which is electron-rich, then attacks the electrophilic nitrosating agent (derived from nitrous acid) at the α-carbon. The initial product is an α-nitroso ketone, which is unstable and tautomerizes to a more stable α-oxime. Finally, acidic hydrolysis of the α-oxime yields the α-diketone. This overall process is often referred to as the nitrosation of a ketone.\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the starting ketone must have at least one hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent (in the α-position) to the carbonyl group. This α-hydrogen is removed during the enol formation, and the α-carbon is subsequently oxidized to a new carbonyl group.\n\nLet's apply this to the specific reactions given:\n\n**Reaction A: Formation of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\n\nThe product is an α-diketone with carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 2 of a cyclohexane ring. According to the reaction mechanism, this product is formed by introducing a carbonyl group at the α-position of a starting ketone. Therefore, the starting material A must be a ketone with the carbonyl group at either position 1 or 2.\n\nIf we start with **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**, it has a carbonyl group at C1. The α-positions are C2 and C6. Both of these are methylene (CH₂) groups. The reaction with NaNO₂, HCl, and H₂O would oxidize one of these α-methylene groups (e.g., C2) into a carbonyl group, yielding the desired product, 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. This makes 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one a suitable starting material for compound A.\n\n**Reaction B: Formation of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\n\nThe product here is also an α-diketone, with carbonyls at the C2 and C3 positions. This means the starting material B must have been either a ketone at C2 or C3 with an adjacent CH or CH₂ group.\n\nIf we consider **5-methylhexan-2-one** as the starting material, the carbonyl group is at C2. The α-positions are C1 (a methyl group, -CH₃) and C3 (a methylene group, -CH₂-). The reaction will occur at the more substituted α-carbon that has hydrogens, which is C3. The oxidation of the methylene group at C3 will result in a carbonyl group, producing 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. Thus, 5-methylhexan-2-one is a correct precursor for compound B.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** These are not ketones and the reaction conditions are not standard for oxidizing alcohols or diols to diketones.\n*   **B) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** While B is a plausible starting material, A is not.\n*   **C) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** Both A and B are ketones that, upon reaction with NaNO₂, HCl, and H₂O, would yield the specified α-diketone products.\n*   **D) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** While A is a plausible starting material, B is not.\n\nTherefore, the correct starting materials are 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one (A) and 5-methylhexan-2-one (B).\n\n<<<C>>>"
