    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the powers of `(4π)` in the denominator of the mathematical expression for the diagram's contribution.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations using dimensional regularization in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a diagram contributes a factor of `1/(4π)²` to the final expression. The term in question is `1/(4π)⁶`.\n\nBy rewriting this term as `(1/(4π)² )³`, we can see that the power of the `1/(4π)²` factor is 3. This indicates that the Feynman diagram contained three loops. The other factors in the expression, such as the coupling constants (`α³`, `g²`) and numerical values, relate to other properties of the diagram like the number and type of vertices, but the power of `4π` is the key to determining the number of loops.\n\n<<<A>>>"
