    "The physical process in question is pair production, where a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) collides with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to create an electron-positron pair (e⁺e⁻). For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron and positron combined.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the threshold energy:\n\n1.  **Define the reaction:** The interaction is `γ + γ_CMB → e⁺ + e⁻`.\n\n2.  **Energy and Momentum Conservation:** The condition for the minimum energy (threshold energy) of the high-energy gamma-ray is that the electron and positron are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame. To find this, we use the invariance of the square of the four-momentum.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Invariant Calculation:** The threshold energy `E_γ` for the high-energy photon can be calculated using the formula:\n    `E_γ = (m_e * c²)² / E_CMB`\n    This formula assumes a head-on collision, which provides the lowest possible threshold energy.\n\n4.  **Identify the constants:**\n    *   `m_e * c²` is the rest mass-energy of an electron. This is a well-established physical constant with a value of approximately 0.511 MeV.\n    *   `E_CMB` is the average energy of a CMB photon, which is given in the problem as `10⁻³ eV`.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   First, ensure all energy units are consistent. Let's use electron volts (eV).\n    *   Rest mass-energy of an electron `(m_e * c²)` = 0.511 MeV = `0.511 * 10⁶ eV`.\n    *   Energy of a CMB photon `(E_CMB)` = `10⁻³ eV`.\n    *   Now, substitute these values into the formula:\n        `E_γ = (0.511 * 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)`\n        `E_γ = (0.261121 * 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)`\n        `E_γ = 0.261121 * 10¹⁵ eV`\n        `E_γ = 2.61121 * 10¹⁴ eV`\n\n6.  **Convert the result to Giga-electron volts (GeV):**\n    *   `1 GeV = 10⁹ eV`\n    *   `E_γ = (2.61121 * 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)`\n    *   `E_γ = 2.61121 * 10⁵ GeV`\n\nThis result indicates that high-energy gamma-rays with an energy of approximately `2.6 * 10⁵ GeV` would have their lifetimes significantly limited by interactions with the Cosmic Microwave Background, leading to electron-positron pair production. Comparing this calculated value to the given options, it most closely matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
