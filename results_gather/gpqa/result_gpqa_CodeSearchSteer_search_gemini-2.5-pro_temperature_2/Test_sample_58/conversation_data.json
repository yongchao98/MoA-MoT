    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acids and the base and then determine which, if any, is in excess after the neutralization reactions.\n\n### 1. Calculate Initial Moles\n\nFirst, calculate the number of moles for each component:\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 moles of CH₃COOH**\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 moles of HCl** (which provides 0.080 moles of H⁺)\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Barium hydroxide dissociates completely in water: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻. Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles of Ba(OH)₂.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 moles of OH⁻**\n\n### 2. Perform Neutralization Stoichiometry\n\nNeutralization reactions will occur between the acids (H⁺ providers) and the base (OH⁻). The strong acid (HCl) will react first with the strong base (Ba(OH)₂), followed by the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Total moles of acid available for reaction:** 0.080 moles from HCl + 0.050 moles from CH₃COOH = **0.130 moles of H⁺**.\n*   **Total moles of base available for reaction:** **0.180 moles of OH⁻**.\n\nSince there are more moles of OH⁻ than total moles of H⁺, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\nNow, calculate the moles of excess OH⁻:\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = Initial moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of H⁺\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 moles of excess OH⁻**\n\n### 3. Calculate Final Concentration and pH\n\nThe excess hydroxide ions will determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the mixed solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Finally, calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
