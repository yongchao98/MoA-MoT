    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Understand Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), which is the average distance from its star. For the circular orbits in this problem, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital radius. The relationship can be expressed as P² ∝ a³.\n\n**2. Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (Teq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. For a planet that radiates like a blackbody, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star (Teq ∝ 1/√a). This assumes the star's properties are constant and the planet's albedo doesn't change. The problem states that the planets have the same albedo.\n\n**3. Combine the Relationships:**\n*   From Kepler's Third Law, we have P² ∝ a³. We can write this as a ∝ P^(2/3).\n*   From the equilibrium temperature relationship, we have Teq ∝ a^(-1/2).\n*   Substituting the expression for 'a' from Kepler's law into the temperature relationship, we get:\n    Teq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3)\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculate the Temperature Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T4/T2). Using the relationship derived above:\n\nT4 / T2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nTherefore, the ratio of the period of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\n\nP4 / P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\n\nT4 / T2 = (1.75)^(-1/3) = 1 / (1.75)^(1/3)\nT4 / T2 ≈ 1 / 1.205\nT4 / T2 ≈ 0.83\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet\\_4 and Planet\\_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
