    "The correct answer is C. Here is a detailed analysis of each statement:\n\n*   **A) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.** This statement is **correct**. All coronaviruses utilize a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) event to translate their overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b, producing polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. [9, 14] This process is mediated by a slippery sequence and a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure. [2, 10] Structural analyses have confirmed that the pseudoknots of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have nearly identical conformations and topologies. [2, 8]\n\n*   **B) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.** This statement is **correct**. Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein induces apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic pathway, without altering the levels of Bcl-2, a crucial regulator of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. [1, 4, 7] This evidence strongly indicates that ORF3a triggers cell death through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. [4]\n\n*   **C) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.** This statement is **incorrect**. The nsp14 protein contains an N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain which forms an active proofreading complex with its cofactor, nsp10. [16, 22] The primary function of this complex is to ensure replication fidelity by *removing* mismatched nucleotides from the 3' end of the newly synthesized RNA strand. [5, 21] This involves the *hydrolysis* or *breakdown* of the RNA strand at the site of the error. The statement incorrectly claims that the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA, which is the opposite of its known function. The complex hydrolyzes dsRNA at mismatched 3' ends to correct errors. [21]\n\n*   **D) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.** This statement is **correct**. Research has established a correlation between the efficiency of frameshifting and the conformational dynamics of the RNA pseudoknot. [8, 9] It has been shown that a linear correlation can be drawn between the in vitro frameshifting rate and the number of conformations a pseudoknot populates. [8] Single-molecule studies have demonstrated that the frameshift signals of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 adopt two main conformations under tension, which corresponds to their measured frameshifting efficiencies of approximately 15-30%.
