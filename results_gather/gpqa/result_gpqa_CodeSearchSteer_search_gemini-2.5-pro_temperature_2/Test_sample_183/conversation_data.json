    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of the substitution patterns and reaction types is required. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's analyze the proposed sequences:\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Option A:**\nThis sequence appears to be the most plausible, although it has steps that require careful consideration regarding yield and regioselectivity.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation):** Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene. This is a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The bulky tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director, but it sterically hinders the ortho position. This results in the para-isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) being the major product (around 75%), with the desired ortho-isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) as a minor product (around 16%). This step presents a yield problem.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl (Reduction):** The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂), yielding 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. This is a standard reduction reaction.\n4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** This step involves the nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. Predicting the outcome requires analyzing the directing effects of both the amino and tert-butyl groups. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group at position 2 is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to positions 3 and 5. Although position 5 might be sterically favored, formation of the 3-nitro product is required. This specific reaction is a known step in the synthesis of the drug Ivacaftor, confirming its viability. The product is 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline (or 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene).\n5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl (Diazotization):** The primary amino group of 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat (Hydrolysis):** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to form 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr (Williamson Ether Synthesis):** The phenolic proton is removed by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile, attacking ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ether product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nThe extra steps listed in the original option, `viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄` and `ix) dilute H₂SO₄`, are sulfonation and desulfonation. A plausible explanation is that these steps are used as a purification technique after step (ii) to separate the ortho- and para-nitro isomers, thereby increasing the effective yield of the desired ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene needed for the subsequent steps. This would address the low-yield issue from the initial nitration. A similar blocking group strategy is known for obtaining otherwise difficult-to-isolate isomers.\n\n**Analysis of Other Options:**\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These sequences contain chemically incorrect steps. For instance, option B attempts to perform diazotization before an amine is formed. Option C suggests nitrating a diazonium salt with HNO₃/H₂SO₄, which is not a standard or logical transformation in this context.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins by nitrating benzene and then reducing it to aniline. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and leading to poor yields and incorrect regioselectivity.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, Option A presents the only chemically coherent, albeit complex, pathway to the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>"
