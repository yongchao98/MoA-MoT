    "To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we will follow a series of calculations based on the provided information. The key steps involve calculating the size of the event horizon from its angular diameter and then using this to find the entropy via the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.\n\n### 1. Unit Conversions\n\nFirst, we convert the given distance and angular size into SI units to ensure consistency in our calculations.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** The distance to the galaxy is given as 10¹⁰ parsecs. One parsec is approximately 3.086 × 10¹⁶ meters.\n    d = 10¹⁰ pc × (3.086 × 10¹⁶ m/pc) = 3.086 × 10²⁶ m\n\n*   **Angular Size (θ):** The angular size of the event horizon is 10⁻¹⁷ degrees. For calculations in physics, angles are typically expressed in radians. To convert from degrees to radians, we multiply by π/180.\n    θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees × (π / 180 radians/degree) ≈ 1.745 × 10⁻¹⁹ radians\n\n### 2. Calculating the Event Horizon Radius\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation, the diameter of the event horizon (D = 2r_s, where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius) is related to its angular size (θ) and the distance (d) by the formula D = θd. We can solve for the Schwarzschild radius r_s:\n\nr_s = (θ × d) / 2\nr_s = (1.745 × 10⁻¹⁹ rad × 3.086 × 10²⁶ m) / 2\nr_s ≈ 2.69 × 10⁷ m\n\n### 3. Calculating the Event Horizon Area\n\nThe area of the event horizon (A) of a Schwarzschild black hole is given by the formula for the surface area of a sphere:\n\nA = 4πr_s²\nA = 4π × (2.69 × 10⁷ m)²\nA ≈ 9.09 × 10¹⁵ m²\n\n### 4. Calculating the Black Hole Entropy\n\nThe entropy of a black hole is described by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. This formula connects the geometric properties of a black hole with its thermodynamic entropy. The formula is:\n\nS = (k_B * c³ * A) / (4 * G * ħ)\n\nWhere:\n*   k_B is the Boltzmann constant (≈ 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)\n*   c is the speed of light (≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s)\n*   G is the gravitational constant (≈ 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ N m²/kg²)\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.05 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   A is the area of the event horizon we calculated (≈ 9.09 × 10¹⁵ m²)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\nS ≈ ( (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K) × (3.00 × 10⁸ m/s)³ × (9.09 × 10¹⁵ m²) ) / ( 4 × (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ N m²/kg²) × (1.05 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) )\nS ≈ (1.38 × 27 × 9.09 × 10¹⁶) / (4 × 6.67 × 1.05 × 10⁻⁴⁵) J/K\nS ≈ (338.6 × 10¹⁶) / (28.0 × 10⁻⁴⁵) J/K\nS ≈ 12.1 × 10⁶¹ J/K\nS ≈ 1.21 × 10⁶² J/K\n\nThe calculated entropy is on the order of magnitude of 10⁶² J/K. Comparing this result with the given options, the closest is 10⁶² J/K.\n\n<<<B>>>"
