    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we first need to understand the starting material and the nature of the chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. The Starting Material\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to find its initial IHD, which represents the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This accounts for one ring and one π bond.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This functional group (-COOH) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This adds one π bond.\n*   **formyl**: This functional group (-CHO) is an aldehyde, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This adds another π bond.\n*   **vinyl**: This functional group (-CH=CH₂) contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This adds one more π bond.\n\nCounting these up, the initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is:\nIHD = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus (P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) and ketones (>C=O) are reduced to methylene (-CH₂-) or methyl (-CH₃) groups.\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are fully reduced to methyl (-CH₃) groups.\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are saturated to become single bonds (C-C).\n*   Alcohols are also reduced to alkanes.\n\n### 3. The Final Product\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the π bonds in the starting material. The core ring structure, however, remains intact.\n*   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced.\n*   The C=O bond in the formyl group is reduced.\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced.\n\nThe four π bonds in the molecule are all removed by the reduction reaction. The only element of unsaturation that remains is the cyclohexane ring itself.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is a count of rings and π bonds in a molecule. Since all four π bonds are eliminated during the reaction, the final product, a substituted cyclohexane, has an IHD corresponding only to its single ring structure.\n\nEach ring in a molecule contributes 1 to the IHD. Therefore, the IHD of the final product is **1**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
