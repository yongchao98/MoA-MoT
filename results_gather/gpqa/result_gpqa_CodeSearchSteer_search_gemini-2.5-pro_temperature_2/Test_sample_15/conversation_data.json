    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule has one or more chiral centers and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E), which specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer. The presence of these defined chiral centers without an element of symmetry that would render it a meso compound indicates that this specific molecule is a single enantiomer and thus, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters at carbons 2 and 3. However, because the substituents on both chiral carbons are the same (H, CH3, COOH), the (2R,3S) configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive despite having chiral centers.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound is a diastereomer of the meso form. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid). Since it is a specific, single enantiomer and lacks an internal plane of symmetry, it is chiral and optically active.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation (R) specifies the configuration at the chiral center, C1, which is bonded to four different groups (H, OH, C2, and C6 which are part of different paths around the ring). As this is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: Assuming the notation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis), the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the compound achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule does not have any chiral centers. Furthermore, it possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group (C=O) and the adjacent CH2 group. Due to this symmetry, the compound is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
