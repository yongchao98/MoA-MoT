    "The key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm, when solving higher dimensional heat equations using higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting where the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation, is the use of a linear partial fraction decomposition of that fractional approximation.\n\nWhen the matrix exponential function `exp(lA)` is approximated by a rational function `R(lA)`, a partial fraction expansion can be used. This is particularly useful in parallel processing. This technique allows the problem to be broken down into a series of smaller, independent linear systems. These independent systems can then be solved simultaneously on separate processors, which is the essence of a parallel algorithm. Several research papers explicitly state that the resulting algorithm readily admits parallelization through this partial fraction expansion.\n\nWhile stability analysis is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the numerical method, it is a necessary property for both sequential and parallel algorithms, not the specific enabler of parallelization. Furthermore, some parallel methods are specifically designed to avoid complex roots in the fractional approximation to prevent the accumulation of round-off errors. The type of boundary conditions, such as nonlocal ones, defines the problem being solved rather than the parallelization strategy itself.\n\n<<<A>>>"
