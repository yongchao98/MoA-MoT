    "This problem requires an analysis of the selectivity of two different reducing agents and the application of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to determine the stereochemistry of the starting materials.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the chemical reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Product:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. It possesses one carboxylic acid group (-COOH), one ester group (-COOiBu), and a single stereocenter at the third carbon, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   **Product:** The reactions yield the (R) and (S) enantiomers of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a cyclic ester (lactone).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity:**\n    *   **Reagent A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that can reduce both esters and carboxylic acids. However, it is generally more effective and selective for the reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Reagent B (BH₃):** Borane is a reducing agent that is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids, leaving esters intact.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction Pathways and Stereochemistry:**\n\n    *   **Reaction A (with LiBH₄):**\n        *   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains, and subsequent intramolecular esterification (lactonization) under acidic workup (H⁺) yields the pyranone product.\n        *   **Stereochemistry:** To determine the stereochemical outcome, we must assign priorities to the groups on the chiral center of the starting material according to CIP rules.\n            *   For the starting material (`A`), the priorities are: (1) `-CH₂COOiBu` > (2) `-CH₂COOH` > (3) `-CH₂CH₃` > (4) `-H`.\n            *   The reaction reduces group #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. In the resulting hydroxy acid, the original group #2 (`-CH₂COOH`) now takes the highest priority, and the newly formed `-CH₂CH₂OH` group becomes priority #2.\n            *   This **swapping of priorities #1 and #2 causes an inversion of the R/S descriptor**. For instance, an (S) starting material will form an (R) intermediate, which then cyclizes to an (R) product.\n            *   Since Reaction A yields the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material `A` must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n    *   **Reaction B (with BH₃):**\n        *   **Pathway:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) remains. Intramolecular transesterification then occurs to form the lactone product, displacing isobutanol.\n        *   **Stereochemistry:** We look again at the CIP priorities of the starting material.\n            *   Priorities: (1) `-CH₂COOiBu` > (2) `-CH₂COOH` > (3) `-CH₂CH₃` > (4) `-H`.\n            *   This reaction reduces group #2 (`-CH₂COOH`) to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The original group #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains group #1 in the intermediate. The new `-CH₂CH₂OH` group has a lower priority than group #1 but higher than group #3. Thus, the priority order of the groups attached to the stereocenter is preserved.\n            *   Since the priority order does not change, there is **retention of the R/S descriptor**. An (S) starting material will lead to an (S) product.\n            *   Since Reaction B yields the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material `B` must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials A and B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
