    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra to Determine its Structure\n\nThe problem provides the ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data for the product formed after Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO).\n\n**¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n*   A signal at **δ 197.7** is highly characteristic of a **carbonyl carbon in a ketone or aldehyde**.\n*   Signals at **δ 21.3** and **δ 28.4** are in the typical range for **aliphatic (sp³) carbons**, likely methyl groups.\n\n**¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** A singlet for three protons strongly suggests a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a **methyl ketone**, -COCH₃). This corresponds to the ¹³C signal at δ 28.4.\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** Another three-proton singlet indicates a second methyl group that has no adjacent protons, likely attached to an aromatic ring. This corresponds to the ¹³C signal at δ 21.3.\n*   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a **para-substituted benzene ring**. The presence of the methyl singlet at δ 2.28 further suggests a **p-tolyl group** (a toluene ring substituted at the para position).\n*   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d):** These two doublets in the vinylic region indicate a **disubstituted double bond** (-CH=CH-). The significant downfield shift suggests it is part of a conjugated system with the ketone and the aromatic ring.\n\n**Putting the Pieces Together:**\nThe identified fragments are:\n1.  A methyl ketone group (CH₃CO-).\n2.  A p-tolyl group (p-CH₃C₆H₄-).\n3.  A trans double bond (-CH=CH-).\n\nConnecting these fragments logically leads to the structure **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. Its molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches that of the starting material, Compound X. This indicates the reaction is an isomerization.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Compound X\n\n*   **Reactant:** Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O)\n*   **Reagent:** DABCO, a non-nucleophilic base.\n*   **Conditions:** High temperature (403 K or 130 °C).\n*   **Product:** 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\nThe reaction is a base-catalyzed isomerization of Compound X to an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Now we must evaluate the given options to see which one could be Compound X.\n\n*   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The IUPAC name is 2-(2-(4-methylphenyl)ethenyl)oxirane. Its structure contains a p-tolyl group attached to a vinyl group, which is connected to an epoxide ring. Its molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. The rearrangement of vinyl epoxides to unsaturated ketones is a known chemical transformation, often catalyzed by bases like DABCO. This type of reaction is a variation of the Meinwald rearrangement. Therefore, this is a very plausible candidate.\n\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match C₁₁H₁₂O. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** The molecular formula is C₁₂H₁₂O, which does not match. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, which is correct. However, this molecule has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Rearrangement of this compound would lead to a product without a methyl group on the benzene ring, which contradicts the product structure determined from the NMR data. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, Compound X must be an isomer of 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one that can rearrange under the given conditions. Only **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane** (Option A) fits all the criteria: it has the correct molecular formula and its structure is known to undergo a base-catalyzed isomerization with DABCO to form the specific α,β-unsaturated ketone identified from the NMR spectra.\n\n<<<A>>>"
