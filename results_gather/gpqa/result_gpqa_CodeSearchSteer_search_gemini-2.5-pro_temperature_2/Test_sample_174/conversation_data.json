    "An oscillating spheroid-shaped charge distribution, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The power radiated per unit solid angle by such a dipole is not uniform in all directions.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle ( dP/dΩ ) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀²ω⁴)/(32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `θ` is the angle between the oscillation axis (z-axis) and the direction of observation.\n\nFrom this formula, the angular distribution of the radiated power is proportional to `sin²(θ)`.\n\nThe maximum power, A, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value, which is 1. This occurs at `θ = 90°`, perpendicular to the axis of oscillation. So, `A` is proportional to 1.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`, we calculate `sin²(30°)`:\n\n`sin(30°) = 1/2`\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThe power radiated at 30° is therefore 1/4 of the maximum power A.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe radiated power `f` is also a function of the oscillation frequency `ω`, as seen in the formula `dP/dΩ`. The power is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is:\n\n`ω = 2πν = 2πc/λ`\n\nTherefore, the power's dependence on wavelength is:\n\n`P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is a key feature of electric dipole radiation, also known as Rayleigh scattering. Shorter wavelengths are scattered much more strongly than longer wavelengths, which is why the sky appears blue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at `θ = 30°` is 1/4, and the possible form of the function `f` for the radiated power is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
