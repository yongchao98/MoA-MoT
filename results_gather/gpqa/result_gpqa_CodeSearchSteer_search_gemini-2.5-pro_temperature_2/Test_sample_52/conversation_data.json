    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a base formula of C6H4.\n\n2.  **Interpret the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Vinyl-H Signals:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons, a doublet and a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring. The proton on the carbon bonded to the ring is split into a doublet by its vinyl neighbor. The other vinyl proton is split into a doublet by its vinyl neighbor and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This propenyl group substituent has the formula -C3H5.\n    *   **–CH3 Signals:** There are two signals for methyl groups. One belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**). The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n    *   **No –CH2 Signals:** The absence of any signals for –CH2 groups is a crucial piece of information. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or any other substituent containing a methylene bridge.\n\n3.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-). Combining this with the NMR data, the ester must incorporate the second methyl group and have no methylene groups. This leads to two possibilities for the second substituent:\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group: -COOCH3\n    *   An acetoxy group: -O-CO-CH3\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula:**\nLet's calculate the molecular formula for both possible structures.\n\n*   **Structure 1:** A propenyl group and a methoxycarbonyl group attached to a benzene ring (e.g., methyl p-propenylbenzoate).\n    *   Benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: -C3H5\n    *   Methoxycarbonyl group: -COOCH3 (which contributes C2H3O2)\n    *   **Total Formula:** C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O2 = **C11H12O2**\n\n*   **Structure 2:** A propenyl group and an acetoxy group attached to a benzene ring (e.g., p-propenylphenyl acetate).\n    *   Benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: -C3H5\n    *   Acetoxy group: -OCOCH3 (which contributes C2H3O2)\n    *   **Total Formula:** C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O2 = **C11H12O2**\n\nBoth structures that fit all the spectroscopic data have the same molecular formula, C11H12O2.\n\n5.  **Check the Degree of Unsaturation:**\nFor C11H12O2, the degree of unsaturation is (2*11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 6. This corresponds to a benzene ring (4 units), one C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 unit), and one C=O double bond in the ester group (1 unit), which perfectly matches our derived structures. The other molecular formulas are inconsistent with the spectral data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
