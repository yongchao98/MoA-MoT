    "To identify the correct 1H NMR data, we must first deduce the most probable structure of the compound based on the given information.\n\n### Analysis of Molecular Structure\n\n1.  **Core Structure**: The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring with two substituents. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms (C6H4).\n2.  **Total Carbons**: The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Functional Groups**: The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen atom directly attached to the benzene ring).\n\nCombining these facts, we have a halogen substituent (-X) and a second substituent that contains two carbons and a carbonyl group. The most plausible and common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group, â€“C(O)CH3.\n\nThis leads to the structure of a haloacetophenone. Given the simplicity of the NMR options, a symmetrical *para* (1,4) substitution is the most likely arrangement. The proposed structure is therefore **p-haloacetophenone**.\n\n### Predicted 1H NMR for p-Haloacetophenone\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for this structure (X-C6H4-C(O)CH3):\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons**: The benzene ring is para-substituted by two electron-withdrawing groups (the halogen and the acetyl group). This symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons. We expect two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm), each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the neighboring proton, and each integrating to 2H.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons**: There is a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a carbonyl group. This methyl ketone environment typically produces a sharp singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with) with an integration of 3H. The chemical shift is usually around 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n*   **Total Protons**: The molecule, C8H7OX, has 4 aromatic protons and 3 methyl protons, for a total of 7 protons.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks the typical signals for a para-substituted aromatic ring and includes peaks (4.8, 4.6 ppm) that are not characteristic of aromatic protons.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for p-haloacetophenone.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, characteristic of a para-substituted ring. For instance, 4'-Bromoacetophenone shows doublets at 7.82 ppm and 7.61 ppm. The protons ortho to the deshielding carbonyl group appear further downfield.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a 3H singlet in the expected region for a methyl ketone. The total proton count is 2+2+3=7, which matches the structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option shows no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm), which rules it out.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest a different structure, such as p-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde. However, for that structure, the methylene protons (`-CH2-`) should be a doublet (split by the aldehyde proton), and the aldehyde proton should be a triplet (split by the methylene protons). The provided data with two singlets is atypical. Furthermore, the aromatic shifts (7.8, 7.6 ppm) are too far downfield for a p-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde, whose signals are typically found further upfield.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data presented in option B is fully consistent with the structure of a p-haloacetophenone, which satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. The chemical shifts and splitting patterns are a textbook match for this compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
