    "The final product of the reaction sequence is identified through a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and intermediates.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the degree of unsaturation is 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group. The 1H-NMR data is interpreted as follows:\n*   **9.72 (t, 1H):** An aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to a -CH2- group.\n*   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   **3.66 (d, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde proton.\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde** (also known as 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal).\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** These reagents are used for diazotization, which converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to the corresponding diazonium salt.\n2.  **H2O:** The addition of water hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it undergoes a self-aldol condensation. This reaction proceeds in two stages:\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** Two molecules of the aldehyde react to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (D).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The application of heat causes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration forms a double bond, resulting in a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nBecause the reaction is heated, the dehydration step is driven to completion, making the condensation product the final major product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
