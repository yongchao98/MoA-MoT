    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture based on the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Options\nAll four compounds listed have the molecular formula C10H14, so this information does not eliminate any options.\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** (Durene)\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** (Isodurene)\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Prehnitene)\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Aromatic Region Signals\nThe 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets in the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates that the mixture contains two different compounds, each producing a single, distinct signal for its aromatic protons.\n\n*   Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers has a plane of symmetry that results in its two aromatic protons being chemically equivalent, thus producing a single signal (a singlet) for 2 hydrogens.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene also has high symmetry, and its four aromatic protons are equivalent, which would produce one singlet integrating to 4 hydrogens.\n\nA 1:1 mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers would result in two aromatic singlets, each for 2H, giving the observed 1:1 ratio. However, a mixture of a tetramethylbenzene (2H) and 1,4-diethylbenzene (4H) would give a 1:2 ratio. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which rules out option D.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Aliphatic Region Signals\nThe spectrum shows three signals (all singlets) in the aliphatic region (around 2.2 ppm) with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals come from the methyl (–CH3) or ethyl (–CH2CH3) groups.\n\nLet's predict the aliphatic signals for each remaining isomer:\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent. This produces **one singlet** for 12 hydrogens.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** A plane of symmetry makes the methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6 hydrogens (a 1:1 ratio).\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** A plane of symmetry makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent (6H). The methyls at C2 (3H) and C5 (3H) are each unique. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Combinations\nNow, we evaluate the remaining options by considering the combined aliphatic signals for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: one singlet (12H)\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   The mixture would show four signals (unless there is accidental overlap) with an integration ratio of 12:6:3:3 (or 4:2:1:1). This does not match the observed three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB: two singlets (6H, 6H)\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   This combination would produce up to five distinct signals. To get three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio (which corresponds to 12H, 6H, 6H for the 24 total aliphatic protons), significant and specific signal overlap would be required. While possible, it's less straightforward.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene): **one singlet (12H)**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene): **two singlets (6H and 6H)**\n    *   When mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the combined spectrum would naturally exhibit **three singlets** with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrals is **12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data without needing to assume any coincidental signal overlaps.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe combination that most directly and simply explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
