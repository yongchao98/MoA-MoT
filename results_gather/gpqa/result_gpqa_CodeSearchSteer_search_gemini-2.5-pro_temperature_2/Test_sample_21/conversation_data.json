    "The correct combination to complete the student's statement is **weaker** and **slower**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Thermodynamics: Weaker in basic solutions**\n    The strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher, more positive potential indicates a stronger oxidant. For the reduction of oxygen:\n    *   In acidic solution: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, the standard reduction potential is **+1.23 V**.\n    *   In basic solution: O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, the standard reduction potential is **+0.40 V**.\n\n    Since the reduction potential in basic solution (+0.40 V) is significantly lower than in acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidizing agent in basic conditions compared to acidic conditions.\n\n*   **Kinetics: Slower in acidic solutions**\n    The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is notoriously complex and, in most circumstances, kinetically slow or \"sluggish\". This high activation energy barrier is a major reason why catalysts, often containing platinum, are necessary for applications like fuel cells.\n\n    When comparing reaction speeds in different media, studies have shown that the kinetics of oxygen reduction can be even slower in acidic solutions than in alkaline (basic) solutions for many catalysts. For example, on certain catalysts, the presence of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) in alkaline solutions facilitates the reaction, making it kinetically faster than in acidic environments. Therefore, in a general context, the reaction of oxygen in acidic solutions is considered **slower**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the completed statement is: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
