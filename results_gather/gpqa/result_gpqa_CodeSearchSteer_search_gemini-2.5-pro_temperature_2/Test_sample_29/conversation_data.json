    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to identify the color of the light it emits.\n\n### 1. Determine the Color of Emitted Light\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The energy of a photon of light is related to its color. The visible light spectrum corresponds to a range of photon energies:\n\n*   **Violet:** ~2.75 - 3.10 eV\n*   **Blue:** ~2.50 - 2.75 eV\n*   **Green:** ~2.17 - 2.50 eV\n*   **Yellow:** ~2.10 - 2.17 eV\n*   **Orange:** ~2.00 - 2.10 eV\n*   **Red:** ~1.65 - 2.00 eV\n\nThe given energy of 2.3393 eV falls squarely within the **green** region of the visible spectrum.\n\n### 2. Find the Absorbed (Complementary) Color\nWhen a substance has a particular color, it is because it absorbs light from the complementary color in the visible spectrum and reflects or transmits the color we see. The color an object appears is complementary to the color of light it absorbs most strongly.\n\nThe complementary color pairs are:\n*   Red and Green/Cyan\n*   Blue and Yellow\n*   Violet and Yellow-Green\n\nSince the dye emits or appears **green**, it must be absorbing its complementary color. The complementary color of green is **red**. Therefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<D>>>"
