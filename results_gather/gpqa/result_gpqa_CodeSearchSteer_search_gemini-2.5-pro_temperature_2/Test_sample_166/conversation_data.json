    "To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state, we follow the provided definition of relative entropy.\n\n**1. Define the State and Parameters:**\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\nThe normalization constant is:\n`N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2))`\n\nWe are given the specific parameters:\n*   `phi = -pi / 4`\n*   `alpha = 0.5`\n\nFor `phi = -pi/4`, we have `sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1`.\nThe state becomes an \"odd\" cat state:\n`|psi> = (cos(-pi/4)|alpha> + sin(-pi/4)|-alpha>) / N = ( (1/sqrt(2))|alpha> - (1/sqrt(2))|-alpha> ) / N`\nAnd the normalization constant squared is `N^2 = 1 - exp(-2*alpha^2)`.\n\n**2. The Measure of Non-Gaussianity:**\nThe relative entropy measure is defined as:\n`del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau))`\n\nHere, `rho = |psi><psi|` is the density matrix of our state. Since `|psi>` is a pure state, its density matrix is a rank-one projector. The von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero. The entropy `S(rho) = -trace(rho * ln(rho))`, so `trace(rho * ln(rho))` is 0.\n\nThe formula for non-Gaussianity simplifies to:\n`del_b = 0 - trace(tau * ln(tau)) = S(tau)`\nwhere `S(tau) = -trace(tau * ln(tau))` is the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`.\n\n**3. Determine the Reference Gaussian State `tau`:**\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** We calculate the expectation value of the annihilation operator `a`. For the odd cat state, this value is zero: `<a> = <psi|a|psi> = 0`.\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix):** We need to calculate `<n> = <a†a>` (the average photon number) and `<a^2>`.\n    *   `<n> = |alpha|^2 * (1 + exp(-2*|alpha|^2)) / (1 - exp(-2*|alpha|^2))`\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n\n**4. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau)`:**\nThe reference state `tau` is a centered squeezed thermal state. The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is given by a function of its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`.\n`S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is determined from the second moments:\n`nu = sqrt( (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2 )`\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation:**\nNow we plug in the value `alpha = 0.5`:\n*   `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `exp(-2 * alpha^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653`\n\nFirst, calculate the average photon number `<n>`:\n*   `<n> = 0.25 * (1 + 0.60653) / (1 - 0.60653) ≈ 0.25 * (1.60653 / 0.39347) ≈ 1.0207`\n\nNext, calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n*   `nu^2 = (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2 = (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n*   `nu^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n*   `nu = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n\nFinally, calculate the entropy `S(tau)` which is our measure of non-Gaussianity:\n*   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n*   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n*   Since `ln(1) = 0`, we have:\n*   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\nThe calculated value of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.3862, which is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
