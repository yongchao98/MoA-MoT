    "Here is a step-by-p-step breakdown of the logic used to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (4 °C). This strongly suggests that B is heavy water (D₂O), which has a melting point of 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, released during the reaction, has an equal number of protons and neutrons. While several stable atoms fit this description (like Helium-4, Carbon-12, Oxygen-16), a gas molecule released from a chemical reaction is likely to be diatomic. Deuterium gas (D₂), an isotope of hydrogen, fits this description perfectly; each atom has one proton and one neutron, so the molecule (D₂) has two protons and two neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce deuterium gas (D₂) and a precipitate G. Given that D₂ is produced, liquid Y is almost certainly heavy water (D₂O). The violent reaction that releases a deuterated gas from heavy water is characteristic of a powerful deuterated reducing agent. Common powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry include metal hydrides. This points to Substance X being a deuterated complex metal hydride, such as lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). Its non-deuterated analog, lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), is known to react violently with water. The overall reaction would be:\n    LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → 4 D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)\n\n4.  **Identify Precipitate G:** The precipitate G would be aluminum hydroxide-d3 (Al(OD)₃). When heated, aluminum hydroxide decomposes to form aluminum oxide and water. In this case, Al(OD)₃ would decompose to release heavy water, D₂O (Substance B), which is consistent with the information given.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Identity of X with the Final Clue:** The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Keto acids contain both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group (for a total of at least 3 oxygen atoms). A powerful reducing agent like lithium aluminum hydride (and its deuterated analog LiAlD₄) reduces both functional groups to alcohols. The resulting product is a diol, which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that Substance X is indeed a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nHaving identified Substance X as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, we can now perform the required calculation.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** The lightest element by atomic number is hydrogen, and deuterium (D) is its isotope. There are four atoms of deuterium. The mass of a deuterium atom (one proton, one neutron) is approximately 2 amu.\n*   **Heaviest Element:** The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al). There is one atom of aluminum. The mass of the stable isotope of aluminum (²⁷Al) is approximately 27 amu.\n*   **Mass of Lightest Elements:** 4 (atoms of D) × 2 (amu/atom) = 8 amu.\n*   **Mass of Heaviest Elements:** 1 (atom of Al) × 27 (amu/atom) = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
