    "To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe population (N) of a specific energy level (E) in a gas at a certain temperature (T) is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, e^(-E/kT), where k is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nLet's denote the number of iron atoms in the specified excited state for star_1 and star_2 as N₁ and N₂ respectively. Their corresponding effective temperatures are T₁ and T₂. The energy of this excited level above the ground state is ΔE.\n\nThe population of this level in each star can be expressed as:\nFor star 1: N₁ ∝ e^(-ΔE / kT₁)\nFor star 2: N₂ ∝ e^(-ΔE / kT₂)\n\nThe problem states that the number of excited iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, meaning N₁ / N₂ = 2. We can set up the ratio of the populations:\n\nN₁ / N₂ = [e^(-ΔE / kT₁)] / [e^(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n\nUsing the property of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ), this simplifies to:\n\n2 = e^[(-ΔE / kT₁) - (-ΔE / kT₂)]\n2 = e^[(ΔE / kT₂) - (ΔE / kT₁)]\n\nWe can factor out the term (ΔE / k):\n\n2 = e^[(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\nNow, we can simplify the term in the parenthesis:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)]\n\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant (k) is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio ΔE / k is:\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation, we get:\n\nln(2) = 1 * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)]\n\nln(2) = [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)]\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
