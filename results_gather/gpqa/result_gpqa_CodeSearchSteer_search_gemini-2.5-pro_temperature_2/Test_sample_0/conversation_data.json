    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than the combined energy uncertainty of the two states. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle as it applies to energy and time. The uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) is inversely proportional to its lifetime (Δt), given by the relation ΔE ≥ ħ / (2 * Δt), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n**For the first state:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ seconds\n*   The reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / Δt₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**For the second state:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ seconds\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / Δt₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference (E₁ - E₂) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).\n\nTotal energy uncertainty ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference between the two levels must be significantly larger than this value. Let's examine the given options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than the calculated total uncertainty.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV is significantly less than the total uncertainty.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is much less than the total uncertainty.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is substantially larger than the total uncertainty of approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nThus, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV would be sufficient to clearly distinguish these two energy levels.\n\n<<<D>>>"
