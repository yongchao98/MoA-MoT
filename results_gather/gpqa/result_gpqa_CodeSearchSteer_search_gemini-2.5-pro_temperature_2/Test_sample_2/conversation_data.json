    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, we can calculate the expectation values of σz and σx separately and then combine them.\n\nThe spin state of the particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩\n\nIn matrix notation, the spin-up state |↑⟩ is represented by the column vectorᵀ, and the spin-down state |↓⟩ is represented byᵀ. Therefore, the state vector |ψ⟩ is:\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ\n\nThe Pauli matrices σz and σx are defined as:\nσz = [, [0, -1]]\nσx = [,]\n\nThe expectation value of an operator O for a state |ψ⟩ is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of σz (⟨σz⟩):**\nFirst, we find the result of applying the σz operator to the state |ψ⟩:\nσz|ψ⟩ = [, [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ = [0.5, -√3/2]ᵀ\n\nNext, we calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩. The bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩, which is [0.5, √3/2].\n⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]ᵀ\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)(0.5) + (√3/2)(-√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of σx (⟨σx⟩):**\nFirst, apply the σx operator to the state |ψ⟩:\nσx|ψ⟩ = [,] * [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ = [√3/2, 0.5]ᵀ\n\nNext, calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩:\n⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]ᵀ\n⟨σx⟩ = (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\n**3. Calculate the total expectation value:**\nThe expectation value of the combined operator 10σz + 5σx is:\n⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n⟨O⟩ = 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + (5√3)/2\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + (5 * 1.732) / 2\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 8.66 / 2\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ = -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
