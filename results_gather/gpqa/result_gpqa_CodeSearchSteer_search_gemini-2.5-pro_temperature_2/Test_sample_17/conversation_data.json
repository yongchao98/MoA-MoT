    "To find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we first need to determine the silicon abundance for each star relative to a common element, which is typically hydrogen. The abundance notation `[A/B]` is defined as `log10(n_A / n_B)_star - log10(n_A / n_B)_sun`.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the silicon abundance in Star 1\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n\nA useful property of this notation is that `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`. We can use this to find the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance `[Si/H]_1`:\n\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\nNow, we use the definition of `[Si/H]_1`:\n`[Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si / n_H)_1 - log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun = 0.3`\n\nRearranging this equation, we get the silicon-to-hydrogen number ratio for Star 1:\n`(n_Si / n_H)_1 = (n_Si / n_H)_sun * 10^0.3`\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the silicon abundance in Star 2\n\nFor Star 2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n\nWe first need to find `[Si/Mg]_2`. The relationship is `[A/B] = -[B/A]`, therefore:\n`[Si/Mg]_2 = -[Mg/Si]_2 = -0.3`\n\nNow, we can find the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance `[Si/H]_2`:\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Si/Mg]_2 + [Mg/H]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3 + 0 = -0.3`\n\nUsing the definition for `[Si/H]_2`:\n`[Si/H]_2 = log10(n_Si / n_H)_2 - log10(n_Si / n_H)_sun = -0.3`\n\nRearranging this, we get the silicon-to-hydrogen number ratio for Star 2:\n`(n_Si / n_H)_2 = (n_Si / n_H)_sun * 10^-0.3`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the ratio of silicon abundances\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. This is equivalent to the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen.\n\n`Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n\nNow substitute the expressions we found in Step 1 and Step 2:\n\n`Ratio = ( (n_Si / n_H)_sun * 10^0.3 ) / ( (n_Si / n_H)_sun * 10^-0.3 )`\n\nThe term for the Sun's silicon abundance cancels out:\n\n`Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3 = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6`\n\nCalculating the final value:\n`10^0.6 â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. Comparing this to the given options, the correct choice is B. The information about the stellar masses, LTE, the EW method, and the specific solar abundances for Iron and Magnesium were not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
