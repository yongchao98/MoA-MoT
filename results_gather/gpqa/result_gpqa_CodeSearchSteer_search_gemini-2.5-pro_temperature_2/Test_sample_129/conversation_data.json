    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of an object so that its Lyman-alpha absorption can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to determine the minimum wavelength of light that can pass through Earth's atmosphere and be observed from the ground.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength (λ_rest) in the vacuum ultraviolet part of the spectrum, at approximately 1216 Å (or 121.6 nm). Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, absorbs most of the incoming ultraviolet radiation. This atmospheric absorption creates a \"cutoff,\" preventing wavelengths shorter than a certain limit from reaching ground-based telescopes.\n\nWhile highly specialized instruments can detect light down to an absolute atmospheric cutoff of about 300-320 nm (3000-3200 Å), the practical and more efficient window for \"optical\" ground-based telescopes begins at slightly longer wavelengths, often corresponding to the standard astronomical U-band (Ultraviolet) filter. For an object's Lyman-alpha absorption feature to be readily detectable, it must be redshifted to a wavelength well within this observable window. A practical wavelength for this lower limit would be around 3500 Å.\n\nThe relationship between rest wavelength (λ_rest), observed wavelength (λ_observed), and redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n\nλ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\nTo find the required redshift, we can solve for z:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\nUsing the Lyman-alpha rest wavelength of 1216 Å and setting the minimum observable wavelength to 3500 Å, we can calculate the redshift:\n\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.878 - 1\nz ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculated redshift of approximately 1.88 is a reasonable lower limit. A redshift of 1.9 would shift the Lyman-alpha line to:\n\nλ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 Å * 2.9 = 3526.4 Å\n\nThis wavelength falls within the observable range of ground-based optical telescopes. Among the given options, 1.9 is the best estimate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
