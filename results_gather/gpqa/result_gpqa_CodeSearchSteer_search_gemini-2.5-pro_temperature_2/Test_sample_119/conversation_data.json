    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, let's break down the relationship between star counts, distance, and parallax. This explanation assumes a uniform spatial distribution of stars.\n\n### Derivation Steps:\n\n1.  **Number of Stars and Volume**: If stars are distributed uniformly in space, the number of stars (`N`) within a given volume (`V`) is proportional to that volume. The number density of stars, ρ (rho), is constant.\n\n2.  **Volume of a Spherical Shell**: Consider the stars within a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from the observer, with a thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² dd`\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell**: The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is the density `ρ` times the volume `dV`.\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n    *   This shows that the number of stars in a thin shell of constant thickness increases with the square of the distance.\n\n4.  **Relating Distance and Parallax**: Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`). Using parsecs for distance and arcseconds for parallax, the relationship is:\n    *   `d = 1 / plx`\n\n5.  **Relating Differential Elements**: To find the number of stars per unit of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`), we need to relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to the interval of parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    *   `dd / d(plx) = -1 / plx²`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship, so `|dd| = d(plx) / plx²`.\n\n6.  **Combining the Equations**: Now we can find the expression for the number of stars per unit parallax range (`dN/d(plx)`) using the chain rule: `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx))`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions from steps 3 and 5:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (ρ * 4πd²) * (1 / plx²)`\n    *   Finally, substitute `d = 1/plx` to express everything in terms of parallax:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (ρ * 4π * (1/plx)²) * (1 / plx²)`\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ / plx²) * (1 / plx²)`\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`. A 1979 paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society confirms that for a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number per unit parallax interval is proportional to 1/π⁴ (where π represents parallax).\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is that the number of stars per unit parallax range varies as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
