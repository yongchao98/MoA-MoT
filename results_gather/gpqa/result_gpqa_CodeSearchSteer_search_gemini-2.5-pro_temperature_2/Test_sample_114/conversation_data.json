    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of energy and momentum in an electron-positron annihilation. When an electron and a positron collide, they annihilate each other, converting their mass and kinetic energy into high-energy photons. The total energy and momentum of the system before the collision must equal the total energy and momentum of the photons produced after the collision.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the angle between the two resulting photons:\n\n### 1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum\nFirst, we determine the total energy and momentum of the electron-positron system before the collision. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light. The relativistic momentum is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n\n**Electron:**\n*   Rest mass: `m_e`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`\n*   Energy: `E_e = 4 * m_e * c²`\n*   Momentum: `p_e = m_e * c * √(4² - 1) = m_e * c * √15`. The momentum is directed along the positive horizontal axis.\n\n**Positron:**\n*   Rest mass: `m_e` (same as electron)\n*   Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`\n*   Energy: `E_p = 2 * m_e * c²`\n*   Momentum: `p_p = m_e * c * √(2² - 1) = m_e * c * √3`. The positron is moving from the right, so its momentum is in the opposite direction, along the negative horizontal axis.\n\n**Total Energy and Momentum Before Collision:**\n*   Total Energy `E_total = E_e + E_p = 4m_ec² + 2m_ec² = 6m_ec²`.\n*   Total Momentum `P_total = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3)m_ec`. Since `√15` (approx. 3.87) is greater than `√3` (approx. 1.73), the net momentum is positive, directed to the right.\n\n### 2. Final State: Energy and Momentum of Photons\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced. The problem states they have the same energy, let's call it `E_γ`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the two photons must equal the total initial energy.\n    `2 * E_γ = E_total = 6m_ec²`\n    Therefore, the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3m_ec²`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the two photons must equal the total initial momentum. The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_ec`.\n    The initial particles moved only along the horizontal (x-axis), so there was no initial vertical momentum. By conservation, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. This is achieved if the two photons are emitted at symmetric angles `θ` and `-θ` with respect to the horizontal axis.\n\n    The total horizontal momentum of the photons is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum:\n    `P_γ_total = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`\n    Substituting `p_γ = 3m_ec`, we get:\n    `P_γ_total = 2 * (3m_ec) * cos(θ) = 6m_ec * cos(θ)`\n\n### 3. Solving for the Angle\nBy equating the total momentum before and after the collision, we can solve for the angle `θ`.\n`P_total = P_γ_total`\n`(√15 - √3)m_ec = 6m_ec * cos(θ)`\n\nWe can cancel `m_ec` from both sides:\n`√15 - √3 = 6 * cos(θ)`\n`cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n`cos(θ) ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205) / 6 ≈ 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.35682`\n`θ = arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons, which is `2θ`.\nAngle = `2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<C>>>"
