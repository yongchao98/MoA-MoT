    "This is a classic problem of exponential decay, which is characteristic of radioactive decay. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Memoryless Property:** Radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability. We only need to calculate the probability that a new atom would decay in 150 minutes.\n\n2.  **Define Survival Probability:** Let S(t) be the probability that the atom survives for a time t. The decay process follows an exponential law:\n    S(t) = e<sup>-λt</sup>\n    where λ is the decay constant.\n\n3.  **Use Given Data to Find λ:** The probability of decay within a time t is P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e<sup>-λt</sup>.\n    We are given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    P(100) = 1 - e<sup>-λ * 100</sup> = 0.32\n    From this, we can determine the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n    e<sup>-λ * 100</sup> = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is simply P(150).\n    P(150) = 1 - e<sup>-λ * 150</sup>\n\n5.  **Solve for the Probability:** We can relate e<sup>-λ * 150</sup> to our known value of e<sup>-λ * 100</sup>:\n    e<sup>-λ * 150</sup> = e<sup>(-λ * 100) * 1.5</sup> = (e<sup>-λ * 100</sup>)<sup>1.5</sup>\n    Substituting the value from step 3:\n    e<sup>-λ * 150</sup> = (0.68)<sup>1.5</sup>\n\n    Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    (0.68)<sup>1.5</sup> = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\n    Finally, we find the decay probability for 150 minutes:\n    P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
