    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituent on each benzene ring.\n\nFirst, we can separate the substituents into two main categories: those that direct the incoming electrophile to the *meta* position and those that direct to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n\n**Meta-Directing Groups (Deactivating)**\nThese groups withdraw electron density from the benzene ring, making electrophilic substitution slower and directing the incoming bromine to the meta position. As a result, they will produce the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The substituents in this category are:\n*   **4) -NO2 (in C6H5-NO2, Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group is a very strong deactivating, meta-directing group. It will produce a very small amount of para product, typically less than 1%.\n*   **6) -COOH (in C6H5-COOH, Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. The major product of its bromination is m-bromobenzoic acid. It is less deactivating than the nitro group, so it will produce a slightly higher yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **2) -COOC2H5 (in C6H5-COOC2H5, Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group is also a deactivating, meta-directing group. It is generally considered less deactivating than a carboxylic acid, thus allowing for a slightly higher yield of the para-isomer compared to benzoic acid. For example, some nitration data shows the benzoic ester giving predominantly meta-nitro product (73%) accompanied by ortho (22%) and para (5%) isomers.\n\nBased on the deactivating strength (NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5), the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\nThese groups either donate electron density to the ring (activating) or are halogens (deactivating, but o,p-directing). They produce significantly higher yields of the para-isomer. The final ratio of ortho to para product is largely determined by steric hindrance; bulkier groups will favor the formation of the less-hindered para-isomer. The substituents in this category are:\n*   **1) -CH3 (in C6H5-CH3, Toluene):** The methyl group is an activating, ortho, para-directing group. Due to its relatively small size, it allows for a substantial amount of ortho substitution. In bromination, the para isomer is generally the major product, but the ortho isomer is also significant.\n*   **5) -C2H5 (in C6H5-C2H5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is also an activating, ortho, para-directing group. Being bulkier than the methyl group, it causes greater steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n*   **3) -Cl (in C6H5-Cl, Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group is deactivating overall but is ortho, para-directing due to resonance. Halogens are known to strongly favor the para position over the ortho position in electrophilic aromatic substitution, often more so than small alkyl groups. This is due to a combination of steric and electronic factors that disfavor attack at the ortho position.\n\nComparing the ortho, para-directors, the increasing steric hindrance from -CH3 to -C2H5 will increase the para-isomer yield. The -Cl group consistently gives a very high yield of the para product. Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Final Order**\nBy combining the two groups, we establish the complete sequence. The meta-directing substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\nThe complete order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
