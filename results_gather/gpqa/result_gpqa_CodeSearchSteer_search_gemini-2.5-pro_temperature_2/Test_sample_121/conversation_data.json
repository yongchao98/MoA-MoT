    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reactions and the determination of the final product's structure and its corresponding 1H NMR signals.\n\n### **Reaction Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid + Bromine, Pyridine, Acetic Anhydride**\n    This reaction is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + Ethanol, H₂SO₄**\n    This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + Sodium Cyanide (NaCN)**\n    The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion from the α-carbon in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 + excess Sodium Hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane**\n    Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent electron-withdrawing cyano and ester groups. The resulting carbanion then acts as a nucleophile.\n    *   First, one equivalent of NaH removes a proton: NC-CH⁻-COOEt.\n    *   This anion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane: NC-CH( (CH₂)₅Br )-COOEt.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, the remaining α-proton is also removed, forming a new carbanion: NC-C⁻( (CH₂)₅Br )-COOEt.\n    *   This anion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction (cyclization), attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion to form a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of the Final Product**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n*   **The Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry. This absence of symmetry means that protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation will be chemically non-equivalent.\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation and will produce **one signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-CH₂-) are equivalent due to free rotation and will produce a **second signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The ring contains five methylene (-CH₂-) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n        *   On any single one of these carbons (e.g., C2), the two protons (one axial and one equatorial) are diastereotopic, meaning they are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. Thus, each methylene group on the ring will give rise to two distinct signals.\n        *   Since there is no plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are not equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 are not equivalent to those on C5.\n        *   Therefore, all 10 hydrogens on the cyclohexane ring are in unique chemical environments.\n            *   C2 protons → 2 signals\n            *   C3 protons → 2 signals\n            *   C4 protons → 2 signals\n            *   C5 protons → 2 signals\n            *   C6 protons → 2 signals\n        *   This gives a total of **10 signals** from the ring protons.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring: 2 (ethyl) + 10 (ring) = 12 signals.\n\nThere will be a total of 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
