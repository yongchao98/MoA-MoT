    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in product 3.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde. The structure is a benzene ring attached to a propenal chain (C6H5-CH=CH-CHO). It has 9 carbon atoms (6 in the phenyl ring, 2 in the double bond, and 1 in the aldehyde group).\n*   **Reagent:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr) is a Grignard reagent. In this reaction, the nucleophilic methyl group from the Grignard reagent attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde.\n*   **Product 1:** This reaction results in the formation of a secondary alcohol. One carbon atom from the methylmagnesium bromide is added to the cinnamaldehyde structure. The product, 1-phenyl-1-buten-3-ol, has 10 carbon atoms (9 from cinnamaldehyde + 1 from the methyl group).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (1-phenyl-1-buten-3-ol) is a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is an oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols into ketones.\n*   **Product 2:** The secondary alcohol group in product 1 is oxidized to a ketone, forming 1-phenyl-1-buten-3-one. This reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms. Therefore, product 2 still contains 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (1-phenyl-1-buten-3-one) is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, also known as dimethylsulfoxonium methylide or the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent, is a sulfur ylide.\n*   **Reaction:** The question notes there is a typo and should state that product 2 is treated, not \"3 was treated\". The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent reacts with ketones to form epoxides. The reagent adds a methylene (CH₂) group to form an epoxide ring at the location of the former carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** This reaction adds one carbon atom to the structure of product 2. Therefore, product 3 contains 11 carbon atoms (10 from product 2 + 1 from the ylide). It is important to note that when reacting with α,β-unsaturated ketones, a different sulfur ylide (dimethylsulfonium methylide) would result in cyclopropanation; however, the specified reagent, dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, favors the formation of an epoxide at the carbonyl group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFollowing the reaction sequence:\n*   Cinnamaldehyde: 9 carbons\n*   Product 1: 9 + 1 = 10 carbons\n*   Product 2: 10 carbons\n*   Product 3: 10 + 1 = 11 carbons\n\nThe final product, product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
