    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must first establish the limiting apparent magnitude for the required signal-to-noise ratio and exposure time. The condition for detection is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour (3600 seconds) exposure.\n\n### ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude\n\nA technical paper on ESPRESSO's on-sky performance provides estimates for the signal-to-noise ratio. A figure in a 2024 paper, originally from a 2014 publication, shows the expected S/N versus stellar apparent V magnitude for different exposure times. For a 3600-second exposure in singleHR mode, a S/N of 10 is achieved for a star with an apparent V magnitude of approximately 16.3. Another paper states the limiting magnitude in a specific high-resolution mode (HR42) is around V ~ 18 mag. Given the information, we can conservatively take the limiting magnitude to be around V = 16.\n\nWe will now evaluate each star to see if it is detectable under these conditions.\n\n### a) Canopus\nCanopus (Alpha Carinae) is the second brightest star in the night sky. Its apparent visual magnitude is approximately -0.74. As one of the brightest stars, Canopus is easily detectable by ESPRESSO, far exceeding the S/N requirement in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### b) Polaris\nPolaris (Alpha Ursae Minoris) has an apparent magnitude that fluctuates around 1.98. However, its visibility from the Paranal Observatory in Chile is a key factor. Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees. A star is only visible if its declination is greater than the observer's latitude minus 90 degrees. For Paranal, this means the star's declination must be greater than -24.6° - 90° = -114.6°, which is always true. More importantly, for a star to be observable it must rise above the horizon. The maximum altitude of a star is 90° - |observer's latitude - star's declination|. A star is never visible if its declination is more northern than 90° minus the absolute value of the latitude.\n\nThe latitude of Paranal is approximately -24.6°. Therefore, the northern limit for a star to be visible is a declination of + (90° - 24.6°) = +65.4°. Polaris has a declination of about +89° 15′ 51″. Since +89.26° is much greater than +65.4°, Polaris is never visible from Paranal Observatory and is therefore not detectable.\n\n### c) Star at 10 pc\nThis star has an absolute V magnitude (M_V) of 15 and is located at a distance (d) of 10 parsecs. We can calculate its apparent V magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula:\n\nm_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5\nm_V = 15\n\nAn apparent magnitude of 15 is brighter than the limiting magnitude of V ≈ 16.3 for an S/N of 10 in a 1-hour exposure. Therefore, this star is detectable.\n\n### d) Star at 200 pc\nThis star has an absolute V magnitude of 15 and is at a distance of 200 parsecs.\n\nm_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 5 * (2.301) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 11.505 - 5\nm_V = 21.5\n\nAn apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the limiting magnitude. This star is not detectable.\n\n### e) Star at 5 pc\nThis star has an absolute V magnitude of 15 and is at a distance of 5 parsecs.\n\nm_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 5 * (0.699) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 3.495 - 5\nm_V = 13.5\n\nAn apparent magnitude of 13.5 is significantly brighter than the limiting magnitude. This star is detectable.\n\n### f) Star at 50 pc\nThis star has an absolute V magnitude of 15 and is at a distance of 50 parsecs.\n\nm_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 5 * (1.699) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 8.495 - 5\nm_V = 18.5\n\nAn apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the limiting magnitude of V ≈ 16.3, although close to the V~18 limit for some modes. Given the S/N=10 in 1 hour condition points to V=16.3, this star is likely not detectable under the specified conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on this analysis, the detectable stars are:\n*   **Canopus** (m_V = -0.74)\n*   **Star at 10 pc** (m_V = 15)\n*   **Star at 5 pc** (m_V = 13.5)\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
