    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho, para-directing activator. The reaction yields a mixture of *ortho*-nitrotoluene and *para*-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product is *para*-nitrotoluene, which will be considered as **Product 1**.\n\n**Product 1:** *p*-Nitrotoluene\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group of *p*-nitrotoluene. While strong oxidizing conditions can convert a methyl group to a carboxylic acid, the use of manganese dioxide (MnO₂), even with sulfuric acid, can be controlled to stop at the aldehyde stage. This interpretation is the most chemically plausible to form a stable Product 3 in the subsequent step. Therefore, the methyl group is oxidized to an aldehyde group.\n\n**Product 2:** *p*-Nitrobenzaldehyde\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which is a type of crossed aldol condensation. *p*-Nitrobenzaldehyde, which has no α-hydrogens, reacts with the enolate of acetone, formed by the action of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The initial aldol addition product readily dehydrates to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\nThe reaction sequence is:\n1.  NaOH removes an α-hydrogen from acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n3.  The resulting intermediate is protonated to form an aldol.\n4.  This aldol dehydrates to form the final product, **Product 3**, which is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we must analyze the symmetry elements of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   The structure consists of a *para*-substituted benzene ring attached to a but-3-en-2-one chain.\n*   The entire conjugated system, including the benzene ring, the nitro group (NO₂), the C=C double bond, and the C=O group, tends to be planar to maximize π-orbital overlap.\n*   Assuming this planarity, this molecular plane acts as a **mirror plane (σ)**. If we consider the rotation of the methyl group, it is possible to have one of its hydrogen atoms in this plane, making the other two symmetric with respect to the plane.\n*   There is no center of inversion (i).\n*   There are no proper rotation axes (Cₙ, where n>1). The molecule is not symmetric enough for a C₂ axis due to the difference between the nitro group and the butenone substituent, and the asymmetry within the butenone chain itself.\n\nSince the molecule's only symmetry element (other than the identity element, E) is a single mirror plane, its point group is **Cₛ**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   **A) Cₛ:** Correct. The molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry.\n*   **B) D₂h:** Incorrect. This group requires high symmetry, including three perpendicular C₂ axes and three mirror planes.\n*   **C) C₂h:** Incorrect. This group requires a C₂ axis and a center of inversion, neither of which are present.\n*   **D) C₃:** Incorrect. This requires a three-fold axis of rotation, which is absent.\n\n<<<A>>>"
