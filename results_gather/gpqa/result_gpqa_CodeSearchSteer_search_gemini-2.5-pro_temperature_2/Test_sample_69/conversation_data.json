    "This is a complex chemical riddle that relies on recognizing a specific, and somewhat obscure, set of chemical reactions. Deduction from first principles is difficult due to several apparent contradictions within the problem statement. However, by piecing together the most chemically plausible steps and identifying the likely intended \"trick\" in the puzzle, a solution can be reached.\n\n1.  **Reaction 3 is the most revealing clue**: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`. The disproportionation of an iodine(I) compound in water is a classic reaction that produces the original element (or another form of it) plus two acids, one strong and one weak. The hydrolysis of iodine monochloride (`ICl`) produces `I₂`, iodic acid (`HIO₃`), and hydrochloric acid (`HCl`). Both resulting acids are strong, which contradicts the prompt. However, the hydrolysis of a compound like iodine monofluoride (`IF`) would yield iodine (`I₂`), iodic acid (`HIO₃`, a strong acid), and hydrofluoric acid (`HF`, a weak acid). This perfectly matches the clue. Thus, we can deduce:\n    *   **A = I₂** (Iodine)\n    *   **C = IF** (Iodine monofluoride) or a related compound containing iodine and fluorine where iodine is in the +1 oxidation state.\n    *   **F = HIO₃** (Iodic acid)\n    *   **G = HF** (Hydrofluoric acid)\n\n2.  **Identifying Gas B**: Since C (`IF`) is formed from solid A (`I₂`) and gas B, gas B must be **F₂ (Fluorine)**.\n\n3.  **Identifying D and H**: Gas D reacts with gas B (`F₂`) in a 1:1 ratio to form solvent H. The most plausible reaction among simple gases that fits this is the reaction between krypton and fluorine.\n    *   **D = Kr** (Krypton)\n    *   **B = F₂** (Fluorine)\n    *   **H = KrF₂** (Krypton difluoride)\n    The description of H as a \"solvent\" is likely a misleading part of the riddle, as `KrF₂` is a solid that is used as a powerful fluorinating agent, often in a different solvent.\n\n4.  **Identifying Product E**: Product E is formed when C (`IF`) reacts with 2 equivalents of D (`Kr`). This step is not a standard, well-documented reaction. It appears to be another misleading part of the riddle. A common \"trick\" in such riddles is that a later reaction actually produces one of the previously identified substances. The most plausible extremely hazardous product among the identified species is **`KrF₂`**. `KrF₂` is a volatile solid, a powerful and unstable oxidizing agent, and thus \"extremely hazardous\". We assume E is identical to H. Krypton difluoride (`KrF₂`) is a linear molecule (F-Kr-F).\n\n5.  **Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E**: The product E is identified as `KrF₂`. Being a linear molecule with a center of inversion, its molecular symmetry point group is **D∞h**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
