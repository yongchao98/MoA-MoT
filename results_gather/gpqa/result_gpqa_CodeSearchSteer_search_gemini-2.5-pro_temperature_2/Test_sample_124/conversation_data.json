    "The physical system described is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n\n`E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω`\n\nHere, `n` is the principal quantum number, which can be any non-negative integer (`n = 0, 1, 2, ...`). It is the sum of the quantum numbers for each of the three dimensions (`n = n_x + n_y + n_z`).\n\nThe energy levels are as follows:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** This is the lowest energy level. The energy is `E_0 = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω`.\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** This is the next energy level. The energy is `E_1 = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω`.\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** The energy for this state is `E_2 = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω`.\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** The energy for the third excited state is `E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω`.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level `E_n` is known as the degeneracy of that level. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy `g_n` is given by the formula:\n\n`g_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2`\n\nFor the third excited state, `n = 3`. We can calculate its degeneracy:\n\n`g_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4)(5) / 2 = 10`\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions associated with this energy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
