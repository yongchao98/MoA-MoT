    "The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star, assuming random orbital inclinations and a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_s`) to the planet's semi-major axis (`a`).\n\n*   **Transit Probability (p):** `p = R_s / a`\n\nThe semi-major axis (`a`) is related to the orbital period (`P`) and the mass of the host star (`M_s`) by Kepler's Third Law. For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star, the law can be expressed as:\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** `P² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_s)) * a³`\n\nFrom this, we can solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\n`a³ ≈ (G * M_s * P²) / 4π²`\n`a ≈ ( (G * M_s * P²) / 4π² )^(1/3)`\n\nThis shows that the semi-major axis `a` is proportional to the cube root of the stellar mass and the square of the period: `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`.\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship back into the transit probability formula:\n\n`p ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\nTo find which planet is more likely to be observed transiting, we can calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, `p1 / p2`.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Radius of Star 1 equals Radius of Star 2: `R_s1 = R_s2`\n*   Mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`\n*   Period of Planet 1 is one-third the period of Planet 2: `P1 = P2 / 3`\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe ratio of probabilities is:\n`p1 / p2 = [ R_s1 / (M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3) ] / [ R_s2 / (M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3) ]`\n\nWe can rearrange this to:\n`p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * ( (M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²) )^(1/3)`\n`p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n*   `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n*   `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1 / 2`\n*   `P2 / P1 = 3`\n\n`p1 / p2 = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)`\n`p1 / p2 = (3² / 2)^(1/3)`\n`p1 / p2 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`p1 / p2 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n`p1 / p2 ≈ 1.65096`\n\nThe transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than for Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
