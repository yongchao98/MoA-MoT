    "### Evaluating the Statements\n\nThe core of the problem is a dual-catalyst system that uses only ethylene as a feedstock to produce branched polyethylene. This is achieved through a tandem catalysis approach where one catalyst oligomerizes ethylene into α-olefins (e.g., 1-hexene, 1-octene), and a second catalyst copolymerizes these *in situ*-generated α-olefins with the remaining ethylene.\n\n**A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\n\nSearch results confirm that industrial processes for the selective oligomerization of ethylene are in operation. Specifically, Phillips (now Chevron Phillips Chemical) industrialized ethylene trimerization to produce 1-hexene in 2003. These α-olefins are crucial comonomers for producing Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE). Dual catalyst systems, sometimes in tandem reactor setups, are also described in patents for producing polyethylene with tailored properties like specific branching distributions. This strongly suggests such advanced, integrated systems are used industrially.\n\n**B) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n\nGroup VIa corresponds to Group 6 of the periodic table, which includes Chromium (Cr). The search results extensively discuss the use of chromium-based catalysts for the selective oligomerization of ethylene to produce 1-hexene and 1-octene. These catalysts are often comprised of a chromium source (e.g., Cr(acac)₃), a specific ligand (often a PNP-type ligand), and an activator. In fact, this type of catalyst is central to the industrial processes mentioned above. This statement is therefore correct.\n\n**C) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n\nLate transition metals, which include noble metals like Palladium (Pd), are known to catalyze ethylene oligomerization. However, a key breakthrough for producing alpha-olefins from alternative feedstocks involved developing a non-noble bimetallic catalyst to replace an expensive noble-metal (Pd/C) based system. The cost of the ethylene oligomerization step is also noted as a concern in other contexts. While technically feasible, the high cost of noble metals is a known drawback for large-scale industrial applications compared to more cost-effective metals like chromium or nickel.\n\n**D) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n\nThe \"essential additional reaction step\" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene. The statement claims aluminum-based activators are ineffective for this. However, the scientific literature overwhelmingly shows the opposite. Aluminum-based activators, particularly methylaluminoxane (MAO) and other alkylaluminum compounds, are essential components for activating the chromium-based catalysts used for selective ethylene oligomerization. Research papers frequently describe catalyst systems as a combination of a chromium precursor, a ligand, and an aluminum-based activator like MAO. In fact, the type of aluminum activator used has a significant impact on catalytic performance and selectivity. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, statement B is the most accurate and well-supported fact among the choices. Chromium (a Group VIa metal) catalysts with specific activators are the cornerstone of modern selective ethylene oligomerization to form the α-olefins needed for this type of branched polymer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
