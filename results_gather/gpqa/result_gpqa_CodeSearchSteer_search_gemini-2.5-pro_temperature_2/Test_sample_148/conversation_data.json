    "The observations strongly suggest that the crude compound is a mixture of two distinct, but closely related, isomers that have the same mass. Here is a breakdown of the evidence and how it points to the correct conclusion:\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Evidence:** The presence of two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and a combined integral of one proton, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Because these two environments are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio, it implies a mixture of two species.\n*   **LC-MS Evidence:** The liquid chromatography (LC) results confirm the presence of two separate chemical species, as they are resolved into two distinct peaks. The mass spectrometry (MS) data, showing that both peaks have the same mass consistent with the expected product, proves that these two species are isomers.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on these facts:\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same mass and molecular formula but different three-dimensional arrangements. This difference in arrangement gives them distinct physical and chemical properties. Consequently, diastereomers will have different NMR spectra and can be separated by standard liquid chromatography. This option aligns perfectly with all the observations. In peptide synthesis, diastereomers can commonly form through epimerization (the change in stereochemistry at one chiral center of an amino acid) or through the existence of stable rotamers (atropisomers), which are isomers resulting from hindered rotation around a bond, such as the cis-trans isomers of an amide bond. Both epimers and rotamers are types of diastereomers.\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a vague term, but it would likely imply the addition of an extra amino acid, which would result in a product with a different, higher mass. This contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the expected mass.\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass than the final product. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror-image isomers. In an achiral environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties, including identical NMR spectra and co-elution (a single peak) on a standard (achiral) LC column. To separate them or see distinct NMR signals, chiral conditions (like a chiral LC column or a chiral NMR solvent) would be required, which are not mentioned. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two separable isomers with the same mass and distinct NMR spectra is a classic sign of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
