    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of quantum mechanics. The probability of measuring a certain value (an eigenvalue) of an observable is found by projecting the state vector of the system onto the corresponding eigenvector of the observable's operator.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   The state of the system at time t is given by the vector:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ\n    ```\n*   The observable is represented by the matrix P:\n    ```\n      [ 0,  1/√2,   0  ]\n    P = [1/√2,   0,  1/√2]\n      [ 0,  1/√2,   0  ]\n    ```\n**2. Find the eigenvalues of the operator P:**\nThe possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator P. We find them by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `λ` represents the eigenvalues.\n\n```\ndet(P - λI) = det | -λ,  1/√2,    0   |\n                   |1/√2,   -λ,   1/√2 |\n                   |  0,   1/√2,   -λ   |\n```\n\nThe determinant is calculated as:\n`= -λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0)`\n`= -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2)`\n`= -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2`\n`= -λ³ + λ`\n`= λ(1 - λ²)`\n\nSetting the determinant to zero, `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`, gives the eigenvalues:\n`λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, `λ = -1`.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of the measurement yielding the value 0, which is one of the eigenvalues.\n\n**3. Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0:**\nWe need to find the vector `|φ₀⟩` such that `P|φ₀⟩ = 0|φ₀⟩ = 0`. Let `|φ₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n\n```\n  [ 0,  1/√2,   0  ] [x]   [0]\n  [1/√2,   0,  1/√2] [y] = [0]\n  [ 0,  1/√2,   0  ] [z]   [0]\n```\nFrom the first and third rows, we get `(1/√2)y = 0`, which implies `y = 0`.\nFrom the second row, we get `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which implies `x + z = 0`, or `x = -z`.\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to λ = 0 is of the form `[k, 0, -k]ᵀ`. For simplicity, we can choose `k=1`, giving the unnormalized eigenvector:\n`|φ₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`\n\n**4. Calculate the probability:**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨φ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨φ|φ⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\nWhere `⟨φ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the eigenvector `φ` and the state vector `ψ`.\n\nFirst, let's compute the components:\n*   The inner product `⟨φ₀|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨φ₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`\n*   The squared magnitude `|⟨φ₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`.\n\n*   The squared norm of the eigenvector `⟨φ₀|φ₀⟩`:\n    `⟨φ₀|φ₀⟩ = (1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n*   The squared norm of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the probability formula:\n`Prob(λ=0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) \\sqrt{2/3}\nB) 1/3\nC) 1\nD) 2/3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
