    "### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTo determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we analyze the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, typically requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) that can migrate.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Without an α-hydrogen, keto-enol tautomerism cannot occur.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons between the ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have two hydrogen atoms. These α-hydrogens are acidic and can be removed, allowing the compound to tautomerize into its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic.\n\nTherefore, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nFor a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, it must be chiral, which most commonly means it has a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a methyl group (-CH₃), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and an ester group (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center and is not a meso compound, it exists as a pair of optical isomers (enantiomers), often designated as L and D forms.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a trans-isomer. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry through the C=C double bond, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Because it is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** will show optical isomerism.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
