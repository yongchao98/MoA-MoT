    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under several key assumptions that describe an idealized scenario for space-charge-limited current (SCLC). Analyzing the options based on the fundamental principles of SCLC provides the correct conditions for the equation's validity.\n\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that the current is carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). This condition makes option A, which specifies a two-carrier device, incorrect.\n*   **Trap-Free:** The ideal Mott-Gurney law applies to a semiconductor or insulator that is free of traps, which are energy states within the bandgap that can immobilize charge carriers. If traps are present, the current-voltage relationship changes, and a different model (like the Mark-Helfrich equation) is needed. This supports options C and D.\n*   **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** For the current to be limited by the space charge within the device, the injecting electrode must be able to supply an unlimited number of carriers. This requires a perfect Ohmic contact, which is defined as a contact with no energy barrier to carrier injection. A Schottky contact, mentioned in option B, is a rectifying contact that typically has an injection barrier, making it unsuitable for ideal SCLC. The phrase \"no carrier injection barrier\" in option C is synonymous with an ideal Ohmic contact.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current (Negligible Diffusion):** The Mott-Gurney model is derived assuming that the current is driven by the electric field (drift) and that the current component from the diffusion of carriers due to concentration gradients is negligible. This assumption directly contradicts option D, which incorrectly states that the drift current is negligible. In reality, SCLC is a drift-dominated phenomenon.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement C provides the most accurate and complete set of conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
