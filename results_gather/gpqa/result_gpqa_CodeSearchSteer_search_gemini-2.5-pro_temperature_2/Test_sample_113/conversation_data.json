    "Here is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the correct reagents.\n\n### Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The process involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate, which must be protonated to yield the final product, an α-hydroxy nitrile.\n\nFor this protonation step, a proton source is required. While hydrogen cyanide (HCN) itself can act as the proton donor, the reaction is often facilitated by the addition of an acid after the initial nucleophilic attack or by creating HCN *in situ*. One common laboratory procedure involves using a sodium cyanide solution and then adding a strong acid like H₂SO₄ or, as represented by H₃O⁺, an aqueous strong acid. This ensures the protonation of the intermediate to form the stable cyanohydrin product.\n\n*   **A = H₃O⁺:** This represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution, which is a suitable reagent to protonate the alkoxide intermediate and complete the cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **A = NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite is typically used for the purification of aldehydes and ketones, not as a reagent in this synthesis.\n\nTherefore, **A = H₃O⁺** is the appropriate choice.\n\n### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base upon heating.\n\nThe common methods for nitrile hydrolysis are:\n*   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Heating the nitrile with a strong aqueous acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This directly produces the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Heating the nitrile with a strong base, like sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which forms a carboxylate salt. A subsequent step of adding a strong acid is then needed to obtain the carboxylic acid.\n\nComparing the options for reagent B:\n*   **B = HCl:** This is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used for the direct hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids when heated with water.\n*   **B = CH₃COOH:** Acetic acid is a weak acid and would not be effective in promoting the hydrolysis of the nitrile, which requires harsh conditions.\n\nTherefore, **B = HCl** is the most suitable reagent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions, the correct set of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<B>>>"
