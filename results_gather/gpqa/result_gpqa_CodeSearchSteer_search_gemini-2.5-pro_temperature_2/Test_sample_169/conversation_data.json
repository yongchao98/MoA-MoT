    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, &lt;S_y&gt;, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Normalize the spin state**: The given spin state is a vector |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4). We first need to find the normalization constant, A, such that A*|ψ⟩ is a unit vector.\n    *   The squared magnitude of the state is |3i|² + |4|² = (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.\n    *   The normalization constant is A = 1/√(25) = 1/5.\n    *   The normalized spin state is |χ⟩ = (1/5) * (3i, 4).\n\n2.  **Define the spin operator S_y**: The spin operator S_y is related to the Pauli sigma matrix σ_y by S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y.\n    *   Given σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], the operator is S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value**: The expectation value &lt;S_y&gt; is calculated using the formula &lt;χ|S_y|χ⟩, where &lt;χ| is the conjugate transpose of |χ⟩.\n    *   The ket vector is |χ⟩ = (1/5) * [3i, 4]ᵀ (as a column vector).\n    *   The bra vector is &lt;χ| = (1/5) * [-3i, 4] (as a row vector).\n\nNow, we compute the product &lt;χ|S_y|χ⟩:\n*   &lt;S_y&gt; = (1/5) * [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] ) * ( (1/5) * [3i, 4]ᵀ )\n*   &lt;S_y&gt; = (ħ/50) * [-3i, 4] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]ᵀ\n*   First, multiply the matrix and the column vector:\n    [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]ᵀ = [(0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4)]ᵀ = [-4i, -3]ᵀ\n*   Next, multiply the row vector by the resulting column vector:\n    [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]ᵀ = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i² - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.\n*   Finally, multiply by the constant factor:\n    &lt;S_y&gt; = (ħ/50) * (-24) = -24ħ/50 = -12ħ/25.\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<A>>>"
