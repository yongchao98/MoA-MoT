    "The \"impulse approximation\" simplifies complex nuclear interactions by making several key assumptions about how a probe (like a lepton in an electroweak interaction) interacts with a nucleon inside a nucleus. This approximation is foundational to models like the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). The core idea is to treat the interaction as a simple, quasi-free event.\n\nThe assumptions that collectively imply this approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the \"one-body\" assumption, which posits that the interaction happens with a single nucleon, while the other (A-1) nucleons in the nucleus are merely spectators. This reduces the complex many-body problem to a much simpler single-body interaction.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption means that neither the incoming probe nor the struck nucleon interacts with the rest of the nucleus on their way in or out. This is known as the neglect of Final State Interactions (FSI). While more advanced models reintroduce these interactions, their absence is a key feature of the basic impulse approximation.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** A central tenet of the impulse approximation is that the interaction occurs over such a short timescale that the binding energy of the nucleon to the nucleus is negligible compared to the energy transferred in the collision. This allows the nucleon to be treated as a \"free\" particle during the interaction.\n\nAssumption 3, concerning the relativistic state of quarks within a nucleon, is not a standard assumption for the impulse approximation. This approximation operates at the level of nucleons, not their internal constituents. Therefore, the joint assumptions that define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
