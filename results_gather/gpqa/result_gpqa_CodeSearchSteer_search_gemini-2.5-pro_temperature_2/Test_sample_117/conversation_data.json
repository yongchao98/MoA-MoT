    "The reaction between an enol and a halogen, such as bromine, is a fundamental process in organic chemistry known as α-halogenation. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. In this molecule, the hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to a carbon atom (C1) that is part of a double bond.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic bromine (Br₂).\n2.  This step forms a new carbon-bromine bond at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the one bearing the hydroxyl group, C2) and creates a resonancestabilized oxonium ion intermediate.\n3.  A weak base, such as the bromide ion (Br⁻) formed in the previous step, removes the proton from the oxygen atom.\n\nThis process regenerates the carbonyl group (C=O) at the C1 position and leaves a bromine atom attached to the alpha-carbon (C2). Therefore, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. The alternative reaction, a simple addition of Br₂ across the double bond to form a dibromo-alcohol, is not the major pathway for enols. Instead, the α-substitution reaction is highly favored.\n\nBased on this established chemical principle, the correct option is C.\n\nA) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: This is an electrophilic addition product, which is not the major outcome for an enol.\nB) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: This would require bromination at a carbon that is not the alpha-carbon and lacks a hydrogen to substitute, which is incorrect.\nC) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: This is the product of α-halogenation, the expected major reaction pathway.\nD) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: This is another stereoisomer of the less-favored addition product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
