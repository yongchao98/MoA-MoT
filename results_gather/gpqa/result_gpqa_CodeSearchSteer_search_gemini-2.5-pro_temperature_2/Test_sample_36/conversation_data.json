    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction series:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A**: This is the protection of the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) to form a 1,3-dithiane. The Lewis acid BF₃ acts as a catalyst. The product A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi ---> B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in compound A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic. This reaction forms a lithiated carbanion, B.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane ---> C**: The carbanion B is a strong nucleophile and reacts with bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. An ethyl group is added to the C2 position, which already holds an ethyl group from the initial propionaldehyde. The product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ ---> D**: This step is the deprotection of the dithiane group, which hydrolyzes the protected carbonyl to reveal a ketone. The starting material for this step is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane. The resulting ketone, D, has two ethyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon and is therefore 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**: This is a Wittig reaction. First, the Wittig reagent (ylide) is prepared from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane. The PPh₃ attacks the 3-bromopentane, and subsequent deprotonation by BuLi yields the ylide, (pentan-3-ylidene)triphenylphosphine [PPh₃=C(CH₂CH₃)₂]. This ylide then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by the C=C bond of the ylide.\n\n    *   Ketone (D): (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O\n    *   Ylide: PPh₃=C(CH₂CH₃)₂\n    *   Final Product (E): The reaction produces a molecule where two (CH₃CH₂)₂C units are joined by a double bond: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The IUPAC name for this highly symmetrical alkene is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### **¹³C-NMR Analysis of E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene)**\n\nTo determine the number of signals, we must identify the number of chemically unique carbon environments in the final molecule. The structure of E is:\n\n```\n      CH₂CH₃\n     /\nCH₃CH₂-C=C-CH₂CH₃\n       \\\n        CH₂CH₃\n```\n\nThe molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. A C₂ axis of symmetry passes through the center of the C=C double bond.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n1.  The two carbons of the central double bond (C=C) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one** signal.\n2.  All four ethyl groups are attached to the double-bonded carbons and are chemically equivalent. Therefore, all four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons of the ethyl groups are in the same environment. This will produce **one** signal.\n3.  Similarly, all four terminal methyl (-CH₃) carbons of the ethyl groups are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one** signal.\n\nIn total, the molecule will show 3 distinct signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
