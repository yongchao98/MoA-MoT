    "Based on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified by analyzing the information from each technique and calculating the degree of unsaturation for the possible formulas.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum**:\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids and alcohols. The broad nature of this peak suggests hydrogen bonding, which is typical for carboxylic acids that often exist as dimers.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch (1760-1690 cm⁻¹), which is present in functional groups like ketones, aldehydes, esters, and carboxylic acids.\n    *   Another strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to the carbons of an alkene, and they typically appear in the 4.5 to 7 ppm region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry**: The fragment peak observed at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a significant clue. This value corresponds to the formula weight of a carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺ (12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45), which strongly suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Chemical Formulas:\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each potential formula helps determine which one is consistent with the evidence of a C=O bond and a C=C bond (requiring a DoU of at least 2). The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is insufficient to account for both a double bond and a carbonyl group.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This degree of unsaturation perfectly accommodates one C=C bond and one C=O bond, which aligns with all the spectral evidence pointing to an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This would fit a saturated carboxylic acid but not the required C=C double bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While this has the correct DoU, it only has one oxygen atom, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid (which has two oxygens and is supported by the m/z = 45 fragment).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combined evidence from FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry points to a compound that contains a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. The formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option with the correct number of atoms and the necessary degree of unsaturation (2) to account for these functional groups.\n\n<<<B>>>"
