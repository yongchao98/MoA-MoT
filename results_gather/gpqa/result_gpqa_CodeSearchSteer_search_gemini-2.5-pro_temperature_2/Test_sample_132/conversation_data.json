    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), a multi-step calculation based on the principles of acid-base equilibria is required.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial molar concentrations of the two phosphate species present in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   In the solution, KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻).\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates into 2Na⁺ and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻).\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\nThe solution contains a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻), forming a buffer system. The equilibrium that governs the pH of this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, characterized by Ka₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration ([H⁺]):**\n    The relevant equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    The acid dissociation constant expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ × ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2 × 10⁻⁸) × (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 × 10⁻⁸ M\n\nFinally, we use the hydrogen ion concentration to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) from the third dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, characterized by Ka₃.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration ([PO₄³⁻]):**\n    The relevant equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    The acid dissociation constant expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    Rearranging to solve for the orthophosphate concentration:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ × ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    Because Ka₃ (1.8×10⁻¹²) is very small, the concentration of HPO₄²⁻ remains essentially unchanged.\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 × 10⁻¹²) × (0.02809 M / (8.11 × 10⁻⁸ M))\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.23 × 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculated value is closest to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
