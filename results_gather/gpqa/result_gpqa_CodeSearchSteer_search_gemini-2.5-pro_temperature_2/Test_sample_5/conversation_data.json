    "To find the energy spectrum for a particle of mass *m* in the given two-dimensional potential, we first need to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr²cos²(θ)\n\nWe can convert to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the relations:\nr² = x² + y²\nx = r cos(θ)\n\nSubstituting these into the potential equation:\nV(x, y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k(r cos(θ))²\nV(x, y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)kx²\n\nNow, we group the terms with x² and y²:\nV(x, y) = ((1/2)k + (3/2)k)x² + (1/2)ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2)kx² + (1/2)ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)ky²\n\nThis potential represents two independent (uncoupled) quantum harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The potential can be separated as:\nV(x, y) = V(x) + V(y)\nwhere V(x) = (1/2)(4k)x² and V(y) = (1/2)ky²\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential V(q) = (1/2)k_q q² are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency is ω = √(k_q / m).\n\nFor the oscillator in the x-direction, we have k_x = 4k. The angular frequency is:\nω_x = √(4k / m) = 2√(k / m)\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-direction are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ(2√(k/m))\n\nFor the oscillator in the y-direction, we have k_y = k. The angular frequency is:\nω_y = √(k / m)\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ(2√(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
