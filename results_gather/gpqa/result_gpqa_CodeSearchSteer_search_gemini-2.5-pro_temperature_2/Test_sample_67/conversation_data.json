    "This problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment, and thus its spin, aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, `S_z`. We can denote this initial state as `|+Z⟩`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. For any time `t > 0`, the system's evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian, `H = -μ · B = -γB * S_y`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment operator, `B` is the magnetic field, `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio, and `S_y` is the spin operator for the Y-direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). The expectation value of the Z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`, will oscillate as the spin precesses.\n\n4.  **Frequency of Oscillation**: The precession occurs at the Larmor frequency, `ω`. The angular frequency of oscillation of the expectation value of the spin components perpendicular to the field (in this case, `<S_z>` and `<S_x>`) is given by the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nThe expectation value of the Z-component of the spin, `<S_z(t)>`, can be calculated and is found to be `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`. Consequently, the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)> = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\nThis expression shows an oscillation described by `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
