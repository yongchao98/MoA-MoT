    "All operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry, however, can be violated by operators in the SMEFT.\n\nThe SMEFT is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators that are invariant under the same symmetries as the Standard Model itself, including the fundamental spacetime symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental assumption in the construction of the SMEFT. The operators are built to be Lorentz scalars, ensuring that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare invariance encompasses both Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations. It is a foundational symmetry of quantum field theory upon which the Standard Model and, by extension, the SMEFT are built.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** The combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) is not a required symmetry in the SMEFT. In fact, the SMEFT provides a framework for parametrizing new sources of CP violation beyond what is present in the Standard Model. There is extensive research on classifying and constraining these CP-violating operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem, a fundamental result in quantum field theory, states that any local, unitary, and Lorentz-invariant theory must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it is expected to respect CPT symmetry. It is often noted that CPT violation implies Lorentz violation, so by requiring Lorentz invariance, CPT invariance is also implied.\n\nTherefore, Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n<<<C>>>"
