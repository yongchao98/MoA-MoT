    "Here's an analysis of the situation to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Analysis of the Mean Free Paths\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1):** The term λ1 refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This is described by the standard formula from the kinetic theory of gases:\n    *   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n    *   σ_gg is the collision cross-section for a gas-gas collision. In a simple hard-sphere model, this is πd², where 'd' is the molecular diameter (or π(2r)², where 'r' is the molecular radius).\n    *   The factor √2 accounts for the relative motion of the colliding molecules, as all molecules in the gas are moving.\n\n2.  **Mean Free Path of Beam Electrons (λ2):** The term λ2 refers to the average distance an electron from the high-energy beam travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule. The formula for this is slightly different:\n    *   λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n    *   σ_eg is the scattering cross-section for an electron-gas molecule collision.\n    *   The √2 factor is absent because the projectile (a 1000 kV electron) is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, while the target gas molecules have much lower thermal velocities and can be considered essentially stationary.\n\n3.  **Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    The key to comparing λ1 and λ2 lies in comparing their respective collision cross-sections, σ_gg and σ_eg.\n    *   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gg):** In a simplified model, when two molecules of diameter 'd' collide, a collision occurs if their centers come within a distance 'd' of each other. The effective area for a collision is thus πd².\n    *   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_eg):** An electron is, for practical purposes, a point particle with a negligible radius compared to a gas molecule. The \"collision\" is an electromagnetic scattering event.\n        *   **Geometric Argument:** From a purely geometric viewpoint, the cross-section would be determined only by the size of the target molecule (πr², where r = d/2). This would make σ_gg (which is π(2r)²) about four times larger than σ_eg (πr²). This alone suggests λ2 would be larger than λ1.\n        *   **Physical Interaction:** While electrons are point-like, they interact with gas molecules via the long-range Coulomb force. This can lead to a larger effective cross-section than the molecule's physical size would suggest, especially for low-energy electrons. However, the electrons in this scenario are highly energetic (1000 kV). The scattering cross-section for high-energy charged particles generally decreases as their energy increases. The electron's high velocity means it spends very little time near any single gas molecule, reducing the probability of a significant scattering event.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nConsidering these points, the effective collision cross-section for a high-energy electron scattering off a gas molecule (σ_eg) is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules colliding with each other (σ_gg).\n\nSince λ is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), a smaller cross-section results in a longer mean free path. The combined effect of the smaller effective cross-section for the electron and the absence of the √2 factor in its mean free path formula leads to a definitive conclusion:\n\n**λ₂ > λ₁**\n\nThe hard-sphere model suggests that λ₂ could be more than five times larger than λ₁. While this is a simplification, it indicates that λ₂ is not just slightly larger than λ₁, but significantly so. Reviewing the given options, option A is the only one that reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<A>>>"
