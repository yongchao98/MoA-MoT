    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Normalize the state |α⟩**\n\nThe given state is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. Let's call the unnormalized state |ψ⟩:\n|ψ⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to calculate its norm ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ and then divide the state by the square root of the norm.\nThe bra ⟨ψ| is:\n⟨ψ| = (1-i)⟨up| + (2+i)⟨down|\n\nThe inner product is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [(1-i)⟨up| + (2+i)⟨down|] ⋅ [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) = (1+1) + (4+1) = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nThe normalization constant is 1/√7. The normalized state |α⟩ is:\n|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]\n\nIn matrix notation, where |up⟩ =ᵀ and |down⟩ =ᵀ, the state |α⟩ is:\n|α⟩ = 1/√7 * [ 1+i, 2-i ]ᵀ\n\n2.  **Determine the operator A and its eigenstates/eigenvalues**\n\nThe matrix elements are Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. This gives the matrix:\nA = [ 0  ħ/2 ]\n    [ ħ/2  0 ]\nA = (ħ/2) * [ 0 1 ]\n            [ 1 0 ]\nThis operator is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σₓ.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet( [-λ  ħ/2] ) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0\n( [ħ/2  -λ] )\nThis gives two eigenvalues: **λ₁ = +ħ/2** and **λ₂ = -ħ/2**.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\nFor λ₁ = +ħ/2, the eigenstate |v₁⟩ is found by solving (A - λ₁I)|v₁⟩ = 0:\n[ -ħ/2  ħ/2 ] [a] =  => -a + b = 0 => a = b\n[  ħ/2 -ħ/2 ] [b]  \nThe eigenstate is proportional toᵀ. Normalizing it gives:\n|v₁⟩ = 1/√2 *ᵀ = 1/√2 * (|up⟩ + |down⟩)\n\nFor λ₂ = -ħ/2, the eigenstate |v₂⟩ is found by solving (A - λ₂I)|v₂⟩ = 0:\n[ ħ/2  ħ/2 ] [a] = => a + b = 0 => a = -b\n[ ħ/2  ħ/2 ] [b]  \nThe eigenstate is proportional to [1, -1]ᵀ. Normalizing it gives:\n|v₂⟩ = 1/√2 * [1, -1]ᵀ = 1/√2 * (|up⟩ - |down⟩)\n\n3.  **Calculate the probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue λi is given by P(λi) = |⟨vᵢ|α⟩|².\n\nProbability for λ₁ = +ħ/2:\nP(λ₁) = |⟨v₁|α⟩|² = | (1/√2 *) ⋅ (1/√7 * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ) |²\nP(λ₁) = | 1/√14 * (1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)) |²\nP(λ₁) = | 1/√14 * (3) |² = 9/14 ≈ **0.643**\n\nProbability for λ₂ = -ħ/2:\nP(λ₂) = |⟨v₂|α⟩|² = | (1/√2 * [1, -1]) ⋅ (1/√7 * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ) |²\nP(λ₂) = | 1/√14 * (1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)) |²\nP(λ₂) = | 1/√14 * (1+i-2+i) |²\nP(λ₂) = | 1/√14 * (-1+2i) |² = ((-1)²+2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ **0.357**\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n4.  **Calculate the average value**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by ⟨A⟩ = Σ P(λᵢ)λᵢ:\n⟨A⟩ = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂\n⟨A⟩ = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)\n⟨A⟩ = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5)\n⟨A⟩ = 4ħ/28 = **ħ/7**\n\nComparing the results with the given options:\n*   Probabilities: ~0.64 and ~0.36\n*   Average value: ħ/7\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
