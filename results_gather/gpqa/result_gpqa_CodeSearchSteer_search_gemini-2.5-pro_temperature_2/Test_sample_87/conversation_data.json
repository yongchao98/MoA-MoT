    "The scenario described points to an active immune response occurring in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), specifically in the Peyer's patches. When the GFP-tagged viral proteins (antigens) reach the Peyer's patches, they trigger the activation and proliferation of B cells within specialized structures called germinal centers. The crucial observation is the \"high variability\" found in the variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating cells.\n\nThis high variability is the hallmark of **somatic hypermutation (SHM)**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why somatic hypermutation is the correct process and the others are not:\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a biological mechanism that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. It introduces numerous point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genesâ€”both heavy and light chains. This process, followed by selection of B cells that bind the antigen with higher affinity, is known as affinity maturation. The explicit purpose of SHM is to diversify the B cell receptors to generate antibodies that bind more strongly to the invading pathogen. The \"high variability\" observed in the experiment is the direct outcome of this process.\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system that helps to clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic mutation and is not responsible for generating antibody diversity.\n*   **B) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in B cells within germinal centers, often concurrently with SHM. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which switches the antibody's isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA) and thus its effector function. It does *not* alter the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen specificity.\n*   **C) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors by combining different Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) gene segments. Crucially, this happens in developing B cells in the bone marrow, *before* they ever encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in mature B cells *after* encountering an antigen in a peripheral lymphoid organ.\n\nTherefore, the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating B cells in the Peyer's patches following antigen exposure is characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
