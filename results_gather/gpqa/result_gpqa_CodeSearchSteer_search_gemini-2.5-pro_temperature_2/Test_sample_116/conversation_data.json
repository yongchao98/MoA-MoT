    "Here's a detailed analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a type of substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism in biphenyls can occur due to a phenomenon called atropisomerism. This happens when there is hindered rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. The bulky substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar due to steric strain. This restricted rotation leads to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations, known as enantiomers. Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. The first experimental evidence of atropisomerism was in a similarly substituted biphenyl compound, 6,6'-dinitrodiphenic acid.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule's central carbon atom (the second carbon) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center, a condition that typically leads to optical isomerism. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. As a result, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers and is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: In benzophenone, the central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), meaning it is sp² hybridized and double-bonded to an oxygen atom. It is also bonded to two phenyl groups. Since this carbon is not bonded to four different groups and the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral. Unsubstituted benzophenone does not show optical isomerism. While very specific, highly substituted benzophenones can be forced into chiral conformations, the parent benzophenone molecule is not optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, and each of these carbons is bonded to a hydrogen and a methoxycarbonyl group. Due to the double bond, rotation is restricted, leading to geometric isomerism (*cis* vs. *trans*), but not optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is a planar molecule with a center of symmetry, making it achiral and, therefore, not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
