    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the relative speed and total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, since they are moving in the same direction.\n\nThe formula is:\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut (v₁) = 0.6c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut (v₂) = 0.5c\n\nPlugging in the values:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n**v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a system of particles is the sum of the total energies of each particle. The total energy of a single particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E₁):**\n*   Mass (m₁) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁) for the first astronaut:\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ₁ = 1 / √(0.64)\nγ₁ = 1 / 0.8\nγ₁ = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate the energy E₁:\nE₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c²\nE₁ = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\nE₁ = 2.5mc²\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E₂):**\n*   Mass (m₂) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n\nNext, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂) for the second astronaut:\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\nγ₂ = 1 / √(0.75)\nγ₂ = 1 / (√3 / 2)\nγ₂ = 2 / √3\nγ₂ ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate the energy E₂:\nE₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c²\nE₂ = (2 / √3) * (3m) * c²\nE₂ ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc²\nE₂ ≈ 3.4641mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\nE_total = E₁ + E₂\nE_total = 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc²\n**E_total ≈ 5.96mc²**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed (v_rel) ≈ 0.14c\n*   Total energy (E) ≈ 5.96mc²\n\nComparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
