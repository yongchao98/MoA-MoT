    "The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n**Detailed step-by-step derivation:**\n\n**1. Define the Initial State and Operators:**\n*   The initial (unnormalized) state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   The operator for the observable P is:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The operator for the observable Q is:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. First Measurement: Probability of obtaining P = 0**\nTo find the probability of measuring an eigenvalue, we first need to find the corresponding eigenvector for that eigenvalue.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector of P for eigenvalue 0:**\n    We need to solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`, which simplifies to `P|v⟩ = 0`. Let `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n    This matrix multiplication results in the following system of equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0 => x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. To get a normalized eigenvector, we set its length to 1. The unnormalized vector can be represented as `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n    The squared length is `1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2`. The normalization factor is `1/√2`.\n    So, the normalized eigenvector `|p_0⟩` for the eigenvalue P=0 is `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:**\n    The probability is given by the formula: `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ⟩|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`.\n    First, we calculate the inner product `⟨p_0|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨p_0|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T = (1/√2) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√2) * (-2) = -√2`\n    Next, we calculate the squared norm of the initial state `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n    Now, we find the probability:\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-√2|^2 / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3`\n\n**3. State Collapse After Measurement**\nAfter measuring P=0, the state of the system collapses to the eigenvector corresponding to that measurement, `|p_0⟩`. The new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**4. Second Measurement: Probability of obtaining Q = -1**\nNow, we perform a measurement of Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector of Q for eigenvalue -1:**\n    The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. The eigenvalues are its diagonal entries (1, 0, -1), and the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector `|q_-1⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue Q=-1 is:\n    `|q_-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the new state `|ψ'⟩`:**\n    The probability is given by `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩|^2`. Since `|ψ'⟩` is already normalized, we don't need a denominator.\n    `⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] * ((1/√2)[1, 0, -1]^T) = (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n    The probability is the squared magnitude:\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|^2 = 1/2`\n\n**5. Total Probability**\nThe probability of a sequence of measurements is the product of the individual probabilities.\nTotal Probability = `Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\nTotal Probability = `(1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\n<<<B>>>"
