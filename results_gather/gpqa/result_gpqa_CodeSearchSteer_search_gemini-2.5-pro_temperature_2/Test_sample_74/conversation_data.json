  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "An analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the direct cause of the failed protein expression.\n\nThe sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the correct start codon for translation. This is followed by the sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`, which correctly encodes the amino acid sequence of the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA).\n\nHowever, the analysis of the codons immediately following the HA tag sequence shows the problem. The sequence, read in triplets from the start codon, is:\n5' `ATG` `TAC` `CCA` `TAC` `GAT` `GTT` `CCA` `GAT` `TAC` `GCC` `AAA` `TGA`... 3'\n\nThe triplet `TGA` is a nonsense or stop codon in the standard genetic code. When the ribosome encounters this in-frame `TGA` codon, it terminates translation. This is known as a premature termination codon (PTC). This premature termination results in the synthesis of a very short, non-functional peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K), not the full-length GADD45G protein. The presence of a PTC is a common cause of failed protein expression in genetic engineering, leading to truncated and non-functional proteins that are often rapidly degraded.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** The DNA sequence for the HA tag is correct and does not contain mutations that would result in a different amino acid sequence.\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While protein stability can be an issue, the primary problem here is that the full protein is never synthesized in the first place due to the premature stop codon.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is incorrect for multiple reasons. The codon in question is TGA (UGA in mRNA), not TAA (UAA in mRNA). Furthermore, translation termination is mediated by release factors that recognize stop codons, not by a tRNA. Lastly, the experiment was performed in hamster cells, not mouse cells.\n\n<<<A>>>"
