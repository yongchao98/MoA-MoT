    "In a universe with magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south magnetic poles—two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for their existence.\n\nThe standard form of Maxwell's equations in our universe does not include magnetic monopoles. The two equations that would change are:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field):** In our universe, this law is expressed as ∇⋅B = 0. This states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, which mathematically means there are no magnetic \"charges\" or monopoles. Field lines are always closed loops. If magnetic monopoles existed, this law would change to ∇⋅B = ρm (where ρm represents the magnetic charge density), in a direct analogy to Gauss's law for electricity. This change reflects that magnetic field lines can begin or end on magnetic monopoles.\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** In our universe, this law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, which describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a moving monopole would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). This magnetic current would induce a circulating electric field, requiring the addition of a new term to Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - Jm.\n\nTherefore, the equations related to both the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field would be different.\n\n<<<B>>>"
