    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its chemical formula can be written as CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. This is equivalent to a mass ratio of approximately 1/7 (100 / 14.28 ≈ 7).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`. Using approximate atomic masses (H≈1, C≈12), we get `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, which leads to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂. The general formula for a hydrocarbon where the number of hydrogen atoms is twice the number of carbon atoms (CₙH₂ₙ) corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   The problem also mentions that Z is a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents that fit the CₙH₂ₙ formula include cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄). Both are widely used as solvents.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactions and Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X and does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z. Let's call the other component W. So, Y = {Z, W}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (Z + W) under severe conditions yields only Z. Since Z is a cycloalkane and already saturated, it doesn't react. This means that W must hydrogenate to form Z.\n    *   Since W doesn't decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated, it is most likely an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. Severe conditions are typically required to hydrogenate an aromatic ring.\n    *   This leads to two primary possibilities:\n        *   **Scenario 1:** If Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), then W must be benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene hydrogenates to form cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂).\n        *   **Scenario 2:** If Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), then W must be toluene (C₇H₈). Toluene hydrogenates to form methylcyclohexane (C₇H₈ + 3H₂ → C₇H₁₄).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Components of Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B. So, X = {A, B}.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The problem states that molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X (A + B) gives *only* Z. This implies that both A and B have the same carbon skeleton as Z, and both are hydrogenated to Z.\n    *   Mixture X reacts to form mixture Y in what is described as a disproportionation reaction. This type of reaction, in this context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated. Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1.\n    *   `A + B → Z + W`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   Based on the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on both sides of the reaction `A + B → Z + W` must be equal. Since A, B, Z, and W all share the same carbon skeleton, we only need to balance the hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total hydrogens in reactants = Total hydrogens in products.\n    *   H(A) + H(B) = H(Z) + H(W)\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1 (C₆ compounds):**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), W = Benzene (C₆H₆).\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is 12 + 6 = 18.\n        *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n        *   We need to find plausible structures for A and B. They must be C₆ unsaturated rings (to hydrogenate to cyclohexane) without conjugated bonds.\n            *   A can be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀).\n            *   B can be cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈), which is not conjugated.\n        *   Let's check the hydrogen count: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches. The reaction C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ is balanced and represents a plausible hydrogen transfer.\n        *   This scenario points to a total of **18** hydrogen atoms.\n\n    *   **Scenario 2 (C₇ compounds):**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), W = Toluene (C₇H₈).\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is 14 + 8 = 22.\n        *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X is 22.\n        *   Plausible structures for A and B would be a methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀).\n        *   Checking the hydrogen count: 12 + 10 = 22. This also works.\n        *   This scenario points to a total of **22** hydrogen atoms.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both scenarios are chemically plausible and fit the description. However, the reactions involving cyclohexane and benzene are fundamental examples in organic chemistry. The disproportionation of cyclohexene and related compounds to form cyclohexane and benzene is a well-known process called the Zelinsky disproportionation. In the context of a typical chemistry problem, the most fundamental example is usually the intended answer. Thus, the C₆ scenario is the most likely intended solution.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component (C₆H₁₀ and C₆H₈), which is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
