    "Here is a breakdown of the chemical reactions and the subsequent analysis:\n\n**Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\nThe starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, is a chiral ketone. The chiral center is at the C5 position. It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. Because the starting molecule is chiral, the reduction results in the formation of two diastereomers:\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\nThese two products are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one chiral center (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n**Reaction II: Reduction of pentane-2,4-dione**\nThe starting material, pentane-2,4-dione, is an achiral molecule. It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), which reduces both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to hydroxyl groups. This reaction creates two new chiral centers. The possible stereoisomeric products are:\n*   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since the reactants are achiral, these are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n*   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nThe meso compound and the enantiomeric pair are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Analysis of the Combined Products by HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined into a single mixture. This mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II.\n\n1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (from Reaction I)\n2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (from Reaction I)\n3.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** (from Reaction II)\n4.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (from Reaction II)\n5.  **meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (from Reaction II)\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by a normal-phase column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different retention time, resulting in a separate peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The products of Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II and will elute separately.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram is 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, just as they were on the normal-phase column, resulting in **2 peaks**.\n*   The racemic mixture from Reaction II will be resolved into its two separate enantiomers, ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol), giving **2 peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral. However, it is a diastereomer of the other two compounds from this reaction and will be separated from them, giving **1 peak**.\n*   Since all five compounds in the mixture are stereoisomers and will be distinguished by the chiral column, a total of 2 + 2 + 1 = **5 peaks** will be observed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chromatogram from the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the chromatogram from the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>"
