    "The net potential energy of a point charge `q` placed a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` can be calculated using the method of images.\n\n1.  **Method of Images:** The electric field and potential outside the sphere can be accurately described by replacing the sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\". This image charge, when combined with the real charge `q`, creates a potential of zero on the surface that would correspond to the sphere's actual surface.\n\n2.  **Image Charge Characteristics:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R` (`d > R`), the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   **Location:** It is placed at a distance `b = R²/d` from the center, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere's surface. This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of a charge `q` in the presence of the potential `V_image` created by the image charge is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the energy stored in the field is being calculated, and simply using the interaction energy between the final real and image charges (`k*q*q'/r`) would lead to double-counting.\n\n4.  **Derivation:**\n    *   First, find the potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) that is created by the image charge `q'`. The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   Distance between charges = `d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   The potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b) = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n    *   Simplifying this expression:\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d² - R²) `\n    *   Now, calculate the potential energy of the system:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Comparing this result with the given options, it exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
