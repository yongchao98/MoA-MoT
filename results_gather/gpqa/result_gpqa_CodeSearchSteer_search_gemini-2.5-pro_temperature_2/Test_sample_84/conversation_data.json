    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2):\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\n    Since `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both planets, and it's given that the albedo `A` is the same for both (`A1 = A2`), these terms cancel out. The formula simplifies to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a1)^(1/2) / (1 / a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)`\n\n2.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observables**\n    The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures the Doppler shift of the star's light caused by the orbiting planet. The maximum observed radial velocity, or semi-amplitude (K), for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)`\n    where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `a` is the semi-major axis, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n    Since both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbital planes must be viewed nearly edge-on, which means their inclinations `i` are close to 90°, and therefore `sin(i) ≈ 1`. We assume `sin(i)` is the same for both planets.\n\n3.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**\n    Let's rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    `K^2 = (M_p^2 * sin^2(i) / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n    `a = (M_p^2 * sin^2(i) * G) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n    Now, let's find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * sin^2(i) * G) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * sin^2(i) * G) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n\n    The terms `G`, `M_star`, and `sin^2(i)` cancel out, leaving:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratios of Mass and Velocity**\n    The ratio of the planet masses is given:\n    `M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5 / 7`\n\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K = c * Δλ / λ`). Therefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ1 / Δλ2`:\n    `K1 / K2 = (0.03 Å) / (0.04 Å) = 3 / 4`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    Now substitute these ratios back into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n    Finally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
