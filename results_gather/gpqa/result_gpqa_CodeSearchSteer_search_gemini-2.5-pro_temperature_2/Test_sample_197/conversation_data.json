    "Here is a step-by-p-step calculation to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Equilibrium\n\nIn the solution, the cobalt(II) ions, Co²⁺, react with thiocyanate ions, SCN⁻, to form a series of complexes: [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is given as c(Co) = 10⁻² M.\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺,       β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂],      β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻,    β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻,    β₄ = 16\n\n### 2. The Mole Fraction (α)\n\nThe mole fraction (α) of a specific complex represents its concentration relative to the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], so we need to calculate its mole fraction, α₂.\n\nThe formula for the mole fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the stability constants and the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻]:\n**α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)**\n\n### 3. Approximating the Free Ligand Concentration\n\nThe initial concentration of thiocyanate is 0.1 M, which is ten times the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). Because the ligand is in significant excess, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻], as being equal to its total initial concentration. This is a common and reasonable simplification for such problems.\n[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the formula for α₂.\n\n**First, calculate the terms for the denominator:**\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n**Next, sum these terms to find the value of the denominator (Σ):**\nΣ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n**The numerator is the term for the desired complex, [Co(SCN)₂]:**\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\n**Finally, calculate the mole fraction α₂:**\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:**\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
