    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through benzyne intermediates. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nSodium amide (NaNH2) is a very strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron in this case) from a position adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n\n1.  **Abstraction of a hydrogen (H) from carbon-6:** The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes a proton from the carbon at position 6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from carbon-1 to form a benzyne intermediate. The deuterium at position 2 remains untouched. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Abstraction of a deuterium (D) from carbon-2:** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from carbon-2. This is slower than removing a proton due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway. This abstraction, followed by bromide elimination from carbon-1, forms a benzyne intermediate between carbons 1 and 2. Since the deuterium was removed, the resulting intermediate is a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nThus, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n\n1.  **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne:**\n    *   The triple bond is between carbons 1 and 6, and the deuterium is on carbon 2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group adds to C1, and subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group adds to C6, and subsequent protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n2.  **Attack on benzyne:**\n    *   The intermediate is the symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne.\n    *   Attack by the amino group at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the products from both pathways, there are three possible, structurally distinct organic products formed in this reaction:\n*   Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)\n*   2-Deuterioaniline (o-deuterioaniline)\n*   3-Deuterioaniline (m-deuterioaniline)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
