    "The calculations performed in the thought process are confirmed by the search results. Specifically, multiple sources confirm the underlying physics principles of conservation of energy and momentum for a two-body decay at rest.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy (rest mass of the pion) equals the sum of the total energies of the products (muon and neutrino).\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the products must be emitted with equal and opposite momenta.\n*   **Particle Masses:** The rest mass of the charged pion (π+) is 139.6 MeV/c², and the rest mass of the muon (μ+) is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino is considered massless for this calculation.\n*   **Kinetic Energy Calculation:** A worked-out example for the negative pion decay (which is kinetically identical) confirms the results. It calculates the kinetic energy of the muon to be 4.1 MeV and the energy of the neutrino to be 29.8 MeV. Another source also states the kinetic energy of the muon is measured at 4.13 MeV.\n\nThe calculation steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Find the momentum of the decay products.**\n    From conservation of energy and momentum, the momentum (p) of each product particle can be calculated using the formula:\n    `p*c = [(m_pi² - m_mu²) * c⁴] / (2 * m_pi * c²)`, where `m_pi` is the pion mass and `m_mu` is the muon mass.\n    *   `m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   `m_mu * c² = 105.7 MeV`\n    *   `p*c = [139.6² - 105.7²] / (2 * 139.6)`\n    *   `p*c = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2`\n    *   `p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n2.  **Calculate the kinetic energy (KE) of the neutrino (nu).**\n    Since the neutrino is considered massless, its total energy is equal to its momentum times `c`, and its kinetic energy is its total energy.\n    *   `KE_nu = E_nu = p * c ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n3.  **Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (mu+).**\n    The total energy of the muon `(E_mu)` is the initial energy of the pion minus the energy carried away by the neutrino.\n    *   `E_mu = (m_pi * c²) - E_nu`\n    *   `E_mu = 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 MeV`\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.\n    *   `KE_mu = E_mu - (m_mu * c²)`\n    *   `KE_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV`\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino, which aligns with the values in the provided solution A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
