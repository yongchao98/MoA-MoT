    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus at rest with a total rest-mass energy of `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Mass Relationships:**\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2` (The first fragment is twice as massive as the second).\n    *   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M` (The sum of the fragment masses is 99% of the initial mass).\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n\nFirst, we determine the rest masses of the two fragments, `m1` and `m2`, in relation to the initial mass `M`.\n\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Now, find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we calculate their corresponding rest-mass energies:\n\n*   **Massive fragment (m1):**\n    `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   **Lighter fragment (m2):**\n    `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe missing mass has been converted into the kinetic energy (T) of the fragments. This total kinetic energy is known as the Q-value of the reaction.\n\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = (Mc^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is `3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, kinetic energy is `T_cl = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   The kinetic energies are `T1_cl = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_cl = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`\n*   This gives us `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)\n\nFor the correct calculation, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n\n*   Rearranging for momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `mc^2`: `E = T + mc^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the momentum equation: `(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Substitute the known values: `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Solving for `T1`:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for `T1`.\n\n*   `ΔT1 = T1 (relativistic) - T1 (classical)`\n*   `ΔT1 = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the two values is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
