    "Here is the step-by-step synthesis:\n\n*   **Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n    Benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction called nitration. The electrophile, a nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), replaces a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Product 1 is nitrobenzene.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\n    Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron powder, which acts as a catalyst. This is another electrophilic aromatic substitution. The nitro group (–NO₂) is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director. Therefore, the bromine atom is added to the position *meta* (position 3) to the nitro group.\n    *   **Product 2 is *m*-bromonitrobenzene (or 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene).**\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\n    Product 2 (*m*-bromonitrobenzene) is stirred with a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenation, reduces the nitro group (–NO₂) to an amino group (–NH₂).\n    *   **Product 3 is *m*-bromoaniline (or 3-bromoaniline).**\n\n*   **Step 4: Diazotization**\n    Product 3 (*m*-bromoaniline) is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF₄). This reaction converts the primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The resulting product is stable at low temperatures.\n    *   **Product 4 is 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.**\n\n*   **Step 5: Aryl-Aryl Coupling**\n    Product 4 is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). This is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, which is an aryl-aryl coupling that proceeds through a radical mechanism. The 3-bromobenzenediazonium salt decomposes to form a 3-bromophenyl radical. This radical then attacks the anisole molecule. The methoxy group (–OCH₃) on anisole is an *ortho, para*-director. The coupling occurs primarily at the *para* position due to less steric hindrance, leading to the formation of a biphenyl derivative. The 3-bromophenyl group attaches to the position para to the methoxy group of anisole.\n    *   **Product 5 is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.**\n\nComparing the final product with the given choices:\n*   A) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl\n*   B) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl\n*   C) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl\n*   D) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl\n\nThe determined structure, 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
