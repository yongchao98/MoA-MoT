    "The decay of the hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions involves an intermediate state. The path and the probability of a specific route can be determined by applying the principles of quantum mechanics, particularly the selection rules for these transitions.\n\n### Analysis of the Decay Process\n\n1.  **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    The initial state is $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$, also known as the 3s state. For an electric dipole transition, the selection rules are $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is the most probable transition. Therefore, the intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state). According to the selection rules, $m'$ can be -1, 0, or 1.\n\n2.  **Branching Ratio for the First Transition**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, the atom has no preferred direction of emission. Consequently, it decays into the three possible magnetic sub-levels ($m' = -1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state with equal probability. The total probability of decaying from 3s to 2p is the sum of the probabilities for each final sub-level. The probability for any single channel, for instance to $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is therefore 1/3.\n\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n3.  **Second Transition: $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    The intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (a 2p state) decays to a lower energy state. Applying the dipole selection rules again ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$), the p-state ($l=1$) can decay to an s-state ($l=0$) or a d-state ($l=2$). Since the only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which only has an s-orbital ($l=0$), the only possible decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Thus, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n    $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$\n\n4.  **Total Probability of the Cascade**\n    The probability of the specific decay route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct transition route and corresponding probability among the given options is the one that follows the path through the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ with a total probability of 1/3.\n\nThe correct choice is:\n**A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n\n<<<A>>>"
