    "An analysis of two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2, reveals key differences in their total mass. Based on observational data, system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2.\n\nThe determination of the mass of a binary star system hinges on Kepler's third law, which can be adapted for spectroscopic binaries—star systems where the individual stars cannot be seen separately but their orbital motions can be detected through shifts in their spectral lines. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where spectral lines from both stars are visible, the total mass of the system (M) is directly proportional to its orbital period (P) and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K_a + K_b).\n\nThe relationship can be expressed as:\nM_total ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)³\n\nFor the given systems:\n\n**System_1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K_a1, K_b1) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes = 15 km/s\n\n**System_2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K_a2, K_b2) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes = 25 km/s\n\nThe presence of eclipses in both systems indicates that their orbital planes are viewed nearly edge-on, allowing for this direct calculation.\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can set up a ratio of their proportional masses:\n\nRatio (M1 / M2) = [P1 * (K_a1 + K_b1)³] / [P2 * (K_a2 + K_b2)³]\nRatio = [2 * (10 + 5)³] / [1 * (15 + 10)³]\nRatio = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nRatio = (2 * 3375) / (15625)\nRatio = 6750 / 15625\nRatio ≈ 0.432\n\nThis calculation shows that system_1 has about 43.2% of the mass of system_2. Therefore, the factor is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
