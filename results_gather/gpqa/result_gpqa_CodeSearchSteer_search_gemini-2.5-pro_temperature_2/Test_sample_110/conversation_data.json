    "Here are the completed reactions with the major products selected based on steric hindrance and product stability.\n\n### **Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK (potassium tert-butoxide) as a base.\n*   **Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate, which acts as the nucleophile. Ethyl acrylate is the Michael acceptor (the electrophile).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) at positions C2 and C6. The C2 carbon is a quaternary carbon with no protons to be removed. The C6 carbon has one proton. Therefore, the bulky base, t-BuOK, abstracts the only available alpha-proton from the C6 position to form the enolate.\n    2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The resulting enolate nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester). This is a conjugate addition.\n    3.  **Protonation:** The intermediate is then protonated to yield the final product.\n*   **Product A:** The addition results in a new carbon-carbon bond between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The product formed is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. The naming convention treats the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain, with the complex cyclohexyl group as a substituent.\n\n### **Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile) in the presence of KOH and H₂O.\n*   **Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The protons on the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane are acidic.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Carbanion Formation:** The base, KOH, removes a proton from the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, creating a resonance-stabilized carbanion.\n    2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n*   **Product B:** The new C-C bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. When naming this product according to IUPAC rules, the nitrile group has the highest priority. The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has six carbons (hexanenitrile). Numbering from the nitrile, there is a methyl group on C3 and a nitro group on C4. Therefore, the major product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
