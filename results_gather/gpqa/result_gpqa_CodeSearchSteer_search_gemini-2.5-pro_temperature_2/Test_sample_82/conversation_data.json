    "### **Problem Analysis**\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid:** First, the initial 0.05 M acetic acid solution is diluted.\n    *   Initial Volume (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Initial Molarity (M1) = 0.05 M\n    *   Final Volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, the new molarity (M2) of the acetic acid is calculated:\n        *   (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm³) = M2 * (40.00 cm³)\n        *   M2 = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n    *   The initial moles of acetic acid to be titrated are: 0.025 mol/L * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** This point is in the buffer region, where both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) are present. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH.\n    *   pH = pKa + log (\\[conjugate base]/\\[weak acid])\n    *   The pKa is calculated from the given Ka:\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate, and 75% remains. The ratio of \\[conjugate base]/\\[weak acid] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places gives a pH of **4.25**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, which hydrolyzes water.\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. This makes the solution basic.\n    *   **Volume to reach equivalence:**\n        *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of Acetic Acid = 0.001 mol\n        *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n    *   **Total volume at equivalence:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   **Concentration of acetate (CH₃COO⁻):**\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n    *   **Calculate Kb for the acetate ion:**\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   **Calculate [OH⁻] from hydrolysis:**\n        *   Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ x² / 0.02\n        *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n        *   x² = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n        *   pOH = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26 (rounding the calculated 4.253 up), and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
