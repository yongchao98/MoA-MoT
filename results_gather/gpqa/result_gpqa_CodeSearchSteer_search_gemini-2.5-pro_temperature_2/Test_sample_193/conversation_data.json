    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we need to sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states, calculate the energy for each, and then group them by energy level.\n\nThe 8 microstates for (S1, S2, S3) are:\n1.  (+1, +1, +1): In this state, S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = 1, and S2S3 = 1.\n    E = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J.\n2.  (-1, -1, -1): In this state, S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = 1, and S2S3 = 1.\n    E = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J.\n\n    These two states have the same energy E1 = -3J. The degeneracy of this energy level is g1 = 2.\n\n3.  (+1, +1, -1): In this state, S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, and S2S3 = -1.\n    E = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J.\n4.  (+1, -1, +1): In this state, S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = 1, and S2S3 = -1.\n    E = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J.\n5.  (-1, +1, +1): In this state, S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, and S2S3 = 1.\n    E = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = J.\n6.  (+1, -1, -1): In this state, S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, and S2S3 = 1.\n    E = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = J.\n7.  (-1, +1, -1): In this state, S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = 1, and S2S3 = -1.\n    E = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J.\n8.  (-1, -1, +1): In this state, S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, and S2S3 = -1.\n    E = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J.\n\n    These six states all have the same energy E2 = J. The degeneracy of this energy level is g2 = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states, which can be written as a sum over the energy levels multiplied by their degeneracies:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\n\nPlugging in the energy values and their degeneracies we found:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\nB) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\nD) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
