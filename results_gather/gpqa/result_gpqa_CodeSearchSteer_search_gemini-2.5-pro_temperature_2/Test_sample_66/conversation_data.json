    "In quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum are conserved during coupling. The state of the two-electron system is given as `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>`. This is a state in the coupled basis. The quantum numbers `l` and `m` represent the total orbital angular momentum and its z-component, respectively.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the quantum numbers:\n*   `l1 = 1`: Orbital angular momentum for electron 1 (since it's in a p orbital).\n*   `l2 = 1`: Orbital angular momentum for electron 2 (also in a p orbital).\n*   `l = 2`: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1`: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed as `m = m1 + m2`. In this problem, the system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number `m` is -1.\n\nA measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components `L_1z` and `L_2z` will yield eigenvalues of `m1ħ` and `m2ħ`, respectively. The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring `L_1z` with an eigenvalue of `-ħ` (which means `m1 = -1`) and `L_2z` with an eigenvalue of `-ħ` (which means `m2 = -1`).\n\nIf we were to obtain this measurement outcome, the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers would be:\n`m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`\n\nThis result (`m1 + m2 = -2`) contradicts the known state of the system, where the total z-component quantum number `m` is -1. Because the z-component of the total angular momentum must be conserved, a system in a state with `m = -1` cannot produce a measurement outcome corresponding to a total `m` of -2. The initial state is an eigenstate of the total `L_z` operator with eigenvalue `-ħ`, while the desired final state is an eigenstate of the same operator but with a different eigenvalue, `-2ħ`. Since eigenstates corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, the probability of this transition is zero.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L_1z` and `L_2z` as `-ħ` is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>"
