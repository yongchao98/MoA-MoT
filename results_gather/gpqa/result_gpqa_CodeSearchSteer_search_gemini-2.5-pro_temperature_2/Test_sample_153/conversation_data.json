    "Based on the thorough analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **Analysis Breakdown**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound.\n    *   The presence of a peak at **m/z = 158** with a relative intensity of about one-third of the molecular ion peak is a distinct isotopic pattern indicating the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad absorption observed between **3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm** integrating to one proton (1H) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and another doublet at **7.72 ppm (2H)**, are classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two sets of protons, each containing two equivalent protons, split each other into doublets. This pattern confirms the para-substitution.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nEach piece of spectral data converges on the same structure. The mass spectrum confirms a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of chlorine. The IR spectrum identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the carboxylic acid proton and reveals a para-substituted aromatic ring. Among the choices provided, only **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all of these spectral features.\n\n<<<D>>>"
