    "To determine the time it will take for the 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth, we must first establish the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and then apply the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud**\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. Various astronomical measurements have been made to determine its distance from Earth. Recent studies have provided a precise measurement of approximately 163,000 light-years. Other sources place the distance between 160,000 and 179,000 light-years. For this calculation, we will use the value of 163,000 light-years.\n\n**2. Time of Travel from Earth's Perspective**\nFirst, we calculate the travel time from the perspective of a stationary observer on Earth. The spacecraft's speed is a constant 0.99999987 *c*. Since a light-year is the distance light travels in one year, a spacecraft traveling at nearly the speed of light will take slightly longer than the distance in light-years.\n\n*   **Time (Earth Frame) = Distance / Speed**\n*   Time (Earth Frame) ≈ 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 *c*\n*   Time (Earth Frame) ≈ 163,000.2119 years\n\nFrom Earth's perspective, the journey takes approximately 163,000 years.\n\n**3. Time of Travel from the Astronaut's Perspective (Time Dilation)**\nFor the astronaut traveling at a relativistic speed, time will pass much more slowly. This phenomenon is known as time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\n*   **T₀ = T * √(1 - v²/c²)**\n\nWhere:\n*   T₀ is the proper time experienced by the astronaut.\n*   T is the time measured by the stationary observer on Earth (163,000.2119 years).\n*   v is the velocity of the spacecraft (0.99999987 *c*).\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\nNow, we can calculate the time experienced by the astronaut:\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   v²/c² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.00000026\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.00051\n\n*   T₀ ≈ 163,000.2119 * 0.00051\n*   T₀ ≈ 83.13 years\n\nFrom the astronaut's perspective, the journey to Earth will take approximately 83.13 years.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe astronaut is 22 years old when the journey begins. The trip will take roughly 83.13 years from their point of view.\n\n*   **Astronaut's age upon arrival = Initial age + Travel time**\n*   Astronaut's age upon arrival ≈ 22 + 83.13 = 105.13 years\n\nSince the astronaut's average lifetime is 150 solar years, they will survive the journey, arriving on Earth at the age of approximately 105. The travel time itself is about 83 years, which aligns with option B after rounding.\n\n<<<B>>>"
