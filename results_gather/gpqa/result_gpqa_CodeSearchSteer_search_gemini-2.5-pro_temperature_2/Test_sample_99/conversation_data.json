    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Compound A (C3H6) → Compound B:** Compound A, with the formula C3H6, is propene. It undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride, an addition reaction, to form 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B).\n2.  **Compound B → Compound C:** 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH) in a dehydrohalogenation reaction to form propyne (Compound C).\n3.  **Compound C → Compound D:** Propyne (Compound C), when passed through a red-hot iron tube, undergoes cyclic trimerization to form 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which is also known as mesitylene (Compound D).\n4.  **Compound D → Compound E:** Mesitylene (Compound D) reacts with a nitrating mixture (concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid) to form 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene (Compound E).\n5.  **Compound E → Compound F:** 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene (Compound E) is reduced using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, also known as mesitylamine (Compound F).\n6.  **Compound F → Compound G:** 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Compound F) reacts with nitrous acid (NaNO2 + HCl) at low temperatures in a diazotization reaction to form 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride (Compound G).\n7.  **Compound G → Compound H:** The diazonium salt (Compound G) reacts with sodium hydroxide upon warming to form 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (Compound H).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n*   **A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.** Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the molecule's symmetry, the three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and produce a single peak (singlet). Similarly, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are also equivalent and result in another single peak (singlet). Therefore, mesitylene shows two singlets in its 1H NMR spectrum. This statement is **correct**.\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.** Compound C is propyne. It is a colorless, highly flammable gas with a boiling point of -23.1 °C, meaning it is a gas at room temperature. This statement is **correct**.\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.** Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is used to detect phenols, typically yielding a red, blue, green, or purple color. However, some phenols, especially those with bulky groups at the ortho positions (like the methyl groups in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol), are sterically hindered and may not give a positive test. If no reaction occurs, the solution would retain the original yellow color of the ferric chloride solution. A yellow color does not indicate the characteristic positive test for a phenol. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n*   **D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.** Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines like this are known precursors in the production of dyes. Specifically, it is used to produce dyes such as Acid Blue 129. This statement is **correct**.\n\nThe incorrect statement is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
