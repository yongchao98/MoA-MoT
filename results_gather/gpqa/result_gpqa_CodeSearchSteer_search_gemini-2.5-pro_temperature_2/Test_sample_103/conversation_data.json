    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by observing the wobble of their host star. This wobble, a periodic change in the star's velocity along our line of sight, causes a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_star). The amplitude of this velocity variation is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as K.\n    Therefore, the amplitude of the wavelength shift is directly proportional to K.\n    *   K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n    This gives us the ratio of the velocity amplitudes: K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of a star orbited by a single planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) is:\n    K = (Mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   Mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Relationship:** The problem states that the stars have identical masses (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂) and the planets have similar masses (Mₚ₁ ≈ Mₚ₂). In the RV method, the measurable quantity is Mₚ sin(i), the minimum mass. It is a standard assumption in such problems to consider Mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ Mₚ₂ sin(i₂).\n\n    Given these conditions, most terms in the formula are constant for both systems. The relationship between K and P simplifies to:\n    K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** From the relationship K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³, we can express the period P in terms of K:\n    P ∝ K⁻³ or P ∝ 1/K³\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 (P₂) to that of planet #1 (P₁):\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₂)⁻³ / (K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Substituting the Values:** We already established that K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7. Substituting this into the equation for the period ratio:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>"
