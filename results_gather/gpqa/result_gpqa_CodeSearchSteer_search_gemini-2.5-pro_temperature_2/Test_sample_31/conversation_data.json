    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and Its Mass\n*   The nucleus is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium's atomic number (Z) is 3, which means it contains 3 protons.\n*   The number of neutrons (N) is given as 3.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Thus, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n*   The atomic mass of a ⁶Li atom is 6.0151228 atomic mass units (u).\n*   To find the mass of the nucleus, we must subtract the mass of the atom's 3 electrons. The mass of a single electron is approximately 0.00054858 u.\n*   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 × 0.00054858 u = 0.00164574 u.\n*   Mass of the ⁶Li nucleus (m₀) = Atomic mass of ⁶Li - Mass of 3 electrons\n    m₀ = 6.0151228 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.01347706 u.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀)\nThe rest energy is calculated using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, E₀ = m₀c². We first need to convert the nucleus's mass from atomic mass units (u) to GeV/c².\n*   The conversion factor is 1 u ≈ 0.9314941 GeV/c².\n*   Rest Mass in GeV/c² = 6.01347706 u × 0.9314941 GeV/c²/u ≈ 5.6014 GeV/c².\n*   Therefore, the rest energy (E₀) is **5.6014 GeV**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe speed of the nucleus is given as v = 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor (γ) measures the relativistic effect at this speed.\n*   The formula is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   Substituting v = 0.96c:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    γ = 1 / 0.28\n    γ ≈ **3.5714**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)\nThe total energy of the moving nucleus is the product of its rest energy and the Lorentz factor.\n*   E = γ × E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 × 5.6014 GeV\n*   E ≈ **20.005 GeV**\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculated total energy of the ⁶Li nucleus is approximately 20.005 GeV. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 21.419 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 18.475 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.005 GeV is closest to option B, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (about 0.6%) may result from the specific values of physical constants used to derive the question options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
