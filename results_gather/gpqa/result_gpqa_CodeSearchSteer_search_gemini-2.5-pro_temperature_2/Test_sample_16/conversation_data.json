    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Reaction and Formation Constant**\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f), also called the stability constant, for this reaction is given as K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰. The large value of K_f indicates that the complex is very stable and favors formation.\n\n**2. Dissociation Equilibrium**\nThe problem requires finding the free Ca²⁺ concentration, which results from the dissociation of the complex. Dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n**3. Dissociation Constant (K_d)**\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f):\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**4. Equilibrium Calculation**\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates from the complex.\n\n*   **Reaction:** [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n*   **Initial (I):** 0.02 M, 0 M, 0 M\n*   **Change (C):** -x, +x, +x\n*   **Equilibrium (E):** (0.02 - x) M, x M, x M\n\nThe problem assumes an ideal pH, which simplifies the calculation by allowing the use of the overall formation constant without adjusting for the protonation of EDTA.\n\n**5. Solving for Calcium Ion Concentration**\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\nK_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant is very small, meaning 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can simplify the denominator:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / 0.02\n\nNow, solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx² = (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² = 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>"
