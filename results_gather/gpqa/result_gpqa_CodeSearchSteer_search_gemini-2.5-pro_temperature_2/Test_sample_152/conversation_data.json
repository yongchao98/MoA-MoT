  "question": "α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a breakdown of the three reactions:\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)**\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes an acidic α-hydrogen from dimethyl malonate to create a nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n*   **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate in a classic Michael addition. The intermediate is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent.\n*   **Product (A):** The new bond forms between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. This results in the formation of **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) → (B)**\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophile in a process known as the Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael addition. The α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) is the nucleophilic center.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Reaction:** The enamine adds to the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. Following the addition, an acidic workup with H₃O⁺ hydrolyzes the resulting iminium ion back to a ketone.\n*   **Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the alpha position. The systematic name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is a retrosynthesis problem. We are given the product and the Michael acceptor and must identify the starting Michael donor (C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Reaction:** The product is formed by adding a nucleophile to the β-carbon of MVK. The added fragment is `–CH₂CH₂COCH₃`, which originates from `CH₂=CHCOCH₃`. The new C-C bond is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. This C2 position is highly acidic due to the two adjacent carbonyl groups, making it an excellent Michael donor after deprotonation by the base (KOH). This specific reaction is the first step of the well-known Robinson annulation.\n*   **Reactant (C):** The Michael donor must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is the one that matches all three correct structures.\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
