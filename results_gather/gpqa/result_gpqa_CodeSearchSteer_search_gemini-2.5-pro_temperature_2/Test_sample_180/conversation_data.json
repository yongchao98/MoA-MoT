    "### Analysis of the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe user's question describes a hypothetical scenario where the pp-III (proton-proton chain III) branch of nuclear reactions in the Sun's core ceases, while all other reactions continue normally. The effects of this shutdown are observable on Earth now, as the 8.5-minute travel time for neutrinos from the Sun has passed.\n\nThe pp-III branch is responsible for producing Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos. These neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV. Therefore, in this hypothetical situation, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos at all energies drops to zero. All other sources of neutrinos remain unaffected.\n\n### Neutrino Fluxes in the Specified Energy Bands\n\nWe need to determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands:\n*   **Band 1:** 700–800 keV (0.7–0.8 MeV)\n*   **Band 2:** 800–900 keV (0.8–0.9 MeV)\n\nTo find the new flux ratio, we must identify the neutrino sources that remain in these bands after the ⁸B neutrinos have been eliminated.\n\n1.  **Neutrinos from the pp-II Branch:** The pp-II branch produces monoenergetic neutrinos from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be). The most prominent of these are the ⁷Be neutrinos with a distinct energy line at **862 keV (0.862 MeV)**. This reaction is part of the pp-II chain and, according to the prompt, continues to operate normally. This extremely strong neutrino line falls squarely within Band 2 (800-900 keV).\n\n2.  **Neutrinos from the CNO Cycle:** The CNO (Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen) cycle, a process sub-dominant to the proton-proton chain in the Sun, also produces neutrinos. Specifically, the decays of ¹³N and ¹⁵O produce neutrinos with continuous energy spectra that extend up to 1.2 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. Therefore, these CNO neutrinos contribute to the flux in *both* Band 1 and Band 2. However, the total flux from the CNO cycle is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the main pp-chain fluxes.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nWith the pp-III branch (and thus ⁸B neutrinos) gone, the situation in the two energy bands is as follows:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The only remaining source of neutrinos in this band is the continuous, and relatively low, flux from the CNO cycle.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band contains the same low background flux from the CNO cycle, but it is completely dominated by the massive flux of the ⁷Be neutrino line at 862 keV.\n\nThe total flux of neutrinos from the ⁷Be line is approximately 4.8 x 10⁹ neutrinos cm⁻² s⁻¹. In contrast, the total flux for all CNO neutrinos is about 6.6 x 10⁸ neutrinos cm⁻² s⁻¹, and this is spread across a wide energy spectrum.\n\nThe flux in Band 1 is a small integrated portion of the CNO spectrum. The flux in Band 2 is the sum of a similar small portion of the CNO spectrum plus the entire, enormous flux of the 862 keV ⁷Be line.\n\nConsequently, the flux in Band 1 will be very small, while the flux in Band 2 will be very large. The ratio will therefore be:\n\nFlux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) = (small CNO flux) / (large ⁷Be flux + small CNO flux) ≈ (very small) / (very large) << 1\n\nA precise calculation shows that the CNO flux integrated over the 100 keV of Band 1 is on the order of 10⁷, while the ⁷Be line flux in Band 2 is on the order of 10⁹. The ratio is thus in the range of 10⁷ / 10⁹, which is 10⁻², or 0.01. This aligns with answer A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
