    "### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal indicates the presence of a methyl group (3H) that is not coupled to any neighboring protons (singlet). The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃-C=O).\n\n2.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These signals are in the chemical shift region typical for alkene or vinylic protons (protons attached to a double bond). The total integration is for two protons (1H + 1H).\n\n3.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz):** This vinylic proton is split into a doublet, meaning it is coupled to only one other proton. The key piece of information is the coupling constant, J, which has a value of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for protons across a double bond are stereochemically dependent. A large coupling constant, typically in the range of 12-18 Hz, is indicative of a *trans* relationship between the two protons. Cis coupling constants are smaller, generally ranging from 6-12 Hz. Therefore, the J value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests a trans-alkene.\n\n4.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This vinylic proton is coupled to two different sets of protons.\n    *   The \"doublet\" part of the signal is due to coupling with the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm) and will share the same coupling constant (J ≈ 16.0 Hz).\n    *   The \"quartet\" part indicates that this proton is also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group), following the n+1 rule (3+1=4 lines, a quartet).\n\n5.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal represents a methyl group (3H) that is coupled to one proton (n+1 rule: 1+1=2 lines, a doublet). This is the methyl group that is splitting the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm into a quartet. Its position at ~1.6 ppm is consistent with an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond).\n\n### Structure Determination\n\n*   The data indicates an acetate group (`CH₃-C(=O)-O-`) from the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n*   The data also points to a propenyl group (`CH₃-CH=CH-`). The `CH₃` is the doublet at 1.6 ppm, the `CH` next to it is the dq at 5.5 ppm, and the final `CH` is the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n*   The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons confirms a *trans* configuration.\n\nPutting the pieces together, the unknown compound is **trans-propenyl acetate**. The IUPAC name is (1E)-prop-1-en-1-yl acetate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe compound's structure is determined by the combination of an acetate group, a propenyl group, and the *trans* stereochemistry of the double bond. This matches the description of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
