    "Here is a breakdown of the reaction to determine the final product:\n\n1.  **Reactants Analysis**:\n    *   **Substrate**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring. The carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   **Reagent**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), also known as a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n\n2.  **Reaction Type**: Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n3.  **Key Principles**:\n    *   **Regioselectivity**: The prompt correctly states that with organocuprates, the nucleophile attacks the *less sterically hindered* carbon of the epoxide. This is a standard Sₙ2-type reaction.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds with *inversion of configuration* at the carbon that is attacked, which is characteristic of an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n\n4.  **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n\n    *   **Identify the attack site**: We need to compare the steric hindrance at the two epoxide carbons, C1 and C6.\n        *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group in addition to being part of the bicyclic ring system.\n        *   C6 has no substituents other than ring hydrogens.\n        *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon** and will be attacked by the methyl nucleophile from the Me₂CuLi.\n\n    *   **Determine the product's connectivity**:\n        *   The nucleophilic methyl group forms a new bond with C6.\n        *   The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n        *   The epoxide oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup (which is implied), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   The final product is a tertiary alcohol where the carbon bearing the -OH group (C1) also has a methyl group.\n        *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are unchanged.\n        *   The new methyl group is at C6.\n\n    *   **Determine IUPAC Name and eliminate options**:\n        *   The carbon with the hydroxyl group is designated C1 in IUPAC nomenclature. This is the original C1 of the starting material.\n        *   The adjacent carbon that was attacked (original C6) can be numbered C2.\n        *   The methyl groups are located on the original C1 (now new C1), original C6 (now new C2), original C3 (now new C4), and original C4 (now new C5).\n        *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n        *   This analysis eliminates options C and D, which have a 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl substitution pattern.\n\n    *   **Determine the Stereochemistry**:\n        *   **Initial Stereocenters**: (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). Let's assume the epoxide ring is on the 'top' (beta) face of the cyclohexane chair for visualization.\n        *   **Stereocenters Unchanged**: The configurations at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction and remain **3R** and **4R** (which correspond to 4R and 5R in the product's IUPAC name).\n        *   **Stereocenter at C1**: The C1-O bond breaks, but the configuration of the substituents around C1 relative to the ring is maintained. So, the original **1R** configuration is preserved.\n        *   **Stereocenter at C6 (new C2)**: The reaction involves an Sₙ2 attack on C6. This attack must occur from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack) and results in an inversion of configuration at C6.\n        *   To find the final configuration at the new C2, we must consider the initial (6S) configuration and the backside attack. The epoxide is *syn* (cis-fused) to the ring. If the epoxide oxygen is 'up' (axial), the C6-H is 'down' (equatorial). The attack will occur from the 'down' side. The incoming methyl group will end up 'down' (axial), pushing the C6 carbon 'up'. The original (6S) configuration at the bridgehead inverts. This inversion leads to a specific orientation of the new methyl group relative to the other groups. Through careful 3D modeling, this inversion at C6 (6S) results in a **(2R)** configuration in the final product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The resulting product retains the configuration at C1, C4, and C5 (new numbering) and has an inverted configuration at C2 (new numbering).\n    *   The final product's stereochemistry is: **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n    *   This corresponds to the name: **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nTherefore, the correct product is B. This is also confirmed by a similar problem found in a dataset which states the correct answer to be (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
