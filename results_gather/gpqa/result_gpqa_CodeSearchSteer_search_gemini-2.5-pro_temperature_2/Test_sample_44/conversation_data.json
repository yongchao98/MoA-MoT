    "To determine the energies of the system, we must first understand the behavior of the four identical spin-1/2 particles within the one-dimensional infinite potential well. As spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the energy of each single-particle state `n` is simplified to:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nAccording to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can accommodate at most two fermions, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**Ground State Energy:**\nTo find the ground state energy, the four fermions must be placed into the lowest possible energy levels.\n*   Two particles occupy the n=1 level, with an energy of 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles occupy the n=2 level, with an energy of 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum: 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**First Excited State Energy:**\nTo achieve the first excited state, we promote one fermion from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3) with the smallest possible energy increase.\n*   Two particles remain in the n=1 level, with an energy of 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level, with an energy of 1 × (2²E) = 4E.\n*   One particle is promoted to the n=3 level, with an energy of 1 × (3²E) = 9E.\n*   The total energy of the first excited state is: 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy:**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. There are a few possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n1.  **Promoting one particle from n=1 to n=3:**\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy: (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n2.  **Promoting both particles from n=2 to n=3:**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy: (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  **Promoting one particle from n=2 to n=4:**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy: (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing these energies, the lowest energy level above the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Therefore, this is the energy of the second excited state.\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
