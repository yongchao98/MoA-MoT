    "To solve this problem, we will apply the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n### 1. Initial Energy (E_initial)\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slow-moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is negligible and can be considered zero. To conserve momentum in the system, we assume the proton is also effectively at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass of a proton is identical to that of an antiproton. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV.\n\nSo, the total initial energy is:\n$E_{initial} = m_{p}c^{2} + m_{\\bar{p}}c^{2} = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nWhen a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, their total mass is converted into energy, in this case, a total of 1876 MeV.\n\n### 2. Final Energy (E_final)\nThe annihilation results in four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Assuming momentum is conserved and the initial momentum was zero, the four resulting particles will share the total energy equally.\n\nTherefore, the energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is:\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Velocity\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle ($E_A$) is the sum of its rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) and its kinetic energy. It is given by the equation:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nWe are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nNow, we can find the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n$469 \\text{ MeV} = \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{469}{300} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nFinally, we solve for the velocity ($v$):\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2}$\n$1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4439}}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092}$\n$v = c \\sqrt{0.5908}$\n$v \\approx 0.7686 c$\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe calculated velocity, approximately 0.769c, is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
