    "This is a multi-step stoichiometry problem. Here's a systematic breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gas Mixture\nThe initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes, which helps identify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) to form a precipitate, causing a mass change. Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the tube, 0.80 g, is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the removal of water and oxygen, 2.24 L of a non-acidic, unreactive gas C remains. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow, we can determine the molar mass of Gas C and identify it.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol\nA diatomic gas with this molar mass is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determine the Composition of the Salts\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts A and B must contain Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N) atoms. Since heating produced *only* a mixture of gases, with no solid residue, the salts are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen containing acids.\n\nLet's calculate the total moles of each element in the products:\n*   **Moles of N atoms:** 0.1 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = 0.2 mol N\n*   **Moles of H atoms:** 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H\n*   **Moles of O atoms:** (0.2 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O\n\nThe empirical formula of the combined salts A and B is N₀.₂H₀.₄O₀.₂₅. To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20, which gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe problem states we started with an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Therefore, the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B must be N₄H₈O₅. The most plausible candidates for ammonium salts containing N, H, and O are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n*   Formula of Ammonium Nitrite (A): **N₂H₄O₂**\n*   Formula of Ammonium Nitrate (B): **N₂H₄O₃**\n\nAdding these two formulas together:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis perfectly matches the empirical formula derived from the products, confirming that salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### 3. Verify the Decomposition Reactions\nLet's check if the decomposition of these two salts produces the observed moles of gases.\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite is: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   Ammonium nitrate typically decomposes to N₂O and H₂O. However, under certain conditions, an alternative decomposition occurs which fits our products: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nThe mixture was equimolar. Let's find the number of moles ('x') for each salt. The total amount of oxygen (0.025 mol) was produced solely from the decomposition of ammonium nitrate.\n*   Based on the reaction, 2 moles of NH₄NO₃ produce 1 mole of O₂. So, `x` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces `x/2` moles of O₂.\n*   x/2 = 0.025 mol O₂   =>   x = 0.05 mol.\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. This confirms the mixture was equimolar.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms\n\n**Total number of atoms = 8 (from salt A) + 9 (from salt B) = 17**\n\n<<<D>>>"
