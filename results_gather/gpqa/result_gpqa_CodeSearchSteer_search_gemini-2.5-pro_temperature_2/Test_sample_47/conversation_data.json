    "Based on the provided reaction sequence, we can deduce the structure of product 4 through a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\nWhen 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This is a characteristic reaction of α-halo ketones which results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative. The product of this reaction is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (which exists as its sodium salt, sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate, in the basic solution). For the next step, we'll consider the free acid, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, as product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The product (3) is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\nCyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced by Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃). This is a mild reducing agent that is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the corresponding alcohol. Therefore, product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4:**\nProduct 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must look at the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nThe molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon-hydrogen bond of the aldehyde group, the carbon to which it is attached (C1), and bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n1.  The **aldehyde proton** (-CHO) is unique.\n2.  The **proton on C1** (the carbon of the ring bonded to the aldehyde) is unique.\n3.  The two protons on **C2** are chemically equivalent to the two protons on **C5**. Within the pair of protons on C2 (or C5), they are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other). This gives us two distinct types of hydrogen atoms for the C2/C5 positions.\n4.  Similarly, the two protons on **C3** are chemically equivalent to the two protons on **C4**. The two protons on C3 (or C4) are also diastereotopic. This gives us another two distinct types of hydrogen atoms for the C3/C4 positions.\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, product 4 has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
