    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the momentum of the absorbed photon.\n\n**1. Identify the Transition**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, where both the vibrational quantum number (v) and the rotational quantum number (J) are at their lowest possible values: v=0 and J=0.\n*   **Final State:** The question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". For a photon to be absorbed and excite a vibrational mode, the selection rules for rovibrational spectroscopy typically apply. These rules state that for the most common transitions (infrared absorption), the change in the vibrational quantum number is Δv = +1, and the change in the rotational quantum number is ΔJ = ±1.\n*   Starting from J=0, a transition of ΔJ = -1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed transition is ΔJ = +1, which means the final rotational state is J=1.\n*   The final state is thus v=1 and J=1. This type of transition is known as the R-branch of the spectrum.\n\n**2. Energy of the Transition**\n\nThe energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * J(J+1)\n\n*   **E_initial** (v=0, J=0) = ħω(0.5) + 0 = 0.5 ħω\n*   **E_final** (v=1, J=1) = ħω(1.5) + [ħ² / (2I)] * 1(1+1) = 1.5 ħω + ħ²/I\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) must equal the difference between these two states:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = (1.5 ħω + ħ²/I) - 0.5 ħω\nΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n**3. Calculate Necessary Physical Constants**\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    Converting to kg: μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μ * R²\n    I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy Terms**\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term (ħω):**\n    ħ (Reduced Planck Constant) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Term (ħ²/I):**\n    ħ² ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴)² ≈ 1.111 x 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²\n    ħ²/I = (1.111 x 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²) / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n**5. Calculate Total Photon Energy (ΔE)**\n\nNow, we add the two energy components. Notice that the rotational energy term is significantly smaller than the vibrational energy term.\n\nΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\nΔE ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.20 x 10⁻²³ J)\nΔE ≈ 4.216092 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n**6. Calculate Photon Momentum (p)**\n\nThe energy and momentum of a photon are related by the equation E = pc, where c is the speed of light.\n\np = ΔE / c\nc (Speed of Light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\np = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value is very close to the value given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
