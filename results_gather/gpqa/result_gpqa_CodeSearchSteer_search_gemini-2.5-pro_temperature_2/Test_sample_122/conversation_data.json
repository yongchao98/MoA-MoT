    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically concerning time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference and given values:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) is the stationary frame.\n    *   The ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S') is the moving frame.\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that has passed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n3.  **Relate distance, velocity, and time in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    *   The distance is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time interval as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    *   According to special relativity, time passes differently in different inertial frames. The time measured in the stationary frame (S) is related to the proper time in the moving frame (S') by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, about 51.03 seconds pass in the Galaxy.\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\nAlternatively, for a more precise calculation without intermediate rounding:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt') = 60,000 * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option A. The small difference is due to rounding in the provided option. Note that the non-relativistic calculation would be `d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C). Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame is longer, so the distance covered must be greater than 3,000,000 km. This eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving A as the only logical choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
