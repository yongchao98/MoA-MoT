    "To determine the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy gained per acceleration:**\n    The proton is accelerated each time it crosses the gap between the \"dees\" of the synchrocyclotron. The energy gained during a single crossing (ΔT_crossing) depends on the charge of the particle (q) and the instantaneous voltage (U) at that moment. The charge of a proton is equal to the elementary charge, *e*.\n\n    The instantaneous voltage is given by:\n    U(t) = U₀ cos[2πν(α)t + Φ₀]\n\n    The energy gain per crossing is therefore:\n    ΔT_crossing = q * U = e * U₀ cos(Φ₀)\n\n    We are given:\n    *   U₀ = 190 kV = 190 * 10³ V\n    *   Φ₀ = π / 4\n\n    So, the energy gained in one crossing, expressed in electron-volts (eV), is:\n    ΔT_crossing = (190 * 10³ V) * cos(π/4)\n    ΔT_crossing = 190 * (1/√2) keV ≈ 134.35 keV\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy gained per revolution:**\n    In a cyclotron or synchrocyclotron, the particle crosses the accelerating gap twice per revolution. Therefore, the total energy gained in one full revolution (ΔT_rev) is twice the energy gained per crossing.\n\n    ΔT_rev = 2 * ΔT_crossing\n    ΔT_rev = 2 * 190 * cos(π/4) keV\n    ΔT_rev = 380 * cos(π/4) keV\n    ΔT_rev = 380 * (1/√2) keV ≈ 268.7 keV\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of revolutions:**\n    The total kinetic energy gained by the proton is given as T₁ = 950 MeV. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (T ≈ 0). The total number of revolutions (N) is the total energy gained divided by the energy gained per revolution.\n\n    N = T₁ / ΔT_rev\n\n    First, ensure the energy units are consistent. Let's convert everything to MeV:\n    *   T₁ = 950 MeV\n    *   ΔT_rev ≈ 268.7 keV = 0.2687 MeV\n\n    Now, we can calculate N:\n    N = 950 MeV / (380 * cos(π/4) keV)\n    N = 950,000 keV / (380 * cos(π/4) keV)\n    N = 950,000 / (380 / √2)\n    N = (950,000 * √2) / 380\n    N ≈ (950,000 * 1.41421) / 380\n    N ≈ 1,343,500 / 380\n    N ≈ 3535.53\n\n    Since the number of revolutions must be an integer, we round the result to the nearest whole number, which is 3536.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2500\nB) 1864\nC) 5300\nD) 3536\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
