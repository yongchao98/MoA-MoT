    "The problem asks for the maximum speed of a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. To solve this, we can use the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n### 1. Define the Total Energy\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle in a potential field in special relativity is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy (U).\n*   The total relativistic energy of a particle with mass *m* and velocity *v* is given by E_rel = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is $1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$.\n*   The potential energy (U) for a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's Law (F = -kx) is $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nTherefore, the total conserved energy of the system is $E = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. Some sources consider the total energy to be the sum of kinetic and potential energy, $E_{total} = (\\gamma-1)mc^2 + U$. In this framework, energy stored in an object, including potential energy, contributes to its total rest mass, and thus its total energy. Both approaches lead to the same result through the principle of energy conservation. This is because the rest energy $mc^2$ is a constant term.\n\n### 2. Apply the Conservation of Energy\n\nWe will equate the total energy at two key points in the oscillator's motion:\n*   **At the point of maximum amplitude (x = A):** The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed *v* = 0. This means the Lorentz factor γ = 1.\n*   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):** The mass has its maximum speed, *v* = v_max. The potential energy is zero.\n\n**Energy at x = A:**\nAt the maximum amplitude, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and the relativistic energy equals the rest energy, $mc^2$. The potential energy is at its maximum.\n$E_{total} = mc^2 + U(A)$\n$E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n**Energy at x = 0:**\nAt the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, and the speed is maximum ($v_{max}$). The relativistic energy is at its maximum.\n$E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + U(0)$\n$E_{total} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}mc^2 + 0$\n\n**Equating the energies:**\nBy the principle of energy conservation, the total energy at both points must be the same.\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n### 3. Solve for the Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$)\n\nNow, we solve the equation for $v_{max}$:\n\n1.  Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n2.  Let $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$. The equation becomes:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n3.  To find $v_{max}$, we need to rearrange the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$. Square both sides of the equation from step 1:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n5.  Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n6.  Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe derived expression for the maximum speed matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
