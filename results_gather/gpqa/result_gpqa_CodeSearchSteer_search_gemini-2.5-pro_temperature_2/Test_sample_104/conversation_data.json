    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Signal Amplitude from the Spotted Star\n\nFirst, we need to determine the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating star. The variation is due to the difference in flux between the unspotted hemisphere and the hemisphere partially covered by spots.\n\n*   **Star's effective temperature (T_eff):** 6000 K\n*   **Spot temperature (T_spot):** T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere (f_spot):** 20% or 0.20\n\nAccording to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux (F) radiated from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T⁴). We are interested in the relative difference in flux between the two hemispheres as they rotate into view.\n\n1.  **Flux from the unspotted hemisphere (F_max):** This side is uniform, so its flux is proportional to its area multiplied by its effective temperature to the fourth power.\n    `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`\n\n2.  **Flux from the spotted hemisphere (F_min):** This side's flux is a combination of the hot photosphere and the cooler spots.\n    *   The fraction of the area that is unspotted is `(1 - f_spot) = 0.80`.\n    *   The fraction of the area covered by spots is `f_spot = 0.20`.\n    *   The total flux from this hemisphere is `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`.\n\nThe amplitude of the light curve signal is the relative drop in flux when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer, compared to the unspotted hemisphere.\n\n*   **Amplitude (Spots)** = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\n\n*   Amplitude (Spots) = [ T_eff⁴ - ( (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴ ) ] / T_eff⁴\n*   Amplitude (Spots) = [ T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴ ] / T_eff⁴\n*   Amplitude (Spots) = [ f_spot * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) ] / T_eff⁴\n*   **Amplitude (Spots) = f_spot * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]**\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n*   Amplitude (Spots) = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5000 K / 6000 K)⁴ ]\n*   Amplitude (Spots) = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\n*   Amplitude (Spots) = 0.20 * [ 1 - (625 / 1296) ]\n*   Amplitude (Spots) = 0.20 * [ (1296 - 625) / 1296 ]\n*   Amplitude (Spots) = 0.20 * (671 / 1296) ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the brightness of the star varies by approximately 10.36% due to the rotating spotty hemisphere.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Signal Amplitude from a Transiting Exoplanet\n\nNext, we need the formula for the signal produced by a transiting exoplanet. When an exoplanet passes in front of its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip, or the amplitude of the signal, is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   **Amplitude (Planet)** = (Area of Planet) / (Area of Star)\n*   Amplitude (Planet) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n*   **Amplitude (Planet) = (R_pl / R_star)²**\n\nHere, `R_pl` is the radius of the planet and `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n\n### Step 3: Equate the Amplitudes and Solve\n\nThe problem requires finding the planet-to-star radius ratio (`R_pl / R_star`) that would produce the same signal amplitude as the spotted star.\n\n*   Amplitude (Planet) = Amplitude (Spots)\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\nTo find the radius ratio, we take the square root of the amplitude:\n\n*   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n*   **R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218**\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
