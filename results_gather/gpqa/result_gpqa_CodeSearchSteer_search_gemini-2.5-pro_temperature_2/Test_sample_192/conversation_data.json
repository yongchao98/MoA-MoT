    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars changes with distance.\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars observed, when measured per unit of parallax (`plx`), varies as the inverse fifth power of the parallax. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    *   Number of stars per unit parallax ∝ `1/plx⁵`\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    Parallax and distance are inversely related. The distance to a star (`r`) in parsecs is defined as the reciprocal of its parallax angle (`plx`) in arcseconds.\n    *   `r = 1/plx`  or  `plx = 1/r`\n\n3.  **Connect the Variables:**\n    We want to find how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance (`r`). Let's call the number of stars `N`. We are looking for the relationship for `dN/dr`. We can use the chain rule from calculus to relate the change in star counts with respect to distance to the change in star counts with respect to parallax:\n\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n    Since star counts must be positive, and an increase in distance (`dr` > 0) leads to a decrease in parallax (`d(plx)` < 0), we use the absolute value of the derivative:\n\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r²`\n        The absolute value is `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n    *   Now, substitute the known proportionalities into the equation:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n    *   Finally, express everything in terms of the distance, `r`, by substituting `plx = 1/r`:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²) `\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance in that region of the sky changes in proportion to the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<B>>>"
