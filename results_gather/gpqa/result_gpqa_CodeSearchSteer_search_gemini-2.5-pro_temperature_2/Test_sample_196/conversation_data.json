    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\n**1. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions suggest the presence of carbon-carbon double bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\nThe IR data strongly indicates that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet in the far downfield region is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, likely a methine (-CH-) group attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position) and other alkyl groups.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, likely a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, which must be a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, which must be a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n\n    Assembling these pieces leads to a **sec-butyl** group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. The proton on the carbon attached to the ring (at 2.9 ppm) is split by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group and the two protons of the adjacent methylene group, resulting in a complex multiplet. The methyl group at 1.4 ppm is split into a doublet by the single benzylic proton. The methylene protons at 1.7 ppm are split by both the benzylic proton and the terminal methyl group, resulting in a multiplet. The terminal methyl group at 0.9 ppm is split into a triplet by the adjacent two methylene protons.\n\n**Conclusion for Compound X:** Based on the combined spectroscopic data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI\n\nThe reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reduction method. This reagent combination reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reagents:** Red P / HI\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring are unaffected by these reagents under typical conditions.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Identifying the Final Answer\n\nComparing this predicted product with the given options:\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Matches the predicted product.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect alkyl groups and substitution pattern.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
