    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and analysis of its NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Product 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n2.  **Reaction:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. This involves harsh basic conditions, suggesting elimination and rearrangement are likely.\n3.  **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone.\n    *   ¹H NMR: Total proton count is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14H. This means the molecular formula must be C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The key feature is that for the reaction C₁₀H₁₄Br₂ → C₁₀H₁₄O, there is a net replacement of `2Br` with `O`.\n    *   The NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is characteristic of vinylic protons of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n4.  **Structure Elucidation:** The reaction involves the fragmentation of the adamantane cage. A known reaction pathway for adamantane derivatives under such conditions is a fragmentation-rearrangement to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system. The structure that fits all the data (ketone, formula C₁₀H₁₄O, and two vinylic protons) is **3-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n    *   This structure has a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core (C₉).\n    *   It has an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at position 3 and a ketone group (C=O) at position 7.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O, which has the required 14 protons. The degrees of unsaturation are 4 (2 rings + 1 C=C + 1 C=O), matching the formula (C₁₀H₂₂ - C₁₀H₁₄ = H₈ difference = 4 DU).\n    *   The two vinylic protons of the =CH₂ group account for the signal at 4.79 ppm.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Product 2\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (3-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**.\n2.  **Transformation:** The MPV reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. It is chemoselective and will not reduce the carbon-carbon double bond of the methylene group. The ketone at C-7 is reduced to a secondary alcohol.\n3.  **Structure of Product 2:** **3-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identification of Product 3\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (3-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive **ozonolysis** reaction.\n2.  **Transformation:** Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. The exocyclic methylene group (C=CH₂) is cleaved. The ring carbon becomes a ketone (C=O), and the external CH₂ group becomes formaldehyde (H₂C=O), which is typically lost or removed during workup.\n3.  **Structure of Product 3:** **7-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n1.  **Structure of Product 3:** 7-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C7, and C9.\n2.  **Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the non-exchangeable proton (C-H) in the most deshielded environment is the one on the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (the C7 proton, let's call it H7). Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen atom. Protons alpha to the ketone (at C2 and C4) would be next, around 2.5 ppm.\n3.  **Coupling Pattern of H7:** To determine the coupling pattern (multiplicity) of H7, we need to count its non-equivalent neighbors. H7 is bonded to C7, which is adjacent to C6 and C8. Both C6 and C8 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H7 to the two protons on C6 is identical to its coupling to the two protons on C8.\n    *   However, within each CH₂ group (e.g., at C6), the two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like in the chair conformation) are not equivalent to each other. They will have different dihedral angles with respect to H7.\n    *   Let's call the two protons on C6 as H6ₐ and H6ₑ, and on C8 as H8ₐ and H8ₑ.\n    *   Due to symmetry, `J(H7-H6ₐ)` will be equal to `J(H7-H8ₐ)`. Let's call this coupling constant J₁.\n    *   Similarly, `J(H7-H6ₑ)` will be equal to `J(H7-H8ₑ)`. Let's call this coupling constant J₂.\n    *   According to the Karplus relationship, the coupling constants J₁ and J₂ will be different because the dihedral angles are different (typically one trans/diaxial coupling is large, and one gauche/axial-equatorial is small).\n4.  **Resulting Splitting:** H7 is coupled to *two* equivalent protons with a coupling constant J₁ and *two* other equivalent protons with a different coupling constant J₂.\n    *   Coupling with the first pair (with constant J₁) splits the signal into a triplet (1:2:1 ratio).\n    *   Each of these three lines is then further split into a triplet by the second pair (with constant J₂).\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
