    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider the specific observing constraints of each instrument: the star's brightness (apparent V magnitude) and its position in the sky (declination).\n\nFirst, let's establish the requirements for a star to be observable by both facilities:\n\n*   **Brightness Constraint**: A star must be bright enough for both instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 17.\n    *   HIRES can observe stars brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 16.\n    *   Therefore, to be seen by both, a star must have an **apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16.0**.\n\n*   **Location Constraint**: The star must be visible from both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The problem states to disregard pointing limits, which is interpreted as meaning as long as the star is physically above the horizon, it is observable.\n    *   Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO) is in Chile, at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. It can observe the entire southern celestial hemisphere and into the northern hemisphere up to a declination of about +65.4°.\n    *   W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES) is in Hawaii, at a latitude of about 19.8° North. It can observe the entire northern celestial hemisphere and into the southern hemisphere down to a declination of about -70.2°.\n    *   Thus, for a star to be visible from both sites, its declination must be between **-70.2° and +65.4°**.\n\nNext, we calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and check its declination. The relationship between apparent magnitude (m), absolute magnitude (M), distance (d) in parsecs, and extinction (A) is given by the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5log₁₀(d/10) + A.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star:\n\n*   **Star1**: RA = 15 deg and **DEC = -75 deg**, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag, located at 10 pc distance.\n    *   **Magnitude**: The distance is 10 parsecs, where apparent and absolute magnitudes are equal by definition (and there's no extinction). So, m_V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 16.0 and thus observable by both instruments.\n    *   **Location**: Its declination of -75° is outside the observable range for Keck (-70.2°).\n    *   *Conclusion*: Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star2**: RA = 30 deg and DEC = 55 deg, **apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag**, located at 5 pc distance.\n    *   **Magnitude**: The apparent magnitude is given as 16.5. This is fainter than the 16.0 magnitude limit for HIRES.\n    *   **Location**: Its declination of +55° is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   *Conclusion*: Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star3**: RA = 11 h and **DEC = 48 deg**, **apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag**, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag, located at 15 pc.\n    *   **Magnitude**: The apparent magnitude is stated as 15.5 mag. This value represents the star's brightness as seen from Earth, including any effects of extinction. It is brighter than 16.0, making it observable by both instruments.\n    *   **Location**: Its declination of +48° is within the -70.2° to +65.4° range.\n    *   *Conclusion*: **Detectable by both observatories.**\n\n*   **Star4**: RA = 85 deg and DEC = -48 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag, located at 10 pc.\n    *   **Magnitude**: We calculate the apparent magnitude. First, find the extinction: A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag. Now, using the distance modulus: m_V = 15.5 + 5log₁₀(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag. This is fainter than HIRES's limit of 16.0.\n    *   **Location**: Its declination of -48° is within the observable range for both.\n    *   *Conclusion*: Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star5**: RA = 10 h and **DEC = 60 deg**, absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag, located at 5 pc.\n    *   **Magnitude**: We calculate the apparent magnitude (no extinction given): m_V = 16.5 + 5log₁₀(5/10) = 16.5 + 5log₁₀(0.5) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.5 = 15.0 mag. This is brighter than 16.0 and observable by both.\n    *   **Location**: Its declination of +60° is within the -70.2° to +65.4° range.\n    *   *Conclusion*: **Detectable by both observatories.**\n\nBased on these analyses, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the brightness and location criteria for detection by ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<C>>>"
