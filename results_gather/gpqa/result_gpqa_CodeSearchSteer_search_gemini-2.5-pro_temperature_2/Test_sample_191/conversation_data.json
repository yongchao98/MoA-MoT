    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Induced Charges:** The positive charge $+q$ placed inside the cavity attracts the free electrons within the conductor. As a result, a total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Charge Neutrality:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall electrical neutrality, a charge of $+q$ must appear on its outer surface.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero. This means the conductor creates a \"shield\". The charges on the outer surface are shielded from the configuration of the charges inside the cavity (the charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner wall).\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface is a sphere and is shielded from the asymmetrically placed charge inside, the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly. The electric field lines at the surface of the conductor must be perpendicular to it, and for a sphere, this means they point radially outward as if they originated from the center.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law and the shell theorem, the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n6.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P is calculated as if a point charge $+q$ were located at the center of the large sphere. The magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances $l$, $s$, and the angle $\\theta$ are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor because of the shielding effect. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nThus, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
