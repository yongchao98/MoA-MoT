    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must consider the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Target Molecule**: The target molecule is a benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). The substitution pattern is 1,3,5, meaning the bromo and nitro groups are *meta* to the acetyl group.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Substituent Effects**:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br)**: A deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Reaction Sequences**:\n\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation Limitations**: The Friedel-Crafts acylation, which introduces the acetyl group, does not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a nitro group (-NO2). It also fails with anilines (-NH2) because the amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst. This fundamental constraint immediately invalidates any sequence that attempts to add the acetyl group after nitration or to an aniline derivative.\n        *   Option A fails at step (iii) because Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline is not feasible.\n        *   Option D fails at step (iii) because Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot be performed on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, a strongly deactivated ring.\n\n    *   **Nonsensical Sequence**:\n        *   Option C involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then removal of the diazonium group with H3PO2 (steps i-iv). This sequence simply converts benzene back to benzene, making the entire option illogical.\n\n    *   **The Viable Pathway (Option B)**: Let's analyze the first three steps of option B.\n        *   **Step (i) CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is a standard and effective reaction.\n        *   **Step (ii) Br2/FeBr3**: Acetophenone is brominated. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so this reaction produces 3-bromoacetophenone in good yield.\n        *   **Step (iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone introduces a nitro group. We must consider the directing effects of both groups present:\n            *   The acetyl group at C1 is a *meta*-director, directing the new group to C5.\n            *   The bromo group at C3 is an *ortho, para*-director, directing the new group to C2, C4, and C5.\n            *   Since both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C5 position, the substitution occurs there with high selectivity and yield. This step successfully forms the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThe sequence of steps i, ii, and iii in option B provides a chemically sound and high-yield route to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) in the option are extraneous and would chemically alter the already-formed product, indicating a likely error in the question's construction. However, among the choices provided, the initial sequence of Option B is the only one that represents a correct synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
