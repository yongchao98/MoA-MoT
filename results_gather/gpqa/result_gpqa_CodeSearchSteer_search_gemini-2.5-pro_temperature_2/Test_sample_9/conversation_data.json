    "To determine which of the presented exoplanets has the highest density, a detailed analysis of each option is necessary.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This scenario describes a planet with the same physical characteristics as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density of this planet is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with a consistent composition, an increase in mass leads to greater gravitational compression of its materials. This gravitational pull results in a smaller radius than if the density were constant and, consequently, a higher overall density. Therefore, a planet that is five times more massive than Earth but made of the same materials will be significantly denser than Earth due to this compression. For rocky worlds, the radius tends to scale with mass to a power less than 1/3, which implies that density increases with mass.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with the same composition as Earth but with less mass will experience weaker gravitational compression. This will result in a lower overall density compared to Earth.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   Planet (a) has a density of about 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of about 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) will have a density significantly greater than 5.5 g/cm³ due to its higher mass and the resulting gravitational compression.\n*   Planet (d) will have a density lower than 5.5 g/cm³ due to its lower mass.\n\nBased on this analysis, the planet described in option (c) possesses the highest density among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
