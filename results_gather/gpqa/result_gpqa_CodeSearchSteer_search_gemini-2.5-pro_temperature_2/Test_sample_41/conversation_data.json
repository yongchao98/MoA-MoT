    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. For a planet in a circular orbit around a star, this temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius (a). This can be expressed as:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its orbital radius (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. For a circular orbit, this is the orbital radius:\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n\n### Derivation\n\nFrom these two principles, we can establish a direct relationship between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature.\n\n*   From the equilibrium temperature formula, we can say that the orbital radius `a` is proportional to the inverse square of the temperature:\n    *   `a ∝ 1 / T_eq²`\n*   From Kepler's Third Law, the period `P` is proportional to the orbital radius `a` to the power of 3/2:\n    *   `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n*   By substituting the expression for `a` into the expression for `P`, we find the relationship between period and temperature:\n    *   `P ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2)`\n    *   `P ∝ 1 / T_eq³`\n\nThis means that the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets (P_i and P_j) is equal to the cube of the inverse ratio of their equilibrium temperatures:\n*   P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1 (P3 / P1). Using the derived formula:\n*   P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\nFirst, we calculate the temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet3 by multiplying the given ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq3 ≈ 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\n*   P3 / P1 ≈ (3.22)³\n*   P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe additional information provided in the problem, such as the ratios of the masses and the specific albedo value, is not needed for this calculation. The fact that the albedo is the same for all planets ensures that it cancels out when taking the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures. The mass of the planets is considered negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard assumption.\n\nThus, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
