    "The physical condition for the wave function is that the total probability of finding the particle in the region where it can exist must be 1. This is known as the normalization condition. The probability is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|².\n\nThe wave function is given by:\nΨ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i\n\nThe magnitude squared, |Ψ(x)|², is calculated as:\n|Ψ(x)|² = [Re(Ψ)]² + [Im(Ψ)]²\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nSince the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, the normalization integral is:\n∫¹₃ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] evaluated from 1 to 3 = 1\n(a² * ln(4) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 1) = 1\na² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nTo find 'a', we take the square root:\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\nUsing the known value of ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na ≈ sqrt(0.5 / 0.6931)\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>"
