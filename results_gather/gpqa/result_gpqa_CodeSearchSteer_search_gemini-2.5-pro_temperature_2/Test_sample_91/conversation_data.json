    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can use the principles of thermochemistry, specifically relating bond energies to the enthalpy of formation.\n\nThe overall process can be broken down into two main steps based on Hess's Law:\n1.  The formation of gaseous atoms from the constituent elements in their standard state.\n2.  The formation of the compound from these gaseous atoms, which involves the release of energy equivalent to the sum of the bond energies.\n\nThe formula for the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is:\nΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the compound)\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count\n\nFirst, we need to determine the molecular formula and the number of each type of bond in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 carbons\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogens\n    *   Molecular Formula: **C12H22**\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** The structure contains two double bonds (`=`), so there are 2 C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** In a molecule with 12 carbon atoms and 2 double bonds, the number of single bonds between carbon atoms is 9. This can be verified by analyzing the structure piece by piece. Thus, there are 9 C-C bonds.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard states (C as solid graphite, H as H2 gas) to individual gaseous atoms.\n\n*   **For Carbon:** We need to form 12 moles of gaseous carbon atoms.\n    *   Energy = 12 mol × (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n\n*   **For Hydrogen:** We need to form 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen atoms from 11 moles of H2 gas. The bond energy of H-H (100 kJ/mol) is the energy to break one mole of H2 into two moles of H atoms.\n    *   Energy = 22 mol × (Enthalpy of atomization of H) = 11 mol × (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound\n\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms combine to form one mole of the compound. It is calculated by summing the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\n*   **Total Bond Energy:** 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound\n\nNow, we can find the enthalpy of formation of the compound.\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization) - (Total bond energy)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 5: Convert to the Units in the Options\n\nThe options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Option B is 11200 kJ/mol, which corresponds to the total bond energy, not the enthalpy of formation. Option D is 1900 kJ/g, which differs from our result by the unit. Let's convert our result to kJ/g and check against option C.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   M = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n\n*   **Enthalpy of Formation per gram:**\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
