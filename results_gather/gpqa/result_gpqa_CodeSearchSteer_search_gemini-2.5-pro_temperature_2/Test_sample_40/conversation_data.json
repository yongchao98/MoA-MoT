    "To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to a stationary observer in the laboratory, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula. This is a consequence of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the frames of reference:**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary frame (S).\n    *   The moving piece of glass is the moving frame (S').\n\n2.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S).\n    *   `u'`: The velocity of the light beam relative to the moving glass (frame S').\n    *   `u`: The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (frame S), which is what we need to find.\n\n3.  **Determine the speed of light in the glass (frame S'):**\n    *   The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by the formula `u' = c/n`.\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, is equal to 1.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of light within the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass, is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n4.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    *   The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is: `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / cÂ²)`.\n    *   Substituting `c=1` into the formula, we get: `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute the value of u' and solve:**\n    *   Now, we substitute `u' = 1/n` into the simplified formula:\n        `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) * v)`\n    *   To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n        `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to the formula first derived in relation to the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water and was an important early confirmation of relativity.\n\nBased on this derivation, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
