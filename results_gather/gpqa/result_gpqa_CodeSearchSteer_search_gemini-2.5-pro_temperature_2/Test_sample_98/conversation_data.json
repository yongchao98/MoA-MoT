    "To identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the provided spectral data from Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and match it to one of the four possible structures.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum**: The spectrum displays a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, which is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. Additionally, a strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which is consistent with all four given options.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum**: The 1H NMR data provides the key details needed to distinguish between the isomers.\n    *   **No Vinyl-Hydrogens**: This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C), which is consistent with the saturated structures of all four candidate molecules.\n    *   **Complex Splitting Patterns**: The observation of highly complex signals reveals specific neighbor relationships between protons in the molecule. Complex splitting occurs when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: A proton responsible for this signal must be adjacent to three different groups of protons: one group containing a single proton (which splits the signal into a **d**oublet), one group of two protons (which splits the signal into a **t**riplet), and one group of three protons (which splits the signal into a **q**uartet). The overall pattern is a combination of these individual splittings.\n        *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: A proton causing this signal must be coupled to three different proton environments: a single proton (giving a **d**oublet), a group of two protons (giving a **t**riplet), and another, different group of two protons (giving another **t**riplet).\n\n### **Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's examine the proton environments for the methine (CH) protons in each proposed structure to see if they match the observed splitting patterns.\n\n*   **Structure A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n\n    Let's analyze the two chiral methine protons, designated here as H-alpha and H-beta:\n    `CH₃-CH(alpha)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(beta)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n\n    *   **Proton H-alpha**: This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single adjacent H-beta proton (→ doublet).\n        *   The two protons of the neighboring ethyl group's CH₂ (→ triplet).\n        *   The three protons of the neighboring methyl group CH₃ (→ quartet).\n        This combination of one, two, and three neighboring protons will result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, matching the first signal described.\n\n    *   **Proton H-beta**: This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single adjacent H-alpha proton (→ doublet).\n        *   The two protons of the neighboring ethyl group's CH₂ (→ triplet).\n        *   The two protons of the main chain's CH₂ group adjacent to the carboxyl group (→ triplet).\n        This combination of one, two, and two neighboring protons gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, perfectly matching the second signal.\n\n*   **Structure B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**: The methine proton alpha to the carboxyl group would not exhibit dtt splitting. It is coupled to one methine proton and two protons of an ethyl group, resulting in a doublet of triplets.\n\n*   **Structure C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**: This structure contains methyl groups instead of ethyl groups attached to the main chain. A proton here would be coupled to methine protons and methyl protons, which would not produce the observed dtq and dtt patterns. For instance, the methine proton furthest from the COOH group would be split by one methine proton and two different methyl groups.\n\n*   **Structure D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**: This structure also lacks the necessary arrangement of neighboring protons to generate both a dtq and a dtt. The methine proton alpha to the carboxyl group, for example, is coupled to one methine and one methyl group, leading to a doublet of quartets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe detailed splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, specifically a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\", are uniquely consistent with the proton environments found in structure A. Therefore, the unknown compound is identified as CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH.\n\n<<<A>>>"
