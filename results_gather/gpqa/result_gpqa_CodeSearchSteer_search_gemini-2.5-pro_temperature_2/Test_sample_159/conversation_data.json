    "The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima of a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern produced by a specific aperture.\n\nFirst, let's identify the shape of the aperture. It is an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. As the number of sides, N, tends to infinity, a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a'. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe far-field diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima of the intensity pattern.\n\nThe angular positions of these minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for a minimum to occur at an angle θ is given by:\n`sin(θ) = (x / (2 * π * a)) * λ`\nwhere:\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `x` is a zero of the J₁(x) Bessel function.\n\nFor small angles, we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. Thus, the angular position of a minimum is:\n`θ ≈ (x / (2 * π * a)) * λ`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n*   The first zero, x₁, is approximately 3.8317.\n*   The second zero, x₂, is approximately 7.0156.\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):**\n    `θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):**\n    `θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between these two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`:\n`Δθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This corresponds to the position of the first minimum, not the distance between minima).\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5068 * (λ / a)` is in excellent agreement with option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
