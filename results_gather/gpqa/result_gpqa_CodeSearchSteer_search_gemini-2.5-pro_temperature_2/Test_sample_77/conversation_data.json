    "The correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion. They are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic signals propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe calculation must use the \"retarded time,\" `tr`, which is the time at which the field must have been generated by the charge to reach the observer at position `\\vec{r}` at time `t`. The key is that the distance the signal travels, `d`, is equal to `c(t-tr)`.\n\nThe derivation of the potentials from the retarded potential integrals results in a denominator that accounts for the motion of the source while it is emitting the signal.\n\nThe standard forms of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n\nScalar Potential (V):\n`V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}`\n\nThis can be rearranged by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`.\n\nVector Potential (`\\vec{A}`):\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}`\n\nSimilarly, this can be rearranged by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`.\n\nThese expressions can also be related by `\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V`.\n\nComparing these standard formulas with the given options:\n\n*   **A) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`**: This option correctly matches the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **B) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`**: The scalar potential is the static form and does not account for retardation effects due to motion.\n*   **C) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`**: The sign in the denominator is incorrect. A positive sign corresponds to the non-physical \"advanced\" potentials, which would violate causality.\n*   **D) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`**: The scalar potential is the incorrect static form, and the relationship for the vector potential is dimensionally and vectorially incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving charge.\n\n<<<A>>>"
