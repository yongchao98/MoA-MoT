    "Here is a breakdown of the analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided spectral data.\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula to calculate DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). Primary amines exhibit two bands (asymmetric and symmetric stretching), while secondary amines show only one, and tertiary amines show none.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** A strong absorption here points to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For aromatic esters, this peak typically appears between 1715 and 1730 cm⁻¹. The position is consistent with an ester group conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The chemical shift is significantly downfield, indicating this methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen. This triplet-quartet combination is the classic signature of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen (`-O-CH2CH3`).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons on a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). These protons are exchangeable, which often results in a broad signal without clear splitting.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, are highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at the higher field (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to a strong electron-donating group (the -NH2). The doublet at the lower field (8.0 ppm) is next to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl, -COOEt).\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the evidence:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together results in the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### 5. Verifying the Structure and Evaluating Alternatives\n\n*   **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as Benzocaine):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2. (Matches)\n    *   **IR Data:** Contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester (C=O). (Matches)\n    *   **¹H NMR Data:** Contains an ethyl group, a para-substituted aromatic ring, and a primary amine group. Published spectra for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate show a triplet around 1.35 ppm, a quartet at 4.31 ppm, a broad singlet for the amine around 4.16 ppm, and two doublets for the aromatic protons at approximately 6.62 and 7.84 ppm. These values are in excellent agreement with the provided data.\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ester is `Ar-O-C(=O)R`. The protons on the `-CH2-` of the propionate group would appear much further upfield (around 2.3-2.6 ppm).\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has an amide (-CONH2) instead of an ester and is *meta*-substituted, which would produce a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (`-NHCHO`). The IR spectrum would show only one N-H band, not two. Also, it would have a very characteristic formyl proton signal (`-CHO`) at ~8-8.5 ppm with an integration of 1H, which is absent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided data unequivocally points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
