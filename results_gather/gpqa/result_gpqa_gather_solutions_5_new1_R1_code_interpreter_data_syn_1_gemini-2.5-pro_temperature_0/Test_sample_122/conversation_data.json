Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)\n\nA) 3 060 000 km.\nB) 3 000 000 km.\nC) 2 940 000 km.\nD) 2 880 000 km.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n*   The time interval measured in the ejecta's frame (the proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n\n**3. Apply the Concept of Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object as observed from a stationary frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n\n*   The time `Δt'` (50 s) is the proper time because it's measured by a clock moving with the ejecta.\n*   We need to find the corresponding time interval `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n*   The formula for time dilation is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\n*   The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n*   Next, square this ratio:\n    `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n*   Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n**5. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n\n*   Using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, about 51.03 seconds pass in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**\n\n*   The distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame is the ejecta's velocity (in that frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in that frame).\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n*   `Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n**A More Precise Calculation**\n\nWe can combine the steps to avoid rounding errors:\n`Distance = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   Calculate the non-relativistic distance first: `v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n*   Now, divide by `sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`:\n    `Distance = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `Distance ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if we ignored relativity)\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nOur calculated distance of approximately 3,062,000 km is extremely close to option D. The small difference is due to rounding in the provided option.\n\n**Conceptual Check:**\nDue to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) must be longer than the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`). Therefore, the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (`v * Δt`) must be greater than the non-relativistic distance (`v * Δt' = 3,000,000 km`). Only option D is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires the application of the principle of time dilation from Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information\n\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame:** This is the \"stationary\" frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame:** This is the \"moving\" frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of 60,000 km/s. So, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time that has passed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is 50 seconds. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To find this distance, we need to know two things from the Galaxy's perspective: the ejecta's velocity (`v`) and the time elapsed (`Δt`).\n\nDistance in Galaxy Frame = `v * Δt`\n\n### 3. Calculate Time Dilation\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect is called time dilation. The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nwhere the Lorentz factor `γ` is:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lorentz factor:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\nNow, we can find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`):\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\nThis means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.03 seconds.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Distance\n\nFinally, we can calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame using the time we just calculated (`Δt`) and the given velocity (`v`).\n\nDistance = `v * Δt`\nDistance = `60,000 km/s * (50 s / √0.96)`\nDistance = `3,000,000 km / √0.96`\nDistance ≈ `3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\nDistance ≈ `3,061,862 km`\n\nThis calculated distance is closest to the value in option A.\n\n*   **Classical Calculation (Ignoring Relativity):** If we were to ignore relativistic effects, the distance would simply be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C).\n*   **Relativistic Calculation:** The correct calculation, accounting for time dilation, yields approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy's frame (which we can consider stationary) and the ejecta's frame (which is moving).\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity `v` between the frames is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `t0 = 50` s. This is the \"proper time\".\n    *   The speed of light `c` is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n3.  **Apply the time dilation formula:** A clock in a moving frame appears to run slower when observed from a stationary frame. The time `t` measured in the Galaxy's frame is related to the proper time `t0` by the formula:\n    `t = t0 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  **Calculate the distance:** The distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity `v` multiplied by the time `t` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `distance = v * t`\n5.  **Combine and compute:** We will substitute the time dilation formula into the distance formula and calculate the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Information ---\n# Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (v) in km/s\nv = 60000\n\n# Time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time, t0) in seconds\nt0 = 50\n\n# Speed of light (c) in km/s\nc = 300000\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Step 1: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (t)\n# According to the theory of special relativity, time in the stationary frame (Galaxy)\n# is dilated relative to the moving frame (ejecta).\n# The formula for time dilation is: t = t0 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\n# Calculate the ratio v/c squared\nv_over_c_squared = (v / c)**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the Lorentz factor\ndenominator = math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time 't' in the Galaxy's frame\nt_galaxy = t0 / denominator\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\n# The distance is the velocity (v) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (t_galaxy).\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = v * t_galaxy\n\n# --- Output the result ---\nprint(f\"The calculated time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is: {t_galaxy:.4f} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is: {distance_in_galaxy_frame:.0f} km.\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 3 000 000 km\")\nprint(\"B) 3 060 000 km\")\nprint(\"C) 2 880 000 km\")\nprint(\"D) 2 940 000 km\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated distance is closest to option B.\")\n\n# --- Final Answer ---\n# The calculated value is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n# Comparing this to the options, 3,060,000 km is the closest choice.\nfinal_choice = \"B\"\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: {final_choice}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is: 51.0310 seconds.\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is: 3061862 km.\n\nHere are the options:\nA) 3 000 000 km\nB) 3 060 000 km\nC) 2 880 000 km\nD) 2 940 000 km\n\nThe calculated distance is closest to option B.\n\nFinal Answer Choice: B\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the frames of reference and given information.**\n*   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame.\n*   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame.\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame is given as 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in the moving frame (S'). So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the goal.**\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy reference frame (S)**. Let's call this distance `d`. To find this distance, we need to use the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the principle of Time Dilation.**\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes a proper time (`Δt₀`) in a moving frame (the ejecta). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The relationship is given by the formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 6/30 = 1/5 = 0.2`\n\nNow, square this value:\n`(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\nSubstitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\nUsing the time dilation formula from Step 3:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n`Δt = 50 / sqrt(0.96) s`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n`Δt ≈ 50 / 0.9798 ≈ 51.03 s`\nSo, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d).**\nNow we use the distance formula with the time `Δt` calculated for the Galaxy's frame:\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n`d ≈ 3,061,849 km`\n\n**Step 7: Compare the result with the given options.**\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nOur calculated value of `3,061,849 km` is extremely close to option D.\n\n---\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Identifying Proper Time:** The most crucial step is correctly identifying which time interval is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`). Proper time is always the time measured in the reference frame where the event's start and end points occur at the same location (i.e., the clock is at rest relative to the event). Here, the 50 seconds is measured by a clock on the ejecta, so it is the proper time.\n2.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** One could be tempted to use length contraction. If you calculate the distance in the ejecta's frame (`d' = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km`), this is a *contracted length*. The distance in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is the *proper length*. The relationship is `d' = d / γ`, which leads to `d = d' * γ = 3,000,000 * γ`, giving the same result. It's essential not to mix up the formulas.\n3.  **Non-Relativistic Error:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and simply calculate `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option C and is incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%).\n4.  **Incorrect Application of γ:** Another potential error is to multiply by `sqrt(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing. This would give `d = 3,000,000 * sqrt(0.96) ≈ 2,939,388 km`, which is close to option A. This would imply time \"contraction\" instead of dilation, which is incorrect. The time measured in the stationary frame is always longer.\n5.  **Units:** Ensure all units are consistent. Here, using `km/s` for velocity and `s` for time is fine, as the final answer is requested in `km`.\n\nBy correctly applying the principle of time dilation, we find that the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame is longer than 50 seconds, and therefore the distance traveled is greater than the non-relativistic calculation of 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Ejecta's Frame:** This is the moving frame of reference. The time measured in this frame is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because, for an observer on the ejecta, the clock is at rest. We are given `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Galaxy's Frame:** This is considered the stationary frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Physical Principle**\nThis problem involves Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Specifically, it deals with the concept of **time dilation**. An observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will observe that time passes more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). Therefore, the 50 seconds that pass on the ejecta's clock will correspond to a longer time interval in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**3. List the Given Values**\n*   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   Speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**4. The Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    The Lorentz factor quantifies the effect of time dilation. It is calculated using the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n    The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d)**\n    The distance traveled is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the same reference frame. We use the time `Δt` that we just calculated for the Galaxy's frame.\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    Using a calculator, `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`.\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5.

The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is the proper time, Δt₀. The time measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's clock) is Δt. The relationship is Δt = γ * Δt₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Understand the Problem and Identify the Physics**\n\nThe problem describes a scenario where an object (supernova ejecta) is moving at a very high speed relative to an observer (in the Galaxy's reference frame). The speed, 60,000 km/s, is 20% of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s). When speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, the effects of Special Relativity become important. The key concept here is **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Define the Reference Frames**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time given, 50 seconds, is measured in this frame. This is known as the **proper time** (`Δt'`) because it's the time measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame.\n\n**3. State the Goal**\n\nWe need to find the distance (`Δx`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`.\n`Δx = v * Δt`\nHere, `v` is the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, and `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**4. Apply the Time Dilation Formula**\n\nWe are given the time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt' = 50 s`), but we need the time in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). According to the principle of time dilation, a moving clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame. The relationship is:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5.

Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Identify the knowns:**\n*   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The time that has passed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Determine the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary reference frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nwhere:\n*   `Δt` is the time measured in the stationary reference frame (the Galaxy).\n*   `Δt₀` is the proper time, measured in the moving reference frame (the ejecta).\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light:\n\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n**4. Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n\nNow, we can use the time dilation formula with the calculated Lorentz factor:\n\n`Δt = 1.0206 * 50 s = 51.03 s`\n\nSo, while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame would measure 51.03 seconds.\n\n**5. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n\nFinally, to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame, we use the standard distance formula:\n\n`Distance = Velocity * Time`\n`d = v * Δt`\n\n`d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 3,061,800 km`\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\nLet's re-calculate with higher precision to be certain.\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n`Δt = 50 / sqrt(0.96)`\n`d = 60000 * (50 / sqrt(0.96))`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThis result is very close to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n\n*   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. It is moving at a high velocity relative to the Galaxy frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is the relative velocity between the two frames.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is called the proper time because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physics Principle**\n\nThis is a problem in special relativity. Because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must account for the effects of time dilation. Time dilation means that time passes at different rates for observers in different inertial frames of reference. A clock moving relative to an observer will be measured to tick slower than a clock that is stationary relative to the observer.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nWhere:\n*   `Δt` is the time elapsed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy).\n*   `Δt'` is the proper time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor depends on the relative velocity `v` and the speed of light `c`.\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = (60,000 km/s) / (300,000 km/s) = 0.2`\n\nNow, square this value:\n`(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\nNow, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n**4. Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n\nUsing the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n`Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n`Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\nSo, while 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n**5. Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**\n\nThe distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity (in that frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in that frame).\n`Distance = v * Δt`\n\nUsing the precise form for `Δt` for better accuracy:\n`Distance = v * (γ * Δt')`\n`Distance = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n`Distance = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`Distance = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`Distance ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n`Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n*   D) 2,940,000 km (This results from incorrectly multiplying by the `sqrt(1-v²/c²)` factor instead of dividing)\n\nOur calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option A. The small difference is due to rounding in the options.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe search results confirm my understanding of time dilation.\n\n*   **Time Dilation Formula**: The formula for time dilation is given as `t = t0 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `t` is the time observed in the stationary reference frame and `t0` is the time in the moving observer's own frame of reference (rest time). This matches my formula `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n*   **Stationary vs. Moving Frame**: The \"clock\" in motion slows down as observed by a stationary observer. In this problem, the ejecta is the moving frame, and the Galaxy is the stationary frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in the ejecta's frame, so it is the proper time (`t0` or `Δt₀`).\n*   **Calculation Process**: The problem asks for the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame. This requires calculating the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame (`t` or `Δt`), which will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. The distance is then this dilated time multiplied by the velocity.\n\nMy calculation steps are therefore correct.\n1.  **Given**:\n    *   Velocity (`v`) = 60,000 km/s\n    *   Proper time (`Δt₀`) = 50 s (time in the moving frame of the ejecta)\n    *   Speed of light (`c`) = 300,000 km/s\n2.  **Calculate `β = v/c`**:\n    *   `β = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n3.  **Calculate Lorentz factor `γ`**:\n    *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n4.  **Calculate dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy frame**:\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n5.  **Calculate distance `d` in the Galaxy frame**:\n    *   `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option A. The difference of ~1,862 km (or ~0.06%) is due to the rounding of the value in the provided option.\n\nI have confirmed the physics principles and the mathematical steps. The conclusion is robust.\n\nFinal check on the logic:\n- The question asks for a distance in the Galaxy frame.\n- `Distance = velocity × time`.\n- The velocity and time must be measured in the same frame (the Galaxy frame).\n- Velocity in Galaxy frame is given: 60,000 km/s.\n- Time in ejecta frame is given: 50 s.\n- To find the time in the Galaxy frame, we must use the time dilation formula, as clocks in the moving ejecta frame run slow compared to clocks in the Galaxy frame.\n- The time in the Galaxy frame will be longer than 50 s (`Δt = γ * 50s`, and `γ` is > 1).\n- Therefore the distance will be greater than the non-relativistic distance of `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This rules out options B, C, and D. Option A is the only one greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\nThis confirms the answer without even needing the exact calculation, just the understanding of the direction of the time dilation effect.\n\nThe calculation `d ≈ 3,061,862 km` confirms that A (`3,060,000 km`) is the intended answer.The problem involves the special theory of relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame of reference is the Galaxy.\n    *   The \"moving\" frame of reference is the supernova ejecta.\n\n2.  **Identify the given variables.**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (`v`) is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (`Δt₀`, also known as proper time) is 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light (`c`) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal.**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To calculate this, we need to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`).\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula.**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. The formula for time dilation is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n        where `Δt` is the time in the stationary frame, `Δt₀` is the time in the moving frame, and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (`β = v/c`):\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds have passed for an observer on the ejecta, about 51.031 seconds have passed for an observer in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n    *   The distance (`d`) is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time (`Δt`), both measured in the same (Galaxy) frame.\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   The calculated distance of approximately 3,061,860 km is very close to option A. The small difference is due to rounding in the intermediate steps.\n\nAlternatively, without an intermediate calculation, the distance is:\n`d = v * γ * Δt₀ = 60,000 * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km.` This value is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\nA conceptual check also points to option A: due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy frame is longer than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled must be greater than the non-relativistic calculation of `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. Option A is the only choice that is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference**: We have two frames of reference: the supernova ejecta's frame (the moving frame) and the Galaxy's frame (the stationary frame).\n2.  **Identify the Given Information**:\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time), `t_proper = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `299,792.458 km/s`.\n3.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation**: According to the theory of special relativity, time passes differently for observers in different frames of reference that are moving relative to each other.

This is known as the *proper time*.\n    *   Due to *time dilation*, an observer in the Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval `Δt` for the same event.\n    *   The relationship between the time `Δt` in the stationary frame and the proper time `Δt'` in the moving frame is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   We already found `β = v/c = 0.2`.\n    *   `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`.\n    *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n    *   Calculating the value: `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`.\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n    *   `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`.\n    *   `Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`.\n    *   This shows that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy measures about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   The distance is the velocity (measured in the Galaxy frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (also measured in the Galaxy frame).\n    *   `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `v` and `Δt`:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s) * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n    *   Our calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option D.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The key is to correctly identify that the given time of 50 seconds is the *proper time* (`Δt'`) because it is measured in the reference frame of the moving object (the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** One must apply the correct formula. Using `Δt = Δt' / γ` would be incorrect and would lead to option B.\n*   **Classical vs. Relativistic:** A purely classical calculation (`d = v * Δt' = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km`) ignores time dilation and leads to option C. The relativistic answer must be greater than the classical one in this case because the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame is longer than `Δt'`.\n*   **Consistency of Frames:** The distance in the Galaxy's frame must be calculated using the velocity and time as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n*   **Alternative Method (Length Contraction):** From the ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy travels is `d' = v * Δt' = 3,000,000 km`. This `d'` is a contracted length of the actual path `d` in the Galaxy's frame. The formula is `d' = d / γ`, so the proper path length is `d = d' * γ = 3,000,000 * γ = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`, which confirms the result.\n\nFinal calculation is `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862` km.

Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information\n\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame (Moving Frame):** This is the frame of reference of the supernova ejecta. The time that passes in this frame is the proper time, `Δt₀`.\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (Stationary Frame):** This is the frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.

Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To find this distance (`d`), we need to multiply the ejecta's velocity (`v`) by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`).\n\n`d = v * Δt`\n\n### 3.

Identify the Given Information:\n*   **Velocity (v):** The ejecta and the center of the Galaxy are moving towards each other at 60,000 km/s. This is the relative velocity between the two inertial frames of reference.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** 50 seconds is the time measured in the ejecta's own reference frame. Time measured in a moving frame of reference is known as proper time.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** For calculations, the speed of light is approximated as 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. The Goal:\nThe question asks for the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To find this distance, we need to know the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) and multiply it by the velocity (v).\n\n### 3. Time Dilation:\nAccording to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for events occurring in a moving frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nwhere:\n*   Δt is the time observed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy).\n*   Δt₀ is the proper time observed in the moving frame (the ejecta), which is 50 s.\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 4. Calculation Steps:\n\n**a. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, find the ratio of the velocity to the speed of light:\nv/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, square this value:\n(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n\nSubstitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n\n**b. Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\nUsing the time dilation formula:\nΔt = Δt₀ / √0.96 = 50 s / √0.96\n\n**c. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\nThe distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the Galaxy's frame:\nd = v * Δt\nd = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √0.96)\nd = 3,000,000 km / √0.96\n\nNow, we calculate the final value:\n√0.96 ≈ 0.9798\nd ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798\nd ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nThis calculated distance is closest to the multiple-choice option B. The non-relativistic calculation (60,000 km/s * 50 s) would yield 3,000,000 km (Option A), but time dilation means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer, resulting in a greater distance traveled.\n\nTherefore, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThis problem is a classic example of special relativity, specifically involving the concept of time dilation.

We want to find the distance traveled as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame:** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame, making it the *proper time*.\n\n**2. Understand Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving object (as measured by a stationary observer) passes more slowly than for the stationary observer. This effect, called time dilation, is significant at speeds approaching the speed of light. The time interval measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will be longer than the time interval measured in the moving frame (ejecta).\n\n**3.

Use the standard distance formula with the dilated time calculated in the previous step.\n    Distance = velocity × time\n    Distance = v * Δt\n    Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s\n    Distance ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\n**4.

Let's try an approximation that often works for these problems. For small `x`, `(1-x)^(-1/2) ≈ 1 + (1/2)x`.\nHere, `x = 0.04`.\n`γ ≈ 1 + (1/2) * 0.04 = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02`\n\n**Step D: Calculate the time in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\nUsing the approximate Lorentz factor:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s`\n\n**Careful Point:** Note that the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (51 s) is longer than the time measured on the ejecta's clock (50 s). This is the essence of time dilation.\n\n**Step E: Calculate the final distance (Δx).**\nNow substitute the values of `v` and `Δt` into the distance formula from Step A:\n`Δx = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51 s`\n`Δx ≈ 3,060,000 km`\n\n**4.

The time measured in this frame is the \"proper time\" (Δt₀), as it is the frame where the clock (the ejecta) is at rest.\n    *   Proper time (Δt₀) = 50 s\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (S):** This is considered the stationary frame of reference.

Understand Time Dilation\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect is called time dilation. The time that passes in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) will be longer than the 50 seconds that pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### 3.

Let's call them:\n        *   **S (Galaxy Frame):** This is the \"stationary\" reference frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n        *   **S' (Ejecta Frame):** This is the \"moving\" reference frame.\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is given. The Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at v = 60,000 km/s. By the principle of relativity, the ejecta is also moving at this speed relative to the Galaxy.\n        *   **v = 60,000 km/s**\n    *   The time interval is measured in the ejecta's reference frame (S').\n        *   **Δt' = 50 s**\n    *   The question asks for the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n        *   **Goal: Find d**\n\n2.  **Recognize the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The speed of the ejecta (60,000 km/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s). Therefore, we must use the principles of Special Relativity.\n    *   The key principle here is **Time Dilation**. A clock moving relative to an observer appears to tick slower than a stationary clock. The time measured in the moving frame (S') is the *proper time* (Δt₀ or Δt'), while the time measured by the stationary observer (in frame S) is the *dilated time* (Δt).\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   To find the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy frame (S), we need to use the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy frame (S).\n    *   We are given the time elapsed in the ejecta frame (S'), which is the proper time `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   We need to use the time dilation formula to find `Δt` from `Δt'`.\n    *   The time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   First, we must calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n\n### Execution of the Plan\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n\n*   The Lorentz factor is defined as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   First, find the ratio `β = v/c`:\n    *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    *   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`\n    *   `β = 60,000 / 300,000 = 6/30 = 1/5 = 0.2`\n*   Now, calculate `γ`:\n    *   `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt)**\n\n*   Use the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n*   We know `Δt' = 50 s` and `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n*   `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d)**\n\n*   Use the formula `d = v * Δt`.\n*   Substitute the expressions for `v` and `Δt`:\n    *   `d = (60,000 km/s) * [ (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s ]`\n*   Rearrange the terms for easier calculation:\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n*   Now, calculate the final value:\n    *   `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.979796`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979796 km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,961 km`\n\n**Step D: Compare the result with the given options**\n\n*   Our calculated distance is approximately 3,061,961 km.\n*   The options are:\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the result if relativistic effects were ignored).\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n*   The calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is due to rounding. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Proper Time:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame is the *proper time* (Δt'), because the clock measuring the time is at rest in that frame.\n2.  **Time Dilation Direction:** Remember that the time measured by the stationary observer (Δt) is always *longer* than the proper time (Δt'), because moving clocks run slow. This means `Δt = γ * Δt'`, and since `γ ≥ 1`, `Δt ≥ Δt'`.\n3.  **Frame Consistency:** When calculating the distance in the Galaxy frame (`d = v * Δt`), you must use the time measured in that same frame (`Δt`), not the time from the moving frame (`Δt'`).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThe problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation.

Time Dilation\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame of reference will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect, known as time dilation, means that the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`t`) will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`t = γ * t₀`\n\nwhere `t` is the time in the stationary observer's frame (the Galaxy), `t₀` is the proper time in the moving frame (the ejecta), and `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 3.

Calculate Time in the Galaxy's Frame (t)\nNow, use the time dilation formula:\n`t = γ * t₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\nSo, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, about 51.03 seconds pass in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### 5.

For many calculations, this is rounded to 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. Understand the Physics\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving object passes slower than for a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. To find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame, we first need to determine how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n### 3. The Formulas\nThe relationship between time in the stationary frame (Δt) and the proper time in the moving frame (Δt₀) is given by the time dilation formula:\n**Δt = γ * Δt₀**\n\nWhere **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n**γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)**\n\nOnce we find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt), the distance (d) traveled is calculated using the standard distance formula:\n**d = v * Δt**\n\n### 4. Calculation Steps\nLet's perform the calculation using the precise value for the speed of light (c = 299,792.458 km/s).\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n    *   v = 60,000 km/s\n    *   c = 299,792.458 km/s\n    *   (v/c)² = (60,000 / 299,792.458)² ≈ 0.0400554\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.0400554)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(0.9599446)\n    *   γ ≈ 1.02065\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame**\n    *   Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    *   Δt ≈ 1.02065 * 50 s\n    *   Δt ≈ 51.0325 s\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame**\n    *   d = v * Δt\n    *   d = 60,000 km/s * 51.0325 s\n    *   d ≈ 3,061,950 km\n\nThis result is extremely close to the value in option B. The minor discrepancy often arises because problems of this nature in textbooks or exams are designed with a rounded speed of light or a simplified Lorentz factor for easier calculation. For example, if we assume the time elapsed in the galaxy frame is exactly 51 seconds:\n*   d = 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km.\n\nThis matches option B exactly.

Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem involves a very high velocity (60,000 km/s) which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s). This tells us that we cannot use classical mechanics (`distance = velocity × time`) directly. We must apply the principles of Einstein's Special Relativity.\n*   **Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference:\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame: The Galaxy.

Let's call this frame S'.\n*   **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Relative velocity between frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock), `Δt' = 50 s`. In relativity, the time measured in an object's own moving frame is called the **proper time**, denoted as `Δt₀`. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Determine the Goal:** We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n*   **Apply the Correct Relativistic Principle:** The key concept is **time dilation**. An observer in the stationary frame (S) will see time passing more slowly for the moving frame (S'). Therefore, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time (`Δt₀`).\n*   **Formulate the Equations:**\n    1.  The time dilation formula relates the two time intervals: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    2.  The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    3.  The distance in the Galaxy frame is calculated using the time measured in the Galaxy frame: `d = v * Δt`\n*   **Plan the Calculation:**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n    2.  Use `γ` to find the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.\n    3.  Use `Δt` to calculate the distance `d`.\n\n**2.

The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**4. Apply the Time Dilation Formula**\nBecause the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v/c = 60,000/300,000 = 0.2`), the time measured in the stationary Galaxy frame (`Δt`) will be different from the time measured in the moving ejecta's frame (`Δt'`).

At such a significant velocity, we must account for relativistic effects.

This means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame will be longer than 50 seconds.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   We can find `Δt` using the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these formulas, we get: `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Classical Distance (for comparison):** First, let's calculate the distance ignoring relativity: `d_classical = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option B.\n    *   **Logical Check:** Due to time dilation, `Δt` must be greater than `Δt₀`. Therefore, the actual distance `d` must be greater than `3,000,000 km`. This immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A as a possibility.\n    *   **Full Relativistic Calculation:**\n        *   Calculate the Lorentz factor, γ:\n            `γ = 1 / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n            `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n        *   Calculate the distance `d`:\n            `d = d_classical * γ ≈ 3,000,000 km * 1.02062 ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,860 km`. This is extremely close to `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is due to rounding in the problem's option. The logical check also confirms that the answer must be greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Understand the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n*   The time interval measured in the ejecta's frame (the proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n\n**3. Apply the Concept of Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object as observed from a stationary frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n\n*   The time `Δt'` (50 s) is the proper time because it's measured by a clock moving with the ejecta.\n*   We need to find the corresponding time interval `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n*   The formula for time dilation is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\n*   The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n*   Next, square this ratio:\n    `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n*   Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n**5. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n\n*   Using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, about 51.03 seconds pass in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**\n\n*   The distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame is the ejecta's velocity (in that frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in that frame).\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n*   `Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n**A More Precise Calculation**\n\nWe can combine the steps to avoid rounding errors:\n`Distance = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n*   Calculate the non-relativistic distance first: `v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n*   Now, divide by `sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`:\n    `Distance = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `Distance ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if we ignored relativity)\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nOur calculated distance of approximately 3,062,000 km is extremely close to option D. The small difference is due to rounding in the provided option.\n\n**Conceptual Check:**\nDue to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) must be longer than the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`). Therefore, the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (`v * Δt`) must be greater than the non-relativistic distance (`v * Δt' = 3,000,000 km`). Only option D is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires the application of the principle of time dilation from Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information\n\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame:** This is the \"stationary\" frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame:** This is the \"moving\" frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of 60,000 km/s. So, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time that has passed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is 50 seconds. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To find this distance, we need to know two things from the Galaxy's perspective: the ejecta's velocity (`v`) and the time elapsed (`Δt`).\n\nDistance in Galaxy Frame = `v * Δt`\n\n### 3. Calculate Time Dilation\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect is called time dilation. The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nwhere the Lorentz factor `γ` is:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lorentz factor:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\nNow, we can find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`):\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\nThis means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.03 seconds.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Distance\n\nFinally, we can calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame using the time we just calculated (`Δt`) and the given velocity (`v`).\n\nDistance = `v * Δt`\nDistance = `60,000 km/s * (50 s / √0.96)`\nDistance = `3,000,000 km / √0.96`\nDistance ≈ `3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\nDistance ≈ `3,061,862 km`\n\nThis calculated distance is closest to the value in option A.\n\n*   **Classical Calculation (Ignoring Relativity):** If we were to ignore relativistic effects, the distance would simply be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C).\n*   **Relativistic Calculation:** The correct calculation, accounting for time dilation, yields approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy's frame (which we can consider stationary) and the ejecta's frame (which is moving).\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity `v` between the frames is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `t0 = 50` s. This is the \"proper time\".\n    *   The speed of light `c` is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n3.  **Apply the time dilation formula:** A clock in a moving frame appears to run slower when observed from a stationary frame. The time `t` measured in the Galaxy's frame is related to the proper time `t0` by the formula:\n    `t = t0 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  **Calculate the distance:** The distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity `v` multiplied by the time `t` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `distance = v * t`\n5.  **Combine and compute:** We will substitute the time dilation formula into the distance formula and calculate the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Information ---\n# Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (v) in km/s\nv = 60000\n\n# Time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time, t0) in seconds\nt0 = 50\n\n# Speed of light (c) in km/s\nc = 300000\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Step 1: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (t)\n# According to the theory of special relativity, time in the stationary frame (Galaxy)\n# is dilated relative to the moving frame (ejecta).\n# The formula for time dilation is: t = t0 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\n# Calculate the ratio v/c squared\nv_over_c_squared = (v / c)**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the Lorentz factor\ndenominator = math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time 't' in the Galaxy's frame\nt_galaxy = t0 / denominator\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\n# The distance is the velocity (v) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (t_galaxy).\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = v * t_galaxy\n\n# --- Output the result ---\nprint(f\"The calculated time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is: {t_galaxy:.4f} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is: {distance_in_galaxy_frame:.0f} km.\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 3 000 000 km\")\nprint(\"B) 3 060 000 km\")\nprint(\"C) 2 880 000 km\")\nprint(\"D) 2 940 000 km\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated distance is closest to option B.\")\n\n# --- Final Answer ---\n# The calculated value is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n# Comparing this to the options, 3,060,000 km is the closest choice.\nfinal_choice = \"B\"\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: {final_choice}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is: 51.0310 seconds.\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is: 3061862 km.\n\nHere are the options:\nA) 3 000 000 km\nB) 3 060 000 km\nC) 2 880 000 km\nD) 2 940 000 km\n\nThe calculated distance is closest to option B.\n\nFinal Answer Choice: B\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the frames of reference and given information.**\n*   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame.\n*   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame.\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame is given as 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in the moving frame (S'). So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the goal.**\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy reference frame (S)**. Let's call this distance `d`. To find this distance, we need to use the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the principle of Time Dilation.**\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes a proper time (`Δt₀`) in a moving frame (the ejecta). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The relationship is given by the formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 6/30 = 1/5 = 0.2`\n\nNow, square this value:\n`(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\nSubstitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\nUsing the time dilation formula from Step 3:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n`Δt = 50 / sqrt(0.96) s`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n`Δt ≈ 50 / 0.9798 ≈ 51.03 s`\nSo, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d).**\nNow we use the distance formula with the time `Δt` calculated for the Galaxy's frame:\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n`d ≈ 3,061,849 km`\n\n**Step 7: Compare the result with the given options.**\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nOur calculated value of `3,061,849 km` is extremely close to option D.\n\n---\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Identifying Proper Time:** The most crucial step is correctly identifying which time interval is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`). Proper time is always the time measured in the reference frame where the event's start and end points occur at the same location (i.e., the clock is at rest relative to the event). Here, the 50 seconds is measured by a clock on the ejecta, so it is the proper time.\n2.  **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** One could be tempted to use length contraction. If you calculate the distance in the ejecta's frame (`d' = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km`), this is a *contracted length*. The distance in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is the *proper length*. The relationship is `d' = d / γ`, which leads to `d = d' * γ = 3,000,000 * γ`, giving the same result. It's essential not to mix up the formulas.\n3.  **Non-Relativistic Error:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and simply calculate `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option C and is incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%).\n4.  **Incorrect Application of γ:** Another potential error is to multiply by `sqrt(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing. This would give `d = 3,000,000 * sqrt(0.96) ≈ 2,939,388 km`, which is close to option A. This would imply time \"contraction\" instead of dilation, which is incorrect. The time measured in the stationary frame is always longer.\n5.  **Units:** Ensure all units are consistent. Here, using `km/s` for velocity and `s` for time is fine, as the final answer is requested in `km`.\n\nBy correctly applying the principle of time dilation, we find that the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame is longer than 50 seconds, and therefore the distance traveled is greater than the non-relativistic calculation of 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Ejecta's Frame:** This is the moving frame of reference. The time measured in this frame is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because, for an observer on the ejecta, the clock is at rest. We are given `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Galaxy's Frame:** This is considered the stationary frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Physical Principle**\nThis problem involves Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Specifically, it deals with the concept of **time dilation**. An observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will observe that time passes more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). Therefore, the 50 seconds that pass on the ejecta's clock will correspond to a longer time interval in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**3.

The formula for the Lorentz factor is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n3.  **The Question**: The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels *in the Galaxy reference frame*.\n4.  **Calculation**: This distance (`d`) is the ejecta's velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`).\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   Since `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, the formula becomes `d = v * γ * Δt₀`.\n\nLet's re-verify the calculation steps:\n\n*   **Given**:\n    *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    *   `Δt₀ = 50 s` (time in the ejecta's frame, which is the moving frame)\n    *   `c = 300,000 km/s` (approximate speed of light)\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n    *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   `γ = 1 / √(1 - (v/c)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n    *   `√0.96 ≈ 0.9797959`\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9797959 ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n    *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n*   **Alternative Calculation**:\n    *   `d = γ * (v * Δt₀)`\n    *   `d ≈ 1.02062 * (60,000 km/s * 50 s)`\n    *   `d ≈ 1.02062 * 3,000,000 km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,860 km.\n\n*   **Compare with options**:\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option B. The minor difference of 1,860 km (about 0.06%) is negligible and likely due to rounding in the problem's design.\n\nAs noted in the initial thought process, a simple logical check also points to B. The classical distance would be `v * Δt₀ = 3,000,000 km` (Option C). Due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) is longer than the time in the ejecta frame (`Δt₀`). Therefore, the distance measured in the Galaxy frame (`v * Δt`) must be greater than 3,000,000 km. Option B is the only choice that satisfies this condition.\n\nThe physics and the calculation are sound.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n- Distance in Galaxy frame = `d_G`\n- Velocity = `v`\n- Time in Galaxy frame = `t_G`\n- Time in ejecta frame = `t_E` = 50 s\n- `d_G = v * t_G`\n- `t_G = γ * t_E`\n- `d_G = v * γ * t_E`\n- `d_G = 60,000 * (1/sqrt(1-0.2^2)) * 50`\n- `d_G = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n- `d_G ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThe result is consistent.

Understand the Problem and Identify the Physics**\n\nThe problem describes a scenario where an object (supernova ejecta) is moving at a very high speed relative to an observer (in the Galaxy's reference frame). The speed, 60,000 km/s, is 20% of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s). When speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, the effects of Special Relativity become important. The key concept here is **time dilation**.\n\n**2.

The time given, 50 seconds, is measured in this frame. This is known as the **proper time** (`Δt'`) because it's the time measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame.\n\n**3. State the Goal**\n\nWe need to find the distance (`Δx`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`.\n`Δx = v * Δt`\nHere, `v` is the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, and `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**4. Apply the Time Dilation Formula**\n\nWe are given the time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt' = 50 s`), but we need the time in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). According to the principle of time dilation, a moving clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame. The relationship is:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5.

Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Identify the knowns:**\n*   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The time that has passed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Determine the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary reference frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nwhere:\n*   `Δt` is the time measured in the stationary reference frame (the Galaxy).\n*   `Δt₀` is the proper time, measured in the moving reference frame (the ejecta).\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light:\n\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n**4. Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n\nNow, we can use the time dilation formula with the calculated Lorentz factor:\n\n`Δt = 1.0206 * 50 s = 51.03 s`\n\nSo, while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame would measure 51.03 seconds.\n\n**5. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n\nFinally, to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame, we use the standard distance formula:\n\n`Distance = Velocity * Time`\n`d = v * Δt`\n\n`d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 3,061,800 km`\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\nLet's re-calculate with higher precision to be certain.\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n`Δt = 50 / sqrt(0.96)`\n`d = 60000 * (50 / sqrt(0.96))`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThis result is very close to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n\n*   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. It is moving at a high velocity relative to the Galaxy frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is the relative velocity between the two frames.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is called the proper time because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physics Principle**\n\nThis is a problem in special relativity. Because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must account for the effects of time dilation. Time dilation means that time passes at different rates for observers in different inertial frames of reference. A clock moving relative to an observer will be measured to tick slower than a clock that is stationary relative to the observer.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nWhere:\n*   `Δt` is the time elapsed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy).\n*   `Δt'` is the proper time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor depends on the relative velocity `v` and the speed of light `c`.\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = (60,000 km/s) / (300,000 km/s) = 0.2`\n\nNow, square this value:\n`(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\nNow, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n**4. Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n\nUsing the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n`Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n`Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\nSo, while 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n**5. Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**\n\nThe distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity (in that frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in that frame).\n`Distance = v * Δt`\n\nUsing the precise form for `Δt` for better accuracy:\n`Distance = v * (γ * Δt')`\n`Distance = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n`Distance = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`Distance = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`Distance ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n`Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n*   D) 2,940,000 km (This results from incorrectly multiplying by the `sqrt(1-v²/c²)` factor instead of dividing)\n\nOur calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option A. The small difference is due to rounding in the options.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe search results confirm my understanding of time dilation.\n\n*   **Time Dilation Formula**: The formula for time dilation is given as `t = t0 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `t` is the time observed in the stationary reference frame and `t0` is the time in the moving observer's own frame of reference (rest time). This matches my formula `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n*   **Stationary vs. Moving Frame**: The \"clock\" in motion slows down as observed by a stationary observer. In this problem, the ejecta is the moving frame, and the Galaxy is the stationary frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in the ejecta's frame, so it is the proper time (`t0` or `Δt₀`).\n*   **Calculation Process**: The problem asks for the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame. This requires calculating the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame (`t` or `Δt`), which will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. The distance is then this dilated time multiplied by the velocity.\n\nMy calculation steps are therefore correct.\n1.  **Given**:\n    *   Velocity (`v`) = 60,000 km/s\n    *   Proper time (`Δt₀`) = 50 s (time in the moving frame of the ejecta)\n    *   Speed of light (`c`) = 300,000 km/s\n2.  **Calculate `β = v/c`**:\n    *   `β = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n3.  **Calculate Lorentz factor `γ`**:\n    *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n4.  **Calculate dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy frame**:\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n5.  **Calculate distance `d` in the Galaxy frame**:\n    *   `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option A. The difference of ~1,862 km (or ~0.06%) is due to the rounding of the value in the provided option.\n\nI have confirmed the physics principles and the mathematical steps. The conclusion is robust.\n\nFinal check on the logic:\n- The question asks for a distance in the Galaxy frame.\n- `Distance = velocity × time`.\n- The velocity and time must be measured in the same frame (the Galaxy frame).\n- Velocity in Galaxy frame is given: 60,000 km/s.\n- Time in ejecta frame is given: 50 s.\n- To find the time in the Galaxy frame, we must use the time dilation formula, as clocks in the moving ejecta frame run slow compared to clocks in the Galaxy frame.\n- The time in the Galaxy frame will be longer than 50 s (`Δt = γ * 50s`, and `γ` is > 1).\n- Therefore the distance will be greater than the non-relativistic distance of `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This rules out options B, C, and D. Option A is the only one greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\nThis confirms the answer without even needing the exact calculation, just the understanding of the direction of the time dilation effect.\n\nThe calculation `d ≈ 3,061,862 km` confirms that A (`3,060,000 km`) is the intended answer.The problem involves the special theory of relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame of reference is the Galaxy.\n    *   The \"moving\" frame of reference is the supernova ejecta.\n\n2.  **Identify the given variables.**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (`v`) is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (`Δt₀`, also known as proper time) is 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light (`c`) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal.**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To calculate this, we need to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`).\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula.**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. The formula for time dilation is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n        where `Δt` is the time in the stationary frame, `Δt₀` is the time in the moving frame, and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (`β = v/c`):\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds have passed for an observer on the ejecta, about 51.031 seconds have passed for an observer in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n    *   The distance (`d`) is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time (`Δt`), both measured in the same (Galaxy) frame.\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   The calculated distance of approximately 3,061,860 km is very close to option A. The small difference is due to rounding in the intermediate steps.\n\nAlternatively, without an intermediate calculation, the distance is:\n`d = v * γ * Δt₀ = 60,000 * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km.` This value is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\nA conceptual check also points to option A: due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy frame is longer than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled must be greater than the non-relativistic calculation of `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. Option A is the only choice that is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference**: We have two frames of reference: the supernova ejecta's frame (the moving frame) and the Galaxy's frame (the stationary frame).\n2.  **Identify the Given Information**:\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time), `t_proper = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `299,792.458 km/s`.\n3.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation**: According to the theory of special relativity, time passes differently for observers in different frames of reference that are moving relative to each other.

This is known as the *proper time*.\n    *   Due to *time dilation*, an observer in the Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval `Δt` for the same event.\n    *   The relationship between the time `Δt` in the stationary frame and the proper time `Δt'` in the moving frame is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   We already found `β = v/c = 0.2`.\n    *   `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`.\n    *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n    *   Calculating the value: `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`.\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n    *   `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`.\n    *   `Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`.\n    *   This shows that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy measures about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   The distance is the velocity (measured in the Galaxy frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (also measured in the Galaxy frame).\n    *   `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `v` and `Δt`:\n        `d = (60,000 km/s) * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n    *   Our calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option D.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The key is to correctly identify that the given time of 50 seconds is the *proper time* (`Δt'`) because it is measured in the reference frame of the moving object (the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** One must apply the correct formula. Using `Δt = Δt' / γ` would be incorrect and would lead to option B.\n*   **Classical vs. Relativistic:** A purely classical calculation (`d = v * Δt' = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km`) ignores time dilation and leads to option C. The relativistic answer must be greater than the classical one in this case because the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame is longer than `Δt'`.\n*   **Consistency of Frames:** The distance in the Galaxy's frame must be calculated using the velocity and time as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n*   **Alternative Method (Length Contraction):** From the ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy travels is `d' = v * Δt' = 3,000,000 km`. This `d'` is a contracted length of the actual path `d` in the Galaxy's frame. The formula is `d' = d / γ`, so the proper path length is `d = d' * γ = 3,000,000 * γ = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`, which confirms the result.\n\nFinal calculation is `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862` km.

Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information\n\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame (Moving Frame):** This is the frame of reference of the supernova ejecta. The time that passes in this frame is the proper time, `Δt₀`.\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (Stationary Frame):** This is the frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.

Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To find this distance (`d`), we need to multiply the ejecta's velocity (`v`) by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`).\n\n`d = v * Δt`\n\n### 3.

Identify the Given Information:\n*   **Velocity (v):** The ejecta and the center of the Galaxy are moving towards each other at 60,000 km/s. This is the relative velocity between the two inertial frames of reference.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** 50 seconds is the time measured in the ejecta's own reference frame. Time measured in a moving frame of reference is known as proper time.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** For calculations, the speed of light is approximated as 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. The Goal:\nThe question asks for the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To find this distance, we need to know the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) and multiply it by the velocity (v).\n\n### 3. Time Dilation:\nAccording to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for events occurring in a moving frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nwhere:\n*   Δt is the time observed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy).\n*   Δt₀ is the proper time observed in the moving frame (the ejecta), which is 50 s.\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 4. Calculation Steps:\n\n**a. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, find the ratio of the velocity to the speed of light:\nv/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, square this value:\n(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n\nSubstitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n\n**b. Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\nUsing the time dilation formula:\nΔt = Δt₀ / √0.96 = 50 s / √0.96\n\n**c. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\nThe distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the Galaxy's frame:\nd = v * Δt\nd = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √0.96)\nd = 3,000,000 km / √0.96\n\nNow, we calculate the final value:\n√0.96 ≈ 0.9798\nd ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798\nd ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nThis calculated distance is closest to the multiple-choice option B. The non-relativistic calculation (60,000 km/s * 50 s) would yield 3,000,000 km (Option A), but time dilation means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer, resulting in a greater distance traveled.\n\nTherefore, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThis problem is a classic example of special relativity, specifically involving the concept of time dilation.

We want to find the distance traveled as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame:** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame, making it the *proper time*.\n\n**2. Understand Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving object (as measured by a stationary observer) passes more slowly than for the stationary observer. This effect, called time dilation, is significant at speeds approaching the speed of light. The time interval measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will be longer than the time interval measured in the moving frame (ejecta).\n\n**3.

Use the standard distance formula with the dilated time calculated in the previous step.\n    Distance = velocity × time\n    Distance = v * Δt\n    Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s\n    Distance ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\n**4.

Let's try an approximation that often works for these problems. For small `x`, `(1-x)^(-1/2) ≈ 1 + (1/2)x`.\nHere, `x = 0.04`.\n`γ ≈ 1 + (1/2) * 0.04 = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02`\n\n**Step D: Calculate the time in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\nUsing the approximate Lorentz factor:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s`\n\n**Careful Point:** Note that the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (51 s) is longer than the time measured on the ejecta's clock (50 s). This is the essence of time dilation.\n\n**Step E: Calculate the final distance (Δx).**\nNow substitute the values of `v` and `Δt` into the distance formula from Step A:\n`Δx = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51 s`\n`Δx ≈ 3,060,000 km`\n\n**4.

The time measured in this frame is the \"proper time\" (Δt₀), as it is the frame where the clock (the ejecta) is at rest.\n    *   Proper time (Δt₀) = 50 s\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (S):** This is considered the stationary frame of reference.

Understand Time Dilation\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect is called time dilation. The time that passes in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) will be longer than the 50 seconds that pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### 3.

Let's call them:\n        *   **S (Galaxy Frame):** This is the \"stationary\" reference frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n        *   **S' (Ejecta Frame):** This is the \"moving\" reference frame.\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is given. The Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at v = 60,000 km/s. By the principle of relativity, the ejecta is also moving at this speed relative to the Galaxy.\n        *   **v = 60,000 km/s**\n    *   The time interval is measured in the ejecta's reference frame (S').\n        *   **Δt' = 50 s**\n    *   The question asks for the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n        *   **Goal: Find d**\n\n2.  **Recognize the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The speed of the ejecta (60,000 km/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s). Therefore, we must use the principles of Special Relativity.\n    *   The key principle here is **Time Dilation**. A clock moving relative to an observer appears to tick slower than a stationary clock. The time measured in the moving frame (S') is the *proper time* (Δt₀ or Δt'), while the time measured by the stationary observer (in frame S) is the *dilated time* (Δt).\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   To find the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy frame (S), we need to use the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy frame (S).\n    *   We are given the time elapsed in the ejecta frame (S'), which is the proper time `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   We need to use the time dilation formula to find `Δt` from `Δt'`.\n    *   The time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   First, we must calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n\n### Execution of the Plan\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n\n*   The Lorentz factor is defined as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   First, find the ratio `β = v/c`:\n    *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    *   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`\n    *   `β = 60,000 / 300,000 = 6/30 = 1/5 = 0.2`\n*   Now, calculate `γ`:\n    *   `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt)**\n\n*   Use the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n*   We know `Δt' = 50 s` and `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n*   `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d)**\n\n*   Use the formula `d = v * Δt`.\n*   Substitute the expressions for `v` and `Δt`:\n    *   `d = (60,000 km/s) * [ (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s ]`\n*   Rearrange the terms for easier calculation:\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n*   Now, calculate the final value:\n    *   `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.979796`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979796 km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,961 km`\n\n**Step D: Compare the result with the given options**\n\n*   Our calculated distance is approximately 3,061,961 km.\n*   The options are:\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the result if relativistic effects were ignored).\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n*   The calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is due to rounding. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Proper Time:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame is the *proper time* (Δt'), because the clock measuring the time is at rest in that frame.\n2.  **Time Dilation Direction:** Remember that the time measured by the stationary observer (Δt) is always *longer* than the proper time (Δt'), because moving clocks run slow. This means `Δt = γ * Δt'`, and since `γ ≥ 1`, `Δt ≥ Δt'`.\n3.  **Frame Consistency:** When calculating the distance in the Galaxy frame (`d = v * Δt`), you must use the time measured in that same frame (`Δt`), not the time from the moving frame (`Δt'`).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThe problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation.

Time Dilation\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame of reference will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect, known as time dilation, means that the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`t`) will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`t = γ * t₀`\n\nwhere `t` is the time in the stationary observer's frame (the Galaxy), `t₀` is the proper time in the moving frame (the ejecta), and `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 3.

Calculate Time in the Galaxy's Frame (t)\nNow, use the time dilation formula:\n`t = γ * t₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\nSo, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, about 51.03 seconds pass in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### 5.

For many calculations, this is rounded to 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. Understand the Physics\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving object passes slower than for a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. To find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame, we first need to determine how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n### 3. The Formulas\nThe relationship between time in the stationary frame (Δt) and the proper time in the moving frame (Δt₀) is given by the time dilation formula:\n**Δt = γ * Δt₀**\n\nWhere **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n**γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)**\n\nOnce we find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt), the distance (d) traveled is calculated using the standard distance formula:\n**d = v * Δt**\n\n### 4. Calculation Steps\nLet's perform the calculation using the precise value for the speed of light (c = 299,792.458 km/s).\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n    *   v = 60,000 km/s\n    *   c = 299,792.458 km/s\n    *   (v/c)² = (60,000 / 299,792.458)² ≈ 0.0400554\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.0400554)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(0.9599446)\n    *   γ ≈ 1.02065\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame**\n    *   Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    *   Δt ≈ 1.02065 * 50 s\n    *   Δt ≈ 51.0325 s\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame**\n    *   d = v * Δt\n    *   d = 60,000 km/s * 51.0325 s\n    *   d ≈ 3,061,950 km\n\nThis result is extremely close to the value in option B. The minor discrepancy often arises because problems of this nature in textbooks or exams are designed with a rounded speed of light or a simplified Lorentz factor for easier calculation. For example, if we assume the time elapsed in the galaxy frame is exactly 51 seconds:\n*   d = 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km.\n\nThis matches option B exactly. This implies the intended Lorentz factor for the problem simplifies to γ = 51/50 = 1.02.\n\nBased on the calculations, the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThis is a problem of special relativity.

So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:** We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (frame S).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the time measured in the ejecta's frame (S', `Δt₀`).\n    *   The relationship between these times is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   Now, calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √(0.96))`\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Final Value:**\n    *   Using the code interpreter, we found `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        *   A) 3,060,000 km\n        *   B) 2,940,000 km\n        *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect non-relativistic answer)\n        *   D) 2,880,000 km\n    *   The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem involves a very high velocity (60,000 km/s) which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s). This tells us that we cannot use classical mechanics (`distance = velocity × time`) directly. We must apply the principles of Einstein's Special Relativity.\n*   **Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference:\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame: The Galaxy. Let's call this frame S. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   The \"moving\" frame: The supernova ejecta. Let's call this frame S'.\n*   **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Relative velocity between frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock), `Δt' = 50 s`. In relativity, the time measured in an object's own moving frame is called the **proper time**, denoted as `Δt₀`. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Determine the Goal:** We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n*   **Apply the Correct Relativistic Principle:** The key concept is **time dilation**. An observer in the stationary frame (S) will see time passing more slowly for the moving frame (S'). Therefore, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time (`Δt₀`).\n*   **Formulate the Equations:**\n    1.  The time dilation formula relates the two time intervals: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    2.  The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    3.  The distance in the Galaxy frame is calculated using the time measured in the Galaxy frame: `d = v * Δt`\n*   **Plan the Calculation:**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n    2.  Use `γ` to find the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.\n    3.  Use `Δt` to calculate the distance `d`.\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\nTo perform the calculation with high precision, we can use a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Relative velocity in km/s\nv = 60000\n# Proper time in the ejecta's frame, in seconds\ndt0 = 50\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 300000\n\n# --- Calculation steps ---\n\n# 1.

Determine the Goal**\nWe need to calculate the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**4. Apply the Time Dilation Formula**\nBecause the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v/c = 60,000/300,000 = 0.2`), the time measured in the stationary Galaxy frame (`Δt`) will be different from the time measured in the moving ejecta's frame (`Δt'`). This effect is called time dilation.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nWhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5.

It is moving at a velocity `v` relative to the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   **Velocity (v):** The problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. By the principle of relativity, the velocity of the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame is also `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time measured in the ejecta's own reference frame is 50 seconds. This is the proper time, so `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   **Speed of Light (c):** We will use the standard value `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation:**\n    According to the theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object as measured by a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The time elapsed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`) is related to the proper time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame, `Δt₀`) by the following formula:\n\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor depends on the velocity `v` and the speed of light `c`. It is calculated as:\n\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Reference Frame (Δt):**\n    Using the time dilation formula from Step 2, we can find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame:\n\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Reference Frame:**\n    The distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame.\n\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n    `Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n    Alternatively, using the exact formula:\n    `Distance = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `Distance = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `Distance = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `Distance ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.
