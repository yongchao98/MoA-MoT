To solve it, we need to analyze the target molecule and consider the directing effects of the substituents, steric hindrance, and possible functional group interconversions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1: A strong activating group, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2: A weak activating group, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3: A strong deactivating group, meta director.\n\n*   **Relative positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe most striking feature is that the nitro group is *meta* to the strongly activating ethoxy group. A standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) like nitration on a precursor containing the ethoxy group would strongly direct the nitro group to the ortho and para positions, not the meta position. This suggests that either:\na) The group at position 1 was a meta-director during the nitration step.\nb) A blocking group was used to force nitration into the desired position.\nc) The nitro group was introduced by a non-EAS mechanism.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's consider the final steps. The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis, as this is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect other groups.\n*   **Final Step:** Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr or NaOEt).\n*   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to synthesizing **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern (-OH, -tBu, -NO2). This is still a challenging synthesis. A powerful strategy for controlling substitution patterns is the use of a **blocking group**, typically a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be introduced and later removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**3. A Plausible Synthetic Route**\n\nLet's outline a logical synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol starting from a simpler material like phenol (which can be made from benzene).\n\n1.  **Start with Phenol.**\n2.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** React phenol with a tert-butyl source (e.g., tert-butanol/acid or tert-butyl chloride/catalyst). This gives a mixture of *o*- and *p*-tert-butylphenol. We need the *ortho* isomer. Let's assume we can separate **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n3.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** React o-tert-butylphenol with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). The -OH and -tBu groups are both ortho/para directors. They will both direct the incoming -SO3H group to position 4 (para to -OH, meta to -tBu) and position 6 (ortho to -OH, ortho to -tBu). The para position (4) is sterically more accessible.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Nitration:** Now, nitrate this intermediate with HNO3/H2SO4. The available positions are 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   -OH (position 1) directs ortho/para (to 3, 5).\n    *   -tBu (position 2) directs ortho/para (to 3, 5).\n    *   -SO3H (position 4) directs meta (to 3, 5).\n    *   All three groups direct the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is sterically hindered, being between the -OH and -tBu groups. However, it is electronically activated by both. Let's assume the reaction can be forced to yield the desired isomer.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-1-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking Step):** Heat the product from the previous step with dilute aqueous acid (e.g., dilute H2SO4 or H3O+/Heat). This removes the sulfonic acid group.\n    *   Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n6.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** React the phenol with a base (NaOH) and an ethylating agent (EtBr).\n    *   Final Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow let's see which option matches this logical pathway. The key strategic elements are the use of sulfonation/desulfonation as a blocking strategy and the final conversion of a phenol to an ether.\n\n*   **Option A & B:** These sequences contain chemically impossible steps. Option A attempts diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) on a nitro compound. Option B suggests nitrating a diazonium salt. Both are incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence does not effectively use a blocking group strategy to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern and would likely lead to other isomers.\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nLet's analyze this option.\n*   It contains all the necessary reagents for the plausible synthesis outlined above: nitration, reduction, alkylation, diazotization, sulfonation, desulfonation (hydrolysis), and etherification.\n*   The final steps, **(viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat** followed by **(ix) NaOH/EtBr**, perfectly match the logical final steps of our proposed synthesis (desulfonation/hydrolysis to a phenol, then etherification).\n*   While the order of the preceding steps (i-vii) appears confusing and may contain typos or represent an alternative, highly complex pathway, the presence of the correct \"toolkit\" of reagents and the logical final steps make it the most plausible choice. The other options are fundamentally flawed with impossible reactions. The synthesis I outlined can be constructed by rearranging the steps in option C and using some reagents to first synthesize phenol from benzene (i, ii, v, viii).\n\nGiven the choices, Option C represents the only viable overall strategy, even if the sequence as written is problematic. It is the \"best\" answer among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and evaluate the proposed synthetic routes.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The groups are in a 1,2,3-arrangement.\n*   -OEt is at C1, -tBu is at C2, and -NO2 is at C3.\n*   Relative positions: -OEt and -tBu are *ortho*; -OEt and -NO2 are *meta*; -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho*.\n\n**Analysis of Directing Effects:**\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings substituted with a nitro group.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A & B:** These sequences involve sulfonation and subsequent reactions. However, they contain steps in an illogical order. For instance, option A calls for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) at step (iv) when no primary aromatic amine has been formed. Option B calls for nitration of a diazonium salt at step (vi), which is not a standard transformation for this type of synthesis. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Even if the amine were protected (e.g., as an acetanilide), alkylation would predominantly occur at the para position, not yielding the necessary ortho-substituted product in high yield. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence represents a common and logical strategy in multi-step aromatic synthesis: introduce groups, modify their directing effects, and use them to place subsequent substituents correctly.\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is overwhelmingly the para isomer, **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**. This is a high-yield step.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **p-tert-butylaniline**. This reaction changes the substituent from a meta-director to a powerful ortho, para-director.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The strongly activating amino group and the tert-butyl group both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the amine. This forms **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, giving **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nAt this point, the main framework is constructed. The final two steps listed in option D, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, are redundant as they would add and then immediately remove a sulfonic acid group from the molecule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe synthesis outlined in steps (i) through (vii) of option D is a chemically sound, high-yield pathway. However, it produces **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule named in the question. The other options (A, B, C) contain chemically flawed steps. Given that this is a multiple-choice question, it is highly probable that there is a typo in the name of the target compound in the question prompt, and that the valid synthetic pathway presented in option D is the intended correct answer. It is the only sequence that follows a logical and high-yield synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The desired product is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. This is a benzene ring with three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. The key feature is the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:** We will examine each proposed reaction sequence to see if it is chemically logical and if it leads to the desired substitution pattern.\n\n3.  **Option A Analysis:**\n    *   `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n    *   `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n    *   `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This step is not efficient.\n    *   Furthermore, step `vi) SO3/H2SO4` on a diazonium salt from step `v)` is not a standard reaction. This option is chemically flawed.\n\n4.  **Option C Analysis:**\n    *   This sequence lists `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) immediately after `iii) SO3/H2SO4`. Diazotization requires an aromatic primary amine, which has not been formed at this stage. This sequence is out of order and incorrect.\n\n5.  **Option D Analysis:**\n    *   This sequence lists `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` (nitration) on a diazonium salt formed in step `v)`. Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard synthetic procedure. This option is chemically flawed.\n\n6.  **Option B Analysis:** This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze it in detail.\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but sterically hinders the ortho position. The major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. This yields **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. This is the key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a strong deactivator and a **meta-director**. The t-butyl group at position 4 is an ortho,para-director.\n        *   The -NH3+ group at C1 directs the incoming nitro group to C3.\n        *   The -tBu group at C4 directs the incoming nitro group to C3 (which is ortho to it).\n        *   Both groups direct the substitution to the same position (C3). This leads to the formation of **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amine group to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   Steps `viii)` and `ix)` (sulfonation and desulfonation) are redundant and do not alter the product from step `vii`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The sequence in Option B produces 1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene. This is an isomer of the target molecule (2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene). However, Options A, C, and D contain chemically nonsensical steps. Option B describes a valid, albeit complex, synthesis pathway. It is the only chemically coherent choice, suggesting there is likely an error in the name of the target molecule in the problem statement.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The relationship between the groups is:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects is crucial for planning the order of substitution reactions.\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-butyl (-tBu)**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it favors *para* substitution.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino (-NH2)** (as an intermediate): Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Anilinium (-NH3+)** (formed from -NH2 in strong acid): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence**\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to see if it's chemically sound and leads to the desired product.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\nii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\niii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation. (Plausible)\niv) **NaNO2/HCl**: This is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). At this stage, there is no amine group on the molecule.\nThis sequence is incorrect because the reagents are in the wrong order.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene → Nitrobenzene. (Plausible)\nii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene → Aniline. (Plausible)\niii) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the nitrogen atom in the amino group. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the alkylation reaction.\nThis sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\nii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid (major product). (Plausible)\niii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Plausible)\niv) Fe/HCl: Reduction of nitro group → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. (Plausible)\nv) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization → Diazonium salt. (Plausible)\nvi) **HNO3/H2SO4**: This step attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates. Treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure; they would likely decompose.\nThis sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nBy elimination, this should be the correct sequence. Let's analyze it carefully. The synthesis of a 1,2,3-substituted product is often challenging and may involve steps with low yields. We must determine if this path is at least chemically possible.\n\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\nii) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The *para* isomer (4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) is major due to sterics, but the *ortho* isomer (**1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To get the final 1,2,3-product, we must proceed with the *ortho* isomer, even if it's a minor product.\niii) **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group. 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene → **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (Standard reduction).\niv) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. We need to introduce the new nitro group at position 3 (relative to the final product numbering), which is *meta* to the anilinium group and *ortho* to the tert-butyl group. While the directing effects are conflicting and the yield may be low, the formation of **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** is plausible.\nv) **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. (Standard reaction).\nvi) **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (Standard reaction).\nvii) **NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is the desired final product.\n\nSteps (viii) SO3/H2SO4 and (ix) dilute H2SO4 are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed. They might be included as red herrings or represent an error in the question's formulation. However, the core sequence (i-vii) is the only one among the options that can chemically lead to the target molecule, even if some steps are not high-yield.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a chemically plausible (though not necessarily high-yield) route to the target product. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   Three substituents:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted or vicinal substitution pattern.\n*   The directing effects of the groups are:\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt is ortho to -tBu.\n*   -tBu is ortho to -NO2.\n*   -OEt is meta to -NO2.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires a careful strategy, frequently involving blocking groups to control the regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA common final step for synthesizing an ether is the **Williamson ether synthesis**. This means the immediate precursor would be the corresponding phenol.\n*   **Final Step:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    This matches step (ix) in option A: `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to synthesizing the precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   The phenol group (-OH) is typically introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+). This is done with `H2O/Heat`. This matches step (vii) in option A.\n*   The diazonium salt is formed from a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) using `NaNO2/HCl`. This matches step (v) in option A.\n\nThis suggests a strategy where we construct a complex aniline derivative, convert it to a phenol, and then to an ether. The sulfonic acid group (`SO3H`) is a common tool in such multi-step syntheses, acting as a blocking group and a directing group, which can be removed later by **desulfonation** (using `dilute H2SO4/Heat`). This matches step (viii) in option A.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed sequences based on this understanding.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by making aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and causing meta-alkylation. This is not a clean or efficient method. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** Both start with `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` to make tert-butylbenzene, followed by `ii) HNO3/H2SO4` (nitration).\n    Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of ortho- and para-isomers. The para-isomer is major (~70-80%), but the ortho-isomer is also formed. A synthesis that starts with a mixture is generally not considered \"high-yield\". Furthermore, Option C has an impossible step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` on a molecule without an amino group. Option B proceeds to nitrate an aniline derivative directly (`iv) HNO3/H2SO4`), which is a very messy reaction prone to oxidation and poor control. Thus, B and C are unlikely to be correct.\n\n*   **Option A:** Let's analyze this sequence in detail, as it seems the most promising.\n\n    i) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.**\n       *   Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    ii) **tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the sterically accessible para position. This is a high-yield, regioselective step. This is a classic use of a blocking group.\n\n    iii) **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both groups direct the incoming -NO2 group to the same position (position 2, which is ortho to -tBu and meta to -SO3H). This is another high-yield, regioselective step.\n\n    iv) **... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. Standard procedure.\n\n    v) **... + NaNO2/HCl → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfobenzenediazonium chloride.**\n       *   Diazotization of the amino group. Standard procedure.\n\n    At this point, we have a diazonium salt with the substituents correctly positioned for further manipulation. The subsequent steps are confusingly written but represent the necessary transformations to reach the final product.\n\n    vi) **... + HNO3/H2SO4**\n       *   This step is the most confusing. It is likely a typo or represents a more complex transformation. A plausible interpretation in the context of a complex synthesis puzzle is a second nitration. The existing groups (-N2+, -tBu, -SO3H) would all direct an incoming electrophile to position 6. Let's assume this happens.\n       *   Product: **6-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfobenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n    vii) **... + H3O+, H2O/Heat**\n       *   This step converts the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n       *   Product: **6-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfophenol**.\n\n    viii) **... + dilute H2SO4**\n       *   This step is desulfonation, removing the -SO3H group.\n       *   Product: **3-(tert-butyl)-5-nitrophenol**. This is not the correct precursor.\n\n    **Revisiting the Logic:**\n    Despite the confusing final steps, the initial sequence of Option A (i, ii, iii) is the most logical and efficient way to create a specific trisubstituted intermediate from benzene in high yield. The other options have clear flaws in their early steps (creating mixtures or using problematic reactions). It is common in such problems for the correct option to represent the best overall strategy, even if it contains typos or obscure steps. The strategy in A is to use a para-blocking group (-SO3H) to force subsequent substitutions into specific positions, which is the correct approach for this type of target. The subsequent steps involve the correct types of reagents (for reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, desulfonation, and etherification) to convert the intermediate into the final product, even if their exact sequence or purpose as written is ambiguous. Given the clear flaws in B, C, and D, A remains the most plausible choice.\n\n    Let's assume a different, more logical sequence of the later steps that leads to the correct product, which the question author might have intended.\n    Starting from **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid** (product of step iv):\n    1.  Nitrate (this would be step vi). This requires protection of the amine, then nitration (which goes to position 3 or 5), then deprotection. Let's assume it goes to position 3. Product: **2-amino-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    2.  Diazotize the amino group (step v).\n    3.  Replace the diazonium group with -H (deamination, e.g., with H3PO2, a common reaction not explicitly listed but could be implied by the overall transformation). Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  Replace the -SO3H group with -OH (e.g., by alkali fusion, another step not listed but necessary). Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is the correct precursor.\n    5.  Etherify with NaOH/EtBr (step ix).\n\n    While this requires steps not listed, it shows that the intermediate from A(iv) can be converted to the target. The key is that the initial steps of A are the only ones that set up the regiochemistry correctly in a high-yield manner.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A provides the most chemically sound strategy for a high-yield synthesis, especially in the crucial initial steps that establish the substitution pattern. The other options involve steps that would lead to mixtures or are chemically infeasible. Therefore, despite the confusing nature of the later steps, Option A is the best answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of the proposed options is necessary, considering the directing effects of the substituents and the compatibility of the reactions.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. This 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is sterically crowded, and its synthesis requires careful planning of the reaction order.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option A:** This sequence starts with the tert-butylation of benzene, followed by nitration. The tert-butyl group is ortho, para-directing, but due to its large size, it primarily directs incoming groups to the para position. This would lead to 4-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene, making it difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Analysis of Option B:** This sequence begins with the nitration of benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. The third step is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, and the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) would react with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this pathway is not viable.\n*   **Analysis of Option C:** This route involves using a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a blocking group. After tert-butylation, sulfonation occurs at the para position. Subsequent nitration would be directed to the position ortho to the tert-butyl group. This leads to a 1,2,4-substituted intermediate, which is not the correct isomer for the final product.\n*   **Analysis of Option D:** This sequence presents the most chemically sound, albeit complex, route to the target molecule.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. For this synthesis, the ortho isomer is required, which would need to be separated.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is reduced to an amino group, forming 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a critical step. In the strongly acidic nitrating mixture, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). This ion is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to positions 3 and 5. This is a known strategy for synthesizing such substitution patterns. The desired 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is formed, along with the 5-nitro isomer.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group of 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide to form the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nThe subsequent steps (viii and ix) in option D appear to be extraneous, but the core sequence from (i) to (vii) correctly and logically produces the desired compound. This makes Option D the only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe user wants to identify the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents to determine a logical synthetic strategy.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The substituents are a tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   They are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   -OEt is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   -tBu is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards):**\n\n1.  **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is typically added last via a Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr) on the corresponding phenol. The immediate precursor is therefore **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n2.  **Phenol Formation:** A common way to introduce a hydroxyl group onto a benzene ring is through the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt (e.g., adding H₃O⁺/H₂O and heat). The precursor for this step would be the diazonium salt derived from **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n3.  **Diazonium Salt Formation:** This is achieved by treating an aniline with nitrous acid (NaNO₂/HCl). The precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n4.  **Synthesis of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the most challenging step, as it requires establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. Let's analyze the options to see how this might be achieved. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is complex; the powerful amino group directs ortho and para (to positions 4 and 6), not the desired position 3. A more controlled method is needed.\n\nLet's evaluate the provided options based on fundamental principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with nitration (i) to form nitrobenzene. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation (iii) on the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring would fail or give a very low yield. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is chemically illogical. Step (iv) is the diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl), which requires an amine. However, the amine is not formed until step (viii) (Fe/HCl reduction). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that has not yet been created. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is also illogical. An amine is formed in step (iv) and converted to a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt, which is not a standard or viable reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, with o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene as a minor product. For a high-yield synthesis, we must follow the major product.\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. This converts p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene to **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is a very strong ortho, para-director. To avoid oxidation and control the reaction, the amine is typically protected first (e.g., by acetylation, a step often implied in such problems). The directing effect of the resulting acetamido group (-NHCOCH₃) is still strongly ortho-directing. Nitration will occur at the position ortho to the amine/acetamido group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline** (after deprotection).\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline to form a **diazonium salt**.\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, resulting in **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`: These last two steps, sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and appear to be extraneous.\n\nWhile steps (i) through (vii) of option B outline a coherent synthesis, they produce an isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) of the desired product. The other options (A, C, D) contain fundamental flaws in their reaction order. Given the choices, Option B is the only one that contains a plausible (though flawed) multi-step synthetic sequence. It is highly likely that there is an error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the listed steps. However, among the given choices, B represents the most chemically reasonable sequence, despite its inconsistencies.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a thorough analysis of each proposed route is necessary, paying close attention to the directing effects of the substituents and the viability of each reaction.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nLet's evaluate the provided options:\n\n**Option A:**\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, while the desired 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is the minor product. This step already compromises the \"high-yield\" objective.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene gives 2-(tert-butyl)aniline.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Crucially, both the -NH3+ group (at C1) and the -tBu group (at C2) direct incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5. This reaction can produce the required 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline, although likely as a mixture with the 5-nitro isomer.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group in 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline forms a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, forming the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n8.  **viii) SO3/H2SO4 & ix) dilute H2SO4:** These final two steps, sulfonation and desulfonation, are superfluous as the target molecule has already been synthesized.\n\nDespite the low-yield steps and the extraneous final steps, this sequence is chemically plausible and leads to the correct product structure.\n\n**Option B:** This sequence introduces a blocking group (-SO3H) but contains a chemically incorrect step: `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt is not a standard transformation. The overall order of reactions is also illogical for producing the target molecule.\n\n**Option C:** This option is flawed at step `iv) NaNO2/HCl`, which attempts to form a diazonium salt from a substrate that does not contain an amino group.\n\n**Option D:** This sequence fails at step `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A is the only sequence that presents a chemically viable, albeit not high-yielding, pathway to the target molecule. The other options contain fundamentally flawed chemical steps. Therefore, despite its imperfections, Option A is the best choice among the given alternatives.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a vicinal (1,2,3) trisubstituted benzene. The directing effects of the substituents are:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nSynthesizing such a sterically crowded molecule with this specific electronic arrangement requires a carefully planned multi-step synthesis, often involving blocking groups or building the molecule from a precursor where the directing effects align favorably.\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nLet's think backward from the product (retrosynthesis).\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is an ether. The most common way to form an aryl ether is the Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide (from a phenol) with an alkyl halide.\n    *   Precursor: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   Reaction: Deprotonation with a base (like NaOH) followed by reaction with an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr).\n    *   This corresponds to the reagent `NaOH/EtBr` found in the options.\n\n*   **Key Intermediate:** Our main challenge is to synthesize the precursor, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Key Intermediate:** How can we make 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol? Let's consider adding the substituents to a simpler ring.\n    *   **Path A: Start with m-nitrophenol and add a tert-butyl group.**\n        *   In m-nitrophenol (OH at C1, NO2 at C3), we need to add a t-Bu group at C2.\n        *   Let's check the directing effects for Friedel-Crafts alkylation:\n            *   The -OH group is a strong activator and directs *ortho* (to C2, C6) and *para* (to C4).\n            *   The -NO2 group is a strong deactivator and directs *meta* (to C5).\n            *   The powerful -OH group controls the reaction. It directs the incoming electrophile (the t-butyl cation) to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n            *   Alkylation at position 2 gives the desired product: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. While a mixture with 4- and 6-alkylated products is expected, this is a plausible way to form the required C-C bond at the correct position.\n\n    *   **Path B: Start with 2-tert-butylphenol and add a nitro group.**\n        *   In 2-tert-butylphenol (OH at C1, tBu at C2), we need to nitrate at C3.\n        *   Directing effects for nitration:\n            *   -OH directs *ortho* (C6) and *para* (C4).\n            *   -tBu directs *ortho* (C3) and *para* (C5).\n            *   The -OH group is a much stronger activator than -tBu and will dominate, leading to nitration at positions 4 and 6. This path will not yield the desired 3-nitro product.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** Path A is the more plausible route. The synthesis should proceed through m-nitrophenol.\n\n**3. Construct the Full Synthesis from Benzene**\n\nNow, let's build the full sequence, starting from benzene, to get to the final product via Path A.\n\n*   **Step 1: Synthesis of m-Nitrophenol from Benzene.**\n    This is a standard textbook synthesis:\n    a.  **Nitration:** Benzene is nitrated to form nitrobenzene. (Reagent: `HNO3/H2SO4`)\n    b.  **Second Nitration:** Nitrobenzene is nitrated again under harsher conditions. The -NO2 group is a meta-director, so this forms m-dinitrobenzene. (Reagent: `HNO3/H2SO4`)\n    c.  **Selective Reduction:** One of the two nitro groups in m-dinitrobenzene is selectively reduced to an amino group using a reagent like Na2S or (NH4)2S. The options provide `Fe/HCl`, which typically reduces all nitro groups, but for the sake of a multiple-choice question, we may have to assume it can be controlled or it's the intended reagent for reduction. This step yields m-nitroaniline. (Reagent: `Fe/HCl`)\n    d.  **Diazotization:** The amino group of m-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. (Reagent: `NaNO2/HCl`)\n    e.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in an aqueous acidic solution to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming m-nitrophenol. (Reagent: `H3O+, H2O/Heat`)\n\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation of m-Nitrophenol.**\n    f.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** m-Nitrophenol is reacted with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst to introduce the tert-butyl group. As determined earlier, this can yield the desired 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. (Reagent: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`)\n\n*   **Step 3: Etherification.**\n    g.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to its conjugate base with NaOH, which then reacts with ethyl bromide to form the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. (Reagent: `NaOH/EtBr`)\n\n**4. Match the Synthesis with the Given Options**\n\nLet's see which option provides the necessary reagents for this 7-step synthesis. The required reagents are:\n`HNO3/H2SO4` (used twice), `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nLet's examine the reagent list for each option:\n*   **A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4\n*   C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr\n*   D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nOption A contains all the necessary reagents for our proposed synthesis:\n*   `HNO3/H2SO4` (listed twice, as ii and ix)\n*   `Fe/HCl` (listed as viii)\n*   `NaNO2/HCl` (listed as iv)\n*   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (listed as vi)\n*   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (listed as i)\n*   `NaOH/EtBr` (listed as vii)\n\nThe other options are missing key reagents or include steps that lead to the wrong isomer. For example, Option C involves Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (step iii), which is not a feasible reaction. Options B and D, through logical application of their steps, would lead to 1,2,4- or 1,3,4-substituted isomers, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n\nAlthough the sequence of reactions in Option A is written in a scrambled and incorrect order, it is the only option that provides the complete set of reagents required for a plausible (though complex) synthesis of the target molecule. Therefore, it is the best choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's draw its structure and identify the substituents and their relative positions.\n\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern, which is sterically crowded.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents direct incoming groups:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It's very bulky, which influences regioselectivity.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's consider the final step of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Could the last step be nitration?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene. The powerful activating -OEt group would direct nitration to its para position (C4) and ortho position (C6). The desired C3 position is meta to the -OEt group, so this would be a very minor product. This is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Could the last step be Friedel-Crafts alkylation?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The -OEt group (o,p-director) and the -NO2 group (m-director) both direct incoming electrophiles to positions 2, 4, and 6. However, the bulky tert-butyl group would preferentially add to the least sterically hindered position (likely C4 or C6), not the highly hindered C2 position between two existing groups. Also, Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on deactivated rings. This is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Could the last step be ether formation?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. The conversion of a phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt) using Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH to form the phenoxide, followed by EtBr) is a standard, high-yield reaction. This is a very plausible final step.\n    *   **Step vii) NaOH/EtBr** is consistent with this.\n\nNow, how to synthesize the precursor, **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**?\nA common way to make phenols is via the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, which is made from an aniline.\n*   Phenol Precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n*   Reaction Sequence: ...-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> ...-N2+ --(H3O+/Heat)--> ...-OH.\n    *   **Step v) NaNO2/HCl** and **Step vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat** are consistent with this.\n\nNow, how to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**?\nLet's renumber this molecule for easier synthetic planning: 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. This has the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern. It is very difficult to create this pattern by direct substitution onto a simple benzene derivative.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options, as they must contain the correct (or most plausible) path. The options seem to have typos and extra steps, so we must focus on the core chemical transformations.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **Option A & B:** Contain chemically illogical steps, such as attempting diazotization on a molecule without an amine group (A) or nitrating a diazonium salt (B). These are incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. FC alkylation on aniline is problematic; it typically requires protection of the amine or occurs on the anilinium ion (meta-directing). Neither route easily leads to the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern after subsequent nitration.\n*   **Option D:** This option seems the most promising, despite its confusing structure. Let's analyze the sequence of transformations it suggests, even if the order or completeness is flawed.\n\n**5. Detailed Analysis of the most plausible pathway (based on reagents in Option D)**\n\nA viable, albeit complex, route to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with this pattern involves dinitration followed by selective reduction. Let's see if the reagents in Option D fit this path.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is major, but the ortho isomer is also formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n3.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** A second nitration. Nitrating o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (C1-tBu, C2-NO2). Both the -tBu group (o,p-directing) and the -NO2 group (m-directing) direct the second nitro group to positions 4 and 6. This gives a mixture of 2,4-dinitro- and **2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene**. Let's assume we can isolate the desired **2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n4.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of a nitro group. In 2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene, the two nitro groups are equivalent. A controlled reduction (e.g., using (NH4)2S, but Fe/HCl can also be used) can reduce one of them to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization. The amino group of 2-amino-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis. The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming **2-hydroxy-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson Ether Synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH and then treated with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the ether, yielding **2-ethoxy-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nLet's check the name of this final product according to IUPAC rules. The priority for numbering is -OEt > -tBu > -NO2.\n*   The carbon with the -OEt group is C1.\n*   The adjacent carbon with the -tBu group is C2.\n*   The next carbon with the -NO2 group is C3.\nThe name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This matches the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions described above successfully produces the target molecule. This sequence uses the reagents listed in Option D. Although the order of steps (iii) and (iv) is swapped in the option text and there are superfluous steps (viii, ix) listed at the end, Option D is the only one that contains the necessary reagents for a chemically plausible synthesis. The other options contain fundamentally incorrect chemical steps. Therefore, despite its flaws, Option D represents the correct synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. A successful synthesis depends on introducing the substituents in the correct order, taking into account their directing effects and the chemical compatibility of the reactions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Substituents**\n\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents and their properties:**\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the ortho position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Intermediates:** To introduce the -OEt group, a common strategy is to first create a phenol (-OH) and then perform a Williamson ether synthesis. A phenol can be made from an amino group (-NH₂) via a diazonium salt. An amino group is typically made by reducing a nitro group.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical validity:\n\n**Option D:**\ni) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene. (Valid)\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline. (Valid)\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction **fails** when attempted on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents the alkylation reaction.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect because step (iii) is not a viable reaction.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\niii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of the product from step (ii). (Valid)\niv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: This reagent combination is used for diazotization, a reaction that converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt. The substrate from step (iii) is not an amine.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect because step (iv) is performed on an inappropriate substrate.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\niii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of the product from step (ii). (Valid)\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. (Valid)\nv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\nvi) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: This step proposes reacting the diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture. This is **not a standard or logical synthetic transformation**. The goal is to create a phenol to later form the ether, which is typically achieved by heating the diazonium salt in aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect because step (vi) is chemically nonsensical in this context.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is a minor product, but it is formed. (Valid step)\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene to yield 2-tert-butylaniline. (Valid)\niv) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3, yielding 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. (Valid step)\nv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\nvi) `H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form the corresponding phenol, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. (Valid)\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to a phenoxide by NaOH, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ether product. (Valid)\nviii) & ix): The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are superfluous and would not be part of an efficient synthesis, but the core pathway from (i) to (vii) is chemically sound.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Option A, while not ideal in terms of yield due to poor regioselectivity in some steps, represents the only chemically plausible pathway from start to finish among the choices provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nOf course. Here is a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the reasoning process to determine the correct synthetic pathway.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the desired product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n    *   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1.\n    *   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2.\n    *   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3.\n*   **Directing Effects:** Understanding how these groups influence further substitutions is crucial.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. However, it is very large (sterically bulky), which strongly hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** A strongly activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **The Core Synthetic Challenge:** The main difficulty in this synthesis is placing a substituent *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. A standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will almost exclusively yield the *para* product due to steric hindrance. A successful synthesis must therefore use a specific strategy to overcome this.\n\n### **2. Evaluation of the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option to see if it is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n#### **Option D: Incorrect**\n1.  `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. **This reaction fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) is an acid that reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the alkylation reaction.\n\n#### **Option B: Incorrect**\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (the para product is major).\n3.  `iii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step ii.\n4.  `iv) NaNO2/HCl`: This is a diazotization reaction. **This reaction fails.** Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine.\n\n#### **Option C: Incorrect (Leads to the Wrong Isomer)**\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As established, due to the steric bulk of the -tBu group, the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n3.  The rest of the synthesis would proceed from this 1,4-disubstituted (para) intermediate. It is impossible to rearrange this structure to the required 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. This sequence would produce an isomer of the target molecule, but not the target molecule itself.\n\n#### **Option A: Correct Strategy**\nThis sequence employs a clever and necessary strategy using a **blocking group**.\n\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  `ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) adds to the sterically most accessible position, which is *para* to the tert-butyl group. This forms **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The purpose of this step is to **block** the para position.\n3.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now that the *para* position is blocked, the incoming nitro group is forced to go to a position *ortho* to the tert-butyl group. Both existing groups direct the new substituent to this same position:\n    *   The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, and since *para* is blocked, it directs *ortho*.\n    *   The -SO₃H group is a *m*-director, and it also directs to the position *ortho* to the -tBu group.\n    This step successfully creates an intermediate with the crucial *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups.\n\n**Conclusion:** Although the later steps (iv-ix) in option A appear jumbled and may contain typos, the initial strategy (steps i-iii) is the **only one** presented that correctly solves the main chemical problem of forcing substitution ortho to a bulky tert-butyl group. In multiple-choice chemistry questions, you must identify the sequence that contains the correct core strategy, even if the full sequence is imperfectly written.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's assign the positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: -OEt (ethoxy group), a strong activator and ortho, para-director.\n*   Position 2: -tBu (tert-butyl group), a weak activator and ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, strongly favoring para-substitution.\n*   Position 3: -NO2 (nitro group), a strong deactivator and meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3-arrangement. This is a sterically crowded pattern that is often difficult to achieve through standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, which typically favor 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns depending on the directing groups. A successful synthesis will likely require a careful ordering of reactions and possibly the use of blocking groups.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group is an o,p-director, but strongly favors substitution at the para position due to sterics. The major product is 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The ortho isomer is a minor product. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would not rely on a minor product. Let's assume we proceed with the major para-isomer.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylaniline.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The -NH2 is at C1, -tBu at C4. Both -NH3+ and -tBu direct substitution to the C2 position. Product: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium salt.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene.\nThis final product has a 1,2,4 substitution pattern, which is not the desired 1,2,3 target molecule. Therefore, option A is incorrect. The final two steps (viii, ix) are also superfluous.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThe sequence of reagents is nonsensical. For example, step (iv) is `NaNO2/HCl`, which is used for diazotization of an amine. However, the substrate after step (iii) (5-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid) is not an amine. The reduction step (`Fe/HCl`) appears much later at step (viii). This option is chemically illogical and incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option employs a blocking group strategy, which is often necessary for synthesizing complex substitution patterns.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene. (High yield)\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the para position. → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. This step effectively \"blocks\" the para position. (High yield)\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a meta-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6). → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (High yield, good regioselectivity)\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. → 2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid salt.\nUp to this point, the synthesis is logical and proceeds with high yield and selectivity, producing a key intermediate. The remaining steps must transform this intermediate into the final product. The sequence as written has some ambiguities or potential typos (e.g., step vi, `HNO3/H2SO4`, seems out of place). However, let's analyze the necessary transformations and see if the provided reagents can accomplish them in a plausible (even if reordered) sequence.\nWe need to:\n1.  Replace the diazonium group (-N2+) with an ethoxy group (-OEt). This is typically done by converting it to a phenol (`H3O+, H2O/Heat` - step vii) and then performing a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr` - step ix).\n2.  Introduce a nitro group at the correct position (C3 in the final product). This requires nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4` - step vi).\n3.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group (-SO3H). This is done by heating with dilute acid (`dilute H2SO4` - step viii).\n\nA plausible (though not explicitly written in the correct order in the option) continuation would be:\n1.  Start with 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (after step iv).\n2.  Protect the amine (e.g., acetylation, an implied step).\n3.  Nitrate. The directing groups would place the NO2 group at C6 (relative to the amine).\n4.  Deprotect the amine.\n5.  Remove the sulfonic acid group (desulfonation).\n6.  Diazotize the amine, convert to phenol, then etherify.\nThis is getting very complicated. However, compared to the other options, option C presents the most viable synthetic strategy, using a blocking group to control regiochemistry. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental (wrong product, failed reaction, nonsensical order). Therefore, option C is the best choice among the given possibilities, assuming some ambiguity or error in the statement of the later steps. It correctly identifies the key strategic elements for constructing a complex aromatic molecule.\n\nFinal Decision: Options A, B, and D are clearly incorrect due to producing the wrong isomer, a failed reaction, or an illogical sequence. Option C provides the only rational strategic framework (using a blocking group) to potentially access the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern, making it the most plausible answer despite the confusing ordering of its final steps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequences to determine the correct option for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### Target Molecule Analysis\n\n*   **Structure:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy): Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl): Activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern (1,2,3):**\n    *   The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The ethoxy and nitro groups are *meta* to each other.\n    *   The tert-butyl and nitro groups are *ortho* to each other.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\nThe key challenges are the *meta* relationship between the powerful ortho/para-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group, and achieving the crowded 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. Direct nitration of a molecule containing an ethoxy group would not place the nitro group in the meta position. This suggests the ethoxy group is formed late in the synthesis from a precursor that directs differently or that its directing influence is overcome.\n\nA common and versatile method to introduce a hydroxyl group (a precursor to the ethoxy group) is via the diazotization of an aniline (-NH2), followed by hydrolysis. The aniline itself is typically formed by the reduction of a nitro group. This suggests the following transformation is likely part of the synthesis: -NH2 → -N2+ → -OH → -OEt.\n\nIf this is the case, the key intermediate to synthesize is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n### Evaluation of Synthetic Pathways to 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline and the final product.\n\nLet's evaluate the most plausible synthesis route based on the reactions provided in the options, even if the options themselves appear scrambled. A chemically sound, high-yield synthesis would proceed as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is reacted with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** To control the regiochemistry of the next step, a blocking group is introduced. Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4) places a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) at the para position, which is sterically favored, yielding **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **Nitration:** The ring is now nitrated (HNO3/H2SO4). The tert-butyl group directs ortho (since para is blocked), and the sulfonic acid group directs meta. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (ortho to the tert-butyl group), giving **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Desulfonation (Removal of Blocking Group):** The sulfonic acid group is removed by heating with dilute sulfuric acid, yielding **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene** (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene). This blocking/deblocking sequence is a standard method to obtain the ortho isomer in high yield, which is normally the minor product of direct nitration.\n5.  **Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine using a reducing agent like iron in hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl), producing **o-tert-butylaniline** (2-tert-butylaniline).\n6.  **Second Nitration:** This is a crucial and non-obvious step. Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline, under carefully controlled conditions, can yield **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. While the amino group is a strong ortho/para director (favoring positions 4 and 6), and the tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director (favoring positions 3 and 5), a combination of steric hindrance at position 3 and reaction control allows for the formation of the desired 3-nitro isomer.\n7.  **Diazotization:** The amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+) using sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid (NaNO2/HCl).\n8.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol by heating with an aqueous acidic solution (H3O+), forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** Finally, the phenol is converted to the target ethoxy ether by reaction with a base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and an ethylating agent like ethyl bromide (EtBr). This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Analysis of the Given Options\n\nNone of the provided options perfectly match this correct, multi-step synthesis. They appear to be scrambled or contain chemically incorrect steps. However, we must choose the best possible option. Option A contains almost all the necessary reaction types, even if they are in the wrong order. Let's analyze it as written:\n\n**Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n\n*   **Steps i-iii:** `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene -> p-tert-Butylnitrobenzene -> p-tert-Butylaniline`. This initial sequence is chemically sound but leads to the para isomer, which does not result in the correct final product via simple subsequent steps.\n*   **Step iv:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. This gives a different isomer, not the required precursor.\n*   **Steps v-vii:** `Diazotization -> Hydrolysis -> Etherification`. This sequence correctly converts an aniline to an ethoxy group.\n*   **Steps viii-ix:** `Sulfonation -> Desulfonation`. These steps are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and strongly indicate the option is scrambled.\n\nDespite its flaws, Option A is the only one that presents the core sequence `Reduction (iii) -> Nitration (iv) -> Diazotization (v) -> Hydrolysis (vi) -> Etherification (vii)` in the correct relative order needed to transform an initial nitro compound into the final product, following the logic derived from the literature. This suggests that Option A, while poorly constructed, is the intended answer, assuming a non-high-yield synthesis of the necessary *ortho* intermediate at the beginning.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3-arrangement. Let's analyze their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring, especially with this combination of directors, is complex and requires careful planning of the reaction order.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Final Step**\n\nThe final product could be formed by adding one of the three groups last.\n*   **Adding -NO2 last (Nitration):** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. The -OEt group (strong o,p-director) would direct nitration to positions 4 and 6. The -tBu group (weak o,p-director) directs to positions 3 and 5. The powerful -OEt group would dominate, leading to products nitrated at position 4 (para) and 6 (ortho), not position 3. This route is unlikely to be high-yield.\n*   **Adding -tBu last (Alkylation):** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Both -OEt (o,p) and -NO2 (m) direct incoming electrophiles to positions 2, 4, and 6. The bulky -tBu group would likely add at position 6 or 4 to minimize steric hindrance, making the desired substitution at the crowded position 2 a minor product. This route is also unlikely to be high-yield.\n*   **Adding -OEt last (Etherification):** The precursor would be 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This would involve a standard Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH, then EtBr), which is generally a high-yield reaction. This suggests that forming the phenol is the key challenge.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Provided Options**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option. Often in such problems, there might be a typo in the question (e.g., the target molecule's name). A robust and chemically sound sequence is a strong indicator of the correct answer, even if the final product doesn't perfectly match a potentially erroneous name.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    i.   `Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3` -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    ii.  `Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)` -> The bulky -tBu group directs para. -> **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (major product).\n    iii. `Reduction (Fe/HCl)` -> **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv.  `Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)`: To control the reaction, the amine is typically protected as an acetanilide (-NHCOCH3). The -NHCOCH3 group (at position 1) and the -tBu group (at position 4) are both o,p-directors. They cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 2. -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    v.   `Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl)` -> Forms the corresponding diazonium salt.\n    vi.  `Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat)` -> Converts the diazonium salt to a phenol. -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n    vii. `Etherification (NaOH/EtBr)` -> **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    \n    This sequence is chemically sound and each step is logical and typically high-yield. However, it produces a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, not the 1,2,3-isomer specified in the name. Given the difficulty of synthesizing the 1,2,3-isomer and the clean logic of this path, it is highly probable that the target molecule's name in the question contains a typo and this is the intended answer. The remaining steps (viii, ix) are placed nonsensically at the end and are likely extraneous distractors.\n\n*   **Option B & D:** These sequences contain chemically nonsensical steps. For example, in B, step (iv) attempts to diazotize a molecule without an amine group. In D, step (vi) attempts to nitrate an unstable diazonium salt. These options are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence starts with `Nitration -> Reduction -> Alkylation`. Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline with AlCl3 forms the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director, leading to **3-tert-butylaniline**. Subsequent steps would lead to different isomers, none of which are the target, and the key nitration step would have poor regioselectivity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence A describes a logical, multi-step synthesis that is consistent with the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution and functional group interconversion. It leads cleanly to a specific isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene). The other options are either chemically flawed or would not produce a single major product. The most reasonable conclusion is that the question intended this 1,2,4-isomer as the target, making sequence A the correct choice.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the correct reaction sequence to synthesize a specific molecule.\n# I will analyze each option step-by-step to determine its chemical validity and the final product.\n\n# Analysis of Option A:\n# i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene\n# ii) Nitration -> p-tert-butylnitrobenzene (major product)\n# iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> p-tert-butylaniline\n# iv) Nitration (with protection) -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline (directing groups agree)\n# v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) -> Diazonium salt\n# vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+/Heat) -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol\n# vii) Etherification (NaOH/EtBr) -> 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene\n# This sequence is chemically sound and high-yield, although it produces an isomer of the named target.\n# It is the most plausible sequence among the choices, suggesting a typo in the problem's target name.\n\n# Analysis of Option B:\n# Step iv) NaNO2/HCl is for diazotizing an amine, but the substrate from step iii) is a sulfonic acid.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Relative Positions:** The groups are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern. This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nTo achieve a high-yield synthesis, the directing effects of the substituents must be carefully controlled, often using activating/deactivating properties and blocking groups.\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Moderately activating, ortho/para director. Very bulky, so it often directs to the para position.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino):** Strongly activating, ortho/para director. (Common intermediate).\n*   **-SO3H (Sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta director. Crucially, it's a reversible group (can be removed with dilute acid and heat), making it an excellent **blocking group**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe goal is to find a sequence that logically and efficiently places the three groups in the correct 1,2,3 orientation. Synthesizing such a crowded molecule often requires a blocking group strategy to force substituents into positions they would not normally occupy.\n\nLet's analyze the beginning of each sequence, as this is the most critical part for setting up the regiochemistry.\n\n*   **Sequence A:**\n    *   i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → The Lewis acid AlCl3 complexes with the -NH2 group, converting it into a deactivating, meta-directing group (-NH2+-AlCl3). This correctly yields **3-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) Nitration of 3-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 group (activating, o,p director) and -tBu group (activating, o,p director) cooperatively direct to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 is highly sterically hindered. The major products would be 4-nitro and 6-nitro isomers, not the required 2-nitro isomer. This path fails to provide a high yield.\n\n*   **Sequence B:**\n    *   i) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → The bulky t-butyl group strongly directs nitration to the para position, yielding mainly **4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   iii) 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → The ring is deactivated, but both groups direct to position 2 (ortho to t-Bu, meta to NO2), yielding **4-nitro-2-sulfo-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   iv) + NaNO2/HCl → This reagent is for diazotizing an amine (-NH2). The current molecule has a nitro group (-NO2). This step is chemically impossible. The sequence fails.\n\n*   **Sequence C:**\n    *   The sequence of reagents seems illogical. For instance, sulfonation (viii) and desulfonation (ix) are placed near the end, after several other transformations have occurred, which makes no strategic sense for a blocking group. The entire sequence is out of order.\n\n*   **Sequence D:**\n    *   i) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → The bulky t-butyl group directs sulfonation to the less hindered para position. This forms **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic blocking group strategy, protecting the para position.\n    *   iii) 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → Now we nitrate. The -tBu group is an o,p director, and the -SO3H group is a meta director.\n        *   -tBu (at pos 1) directs to positions 2 and 6.\n        *   -SO3H (at pos 4) directs to positions 2 and 6.\n        *   Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 2 (or 6, which is equivalent). This yields **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield. This intermediate correctly establishes the required ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups.\n    *   iv) + Fe/HCl → The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   v) + NaNO2/HCl → The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    *   The subsequent steps (vi-ix) are listed in a confusing or incorrect order, likely due to typos in the question. However, the initial steps (i-iii) represent the most logical and effective strategy among all options for creating the necessary 1,2-disubstituted pattern (t-Bu and NO2 ortho to each other) by using a sulfonic acid blocking group. No other option presents a viable high-yield path. Despite the apparent errors in the later steps, the core strategy of Sequence D is the most sound. It establishes the critical ortho relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups, which is essential for forming the final product. The subsequent steps would involve replacing the sulfonic acid and the diazonium group with the required ethoxy group and then re-introducing a nitro group in the correct location, or a similar series of transformations. The beginning of sequence D is the only one that correctly sets up the key structural feature.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence D outlines the most plausible synthetic strategy, especially in its initial steps, which employ a blocking group to correctly establish the ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and a future nitro group. While the full sequence as written has errors, its strategic foundation is superior to the other options, which contain more fundamental chemical impossibilities or low-yield steps early on.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe user wants to identify the correct multi-step synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure**: The target molecule is a benzene ring with three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: The numbering indicates a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Director Effects of Substituents**:\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene**: This is a standard electrophilic nitration.\nii) **Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline**: This is the standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\niii) **Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → 2-tert-butylaniline**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. While this reaction is problematic on aniline (the Lewis acid catalyst complexes with the basic amine) and the major product would be the *para* isomer due to steric hindrance, the formation of the required *ortho* isomer is theoretically possible, even if in low yield.\niv) **2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**: This is a nitration step. In the strong acid medium, the amine (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -NH3+ group at C1 directs the incoming nitro group to C3. The bulky tert-butyl group at C2 would also favor substitution away from it. This step correctly places the nitro group at the desired C3 position.\nv) **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylbenzenediazonium salt**: This is a standard diazotization reaction of the primary amine.\nvi) & vii) **SO3/H2SO4** and **dilute H2SO4**: These steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are superfluous and don't contribute to the main synthetic pathway. They are likely included as distractors.\nviii) **Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**: The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) upon heating in aqueous acid. This correctly places the -OH group at C1.\nix) **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide ion attacks ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ethoxy ether product.\n\n**Conclusion for A**: Despite potential low yields in steps (iii) and (iv) and the presence of extraneous steps (vi, vii), this sequence is the only one that logically leads to the correct 1,2,3-substitution pattern of the target molecule.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) **tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**: The tert-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but due to its large size, the *para* product is heavily favored.\nThis pathway will lead to a 1,4-disubstituted intermediate, making it impossible to achieve the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted final product. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nThe order of reactions is synthetically incorrect. For instance, step (iv) calls for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) on the product from step (iii), which is a sulfonic acid derivative. Diazotization requires a primary amino group, which is not present at that stage. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence is also synthetically flawed. For example, step (v) calls for diazotization on a molecule that has no amino group. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Final Verdict**\nOption A is the only chemically plausible route among the choices provided. Although the question mentions \"high-yield,\" which might not be accurate for all steps, it represents the correct logical progression of reactions to achieve the desired isomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nAn evaluation of the reaction sequences is necessary to determine the one that results in the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern (ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro), which is sterically crowded and requires a carefully planned synthetic route.\n\n### Analysis of the Synthetic Options:\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence attempts to use a sulfonic acid group as a directing group.\n    1.  `i)` Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  `ii)` Sulfonation blocks the para position, yielding 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.\n    3.  `iii)` Nitration occurs ortho to the tert-butyl group, giving 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    4.  `iv)` Reduction of the nitro group gives 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.\n    5.  `v)` Diazotization converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  `vi)` The addition of `HNO3/H2SO4` to a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical synthetic step, making this pathway incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence has a fatal flaw in its ordering. Step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) is attempted before step `viii) Fe/HCl` (reduction of a nitro group to an amine). Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine, which has not yet been formed. Therefore, this sequence is impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins by forming aniline, then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on rings with strongly deactivating groups, and the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) would react with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and directing substitution to the meta position. This would lead to the wrong isomer and is an invalid step.\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene occurs. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the para product is major, but the ortho product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is also formed. While this step may not be high-yield for the ortho isomer, the sequence proceeds with this intermediate.\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: This step involves the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is a very strong ortho, para-director. The para position is already occupied by the bulky tert-butyl group. Of the two available ortho positions (3 and 6), position 6 is sterically hindered by the adjacent tert-butyl group. Therefore, the incoming nitro group is directed to position 3, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a known regioselective reaction.\n    5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt via diazotization.\n    6.  `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, which forms **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis. The NaOH deprotonates the hydroxyl group, and the resulting phenoxide ion reacts with ethyl bromide to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe sequence of steps `i` through `vii` in option B correctly describes a valid, albeit potentially low-yield in one step, synthesis of the target molecule. The final two steps, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are extraneous and would perform a sulfonation and then a desulfonation on the final product, which serves no purpose. Their inclusion is likely an error in the question's option listing. However, compared to the other options which contain chemically impossible or incorrect steps, the core synthetic route of Option B is the only one that logically leads to the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nAnswering this question requires a deep understanding of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, including the directing effects of various substituents, the use of blocking groups, and functional group interconversions. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a polysubstituted benzene with a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The ethoxy (-OEt) group is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   The tert-butyl (-tBu) group is an activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, sterically hindering adjacent positions.\n*   The nitro (-NO2) group is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern, which is often challenging to achieve directly due to conflicting directing effects.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These sequences contain fundamental flaws.\n    *   **Option C** fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline (from step ii) is not effective. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group to form a positively charged anilinium-type complex, which strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the reaction.\n    *   **Option B** fails at step (iv). It attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (NaNO₂/HCl) on 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂), which is not present at this stage.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is chemically logical, but it produces the wrong isomer.\n    1.  **Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **tert-Butylbenzene → p-tert-Butylnitrobenzene:** Nitration. The para product is major due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group.\n    3.  **p-tert-Butylnitrobenzene → p-tert-Butylaniline:** Reduction of the nitro group.\n    4.  **p-tert-Butylaniline → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitroaniline:** Nitration. The amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. Both the -tBu (o,p) and -NH₃⁺ (m) groups direct nitration to the position ortho to the t-butyl group.\n    5.  **Diazotization →** Converts the -NH₂ group into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    6.  **Hydrolysis (H₃O⁺/Heat) →** Replaces the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to give 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.\n    7.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) →** Converts the -OH group to an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n    The final product of this sequence is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. This is the 1,2,4-isomer, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is the most complex and contains a step that appears chemically incorrect as written, but it is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze its strategy.\n    1.  **Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts.\n    2.  **tert-Butylbenzene → p-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** Sulfonation. The -SO₃H group acts as a blocking group, occupying the para position which is sterically favored for substitution.\n    3.  **Nitration → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** With the para position blocked, nitration is directed by the o,p-directing t-butyl group to the open ortho position.\n    4.  **Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine.\n    5.  **Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) →** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    \n    At this point, we have established a 1,2,4 relationship between the t-butyl, diazonium, and sulfonic acid groups. The subsequent steps (vi-ix) must transform this into the final 1,2,3 product. Step (vi), nitration of a heavily deactivated diazonium salt, is highly problematic and likely a typo. However, the overall strategy involving blocking the para position, introducing groups ortho, and then using a series of transformations (reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, desulfonation, etherification) is a powerful and necessary approach for synthesizing highly substituted, sterically hindered molecules like the target. By eliminating options B, C, and D based on more definitive flaws (failed reaction or wrong product), option A remains the only plausible, albeit imperfect, choice. It is the only sequence that attempts the kind of complex maneuvering required for such a synthesis.\n\nTherefore, despite a likely error in the description of step (vi), the overall synthetic plan outlined in Option A is the most likely to be the intended correct answer for achieving the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's dissect its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relative positions of the substituents are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with the bulky tert-butyl group flanked by two other groups, suggests a complex synthesis is required, likely involving careful control of directing effects, possibly with blocking groups.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of the groups (or their precursors) in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, ortho/para-director. Bulky, so it strongly favors the para position.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Precursor to -OEt. Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Precursor to -OH (via diazotization). Very strongly activating, ortho/para-director. In strong acid, it becomes **-NH3+**, which is deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Deactivating, meta-director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze the provided options. Many of the sequences as written contain chemically incorrect ordering of steps (e.g., diazotization before forming an amine). We must identify the most plausible intended chemical pathway. We will analyze the sequence in option D, which is the most coherent series of reaction *types*, assuming potential typos in the exact ordering.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThe listed reagents suggest a specific strategy. Let's trace the reaction step-by-step, assuming we start with the major product at each stage to ensure a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Product: **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-Butylbenzene**: This is nitration. The -tBu group is an ortho, para-director, but due to its large steric bulk, the major product is overwhelmingly the para isomer.\n    *   Major Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**: This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Product: **p-tert-butylaniline** (4-tert-butylaniline).\n\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on p-tert-butylaniline**: This is another nitration step. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   We are nitrating the **p-tert-butyl anilinium ion**.\n    *   The -NH3+ group is a deactivating meta-director. It directs incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5 (meta to itself).\n    *   The -tBu group is an activating ortho, para-director. It directs to positions 2 and 6 (ortho to itself).\n    *   The positions ortho to the -tBu group (2 and 6) are also meta to the -NH3+ group. Therefore, the directing effects of both groups reinforce each other, guiding the incoming nitro group (NO2+) to position 2 (or 6, which is equivalent).\n    *   Product: **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**: This is the diazotization of the primary amino group.\n    *   Product: **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: This reaction involves heating the diazonium salt in an aqueous acidic solution, which hydrolyzes it to a phenol.\n    *   Product: **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol to form a phenoxide ion, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack the ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether.\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**: These final two steps as listed are chemically illogical. Sulfonating a finished product and then immediately removing the sulfonic acid group (desulfonation) would be redundant and inefficient. This suggests a likely typo in the option's construction.\n\n**Conclusion of the Analysis**\n\nThe logical sequence of reactions (i through vii) in option D leads to the synthesis of **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. Let's compare this with the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Product of sequence D**: Substituents at C1(-OEt), C2(-NO2), C4(-tBu).\n*   **Target Molecule**: Substituents at C1(-OEt), C2(-tBu), C3(-NO2).\n\nThese are different constitutional isomers. However, when comparing the four options, options A, B, and C contain more severe logical flaws in the ordering of fundamental reactions (e.g., attempting diazotization before reduction to an amine). The sequence of reaction *types* in option D (alkylation, nitration, reduction, further substitution, functional group conversion) is the most plausible and represents a valid, coherent synthesis of a complex trisubstituted benzene, despite yielding an isomer of the named target. In the context of a multiple-choice question that is likely flawed, option D represents the \"best\" and most chemically sound synthetic plan among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy group) at position 1. This is a strong activating group and an *ortho, para* director.\n    *   -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl group) at position 2. This is a weak activating group and an *ortho, para* director.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro group) at position 3. This is a strong deactivating group and a *meta* director.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,2,3, which is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   Relative positions:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires careful control of directing effects, possibly using blocking groups or functional group interconversions. The presence of reagents like `NaNO2/HCl` in the options strongly suggests that a diazotization reaction of an amine is involved. The amine (-NH2) is often derived from the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2). The final ethoxy group (-OEt) is typically formed by Williamson ether synthesis from a phenol (-OH).\n\n**3. Analyze the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on standard principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n    *   Step iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. This reaction does not work as intended. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-). This complex is strongly deactivating and a *meta* director, leading to the wrong product isomer and low yields. Thus, **Option D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   This sequence contains several inconsistencies. For example, step (viii) is a reduction (Fe/HCl), but the likely intermediate before this step (based on the preceding reagents like `NaOH/EtBr`) would be an ether, which has no nitro group to be reduced at this stage. Also, having a reduction followed immediately by a nitration is unusual. The sequence of reagents is not logical. Thus, **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This sequence attempts to use sulfonation as a blocking strategy.\n    *   i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Sulfonation -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocks the *para* position).\n    *   iii) Nitration -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This correctly establishes an *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and a nitro group.\n    *   iv) Reduction -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   v) Diazotization -> [2-sulfo-4-tert-butyl-phenyldiazonium salt].\n    *   vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`. This step is problematic. Applying nitrating acid to a diazonium salt is not a standard synthetic transformation. This step makes the entire sequence chemically invalid as written. Thus, **Option C is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   Let's trace this path carefully. This sequence is long but follows a logical progression of functional group transformations.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the bulky t-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. This is a high-yield reaction.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. Direct nitration of anilines is problematic (oxidation). The standard procedure involves protecting the amine as an acetamide (-NHCOCH3), performing the nitration, and then deprotecting. Assuming this is done, the strong *ortho, para*-directing acetamido group will direct the nitro group to its *ortho* position (position 2). This yields **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group to form the **[4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenyldiazonium] salt**.\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **viii) SO3/H2SO4** and **ix) dilute H2SO4**: This is a sulfonation followed by a desulfonation.\n\n    **Evaluation of Option B:** The sequence of steps (i) through (vii) is a chemically sound and high-yield synthesis for the specific isomer **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is not the target molecule named in the question. However, Options A, C, and D contain fundamentally incorrect chemical steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a valid synthesis. The final two steps (viii, ix) are often used to isomerize a compound to its most thermodynamically stable form. While it is highly unlikely that this process would convert the 1,2,4-isomer into the more sterically hindered 1,2,3-target isomer, Option B is the only one that is not outright incorrect from a chemical reaction standpoint. Given the likely flaws in the question (either the target name or the options), Option B represents the \"best\" and most chemically plausible synthetic route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThis problem requires us to identify the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. We must evaluate each proposed synthetic pathway based on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution and functional group transformations.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe target product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It is a tri-substituted benzene ring with the substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Weakly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. Its large size sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options\n\n**Option A:**\n1.  `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n2.  `ii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n3.  `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction **fails** when attempted on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired alkylation.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis option attempts to use a blocking group strategy.\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  `ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The sulfonic acid group will add to the *para* position, forming 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n3.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration occurs *ortho* to the t-Bu group, yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This creates a 1,2,4-substitution pattern. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern. This route will not produce the correct isomer. Furthermore, step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is not a standard reaction for a diazonium salt.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitrates tert-butylbenzene.\n3.  `iii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonates the product from step ii.\n4.  `iv) NaNO2/HCl`: This is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate at this point does not have an amino group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\nThis sequence is the only remaining possibility. Let's verify its chemical logic.\n1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Alkylation of benzene gives **tert-butylbenzene**. Correct.\n2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. While the *para* isomer is the major product, the desired **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** is also formed and can be isolated.\n3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: Reduction of the nitro group in o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene yields **o-tert-butylaniline**. Correct.\n4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline. In the strongly acidic conditions, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an activator and *o,p*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to the C3 position. This is a highly regioselective step that yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the primary amine to form a diazonium salt. Correct.\n6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. Correct.\n7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide to form the final ether product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Correct.\nThe remaining steps (viii and ix) are superfluous, but the core synthesis (i-vii) is chemically sound and represents the only viable route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's analyze the substituents and their relative positions:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Bulky, so para-substitution is often favored over ortho.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Can be converted to -OH and other groups via a diazonium salt.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Precursor to -OEt.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nThe goal is to introduce these three groups in the correct positions. Achieving a 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging and may require multi-step strategies involving blocking groups or modification of functional groups. Let's evaluate each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction generally fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, Option A is not a viable high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence starts with tert-butylation of benzene, followed by nitration. This would primarily yield p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step (iv) is diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) (sulfonation of p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) does not have an amino group. The reduction step (Fe/HCl) is listed much later (viii). The sequence as written is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence uses a sulfonic acid group. Let's trace the likely products:\n        *   i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene.\n        *   ii) Sulfonation -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para due to sterics).\n        *   iii) Nitration -> The -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) groups both direct the incoming -NO2 to the position ortho to the -tBu group. Product: 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) of -NO2 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   At this stage, we have the -tBu group and the precursor to our -OEt group (the -NH2) in a *meta* relationship (at positions 4 and 2 respectively). The target molecule requires these groups to be *ortho*. This pathway will not lead to the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   This sequence is complex and involves many steps. Let's analyze the most logical pathway using these reagents, which may not be the strict written order, to see if the target can be formed. A common strategy for complex substitution patterns is to build a core structure and then use blocking groups to direct the final substitution.\n    *   **Part 1: Building the 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene core.**\n        1.  `i) Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)-->` tert-butylbenzene.\n        2.  `ii) tert-butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. While the para isomer is major, the ortho isomer is formed and can be separated. A high-yield synthesis might require an alternative route to this intermediate, but among the given options, this is a necessary starting point for an ortho-disubstituted product.\n        3.  `iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene --(Fe/HCl)-->` o-tert-butylaniline. The nitro group is reduced to an amine.\n        4.  The amine group can be converted into an ethoxy group:\n            *   `v) o-tert-butylaniline --(NaNO2/HCl)-->` Diazotization to form a diazonium salt.\n            *   `vi) Diazonium salt --(H3O+/Heat)-->` Hydrolysis to form 2-tert-butylphenol.\n            *   `vii) 2-tert-butylphenol --(NaOH/EtBr)-->` Williamson ether synthesis to form **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Part 2: Introducing the nitro group at the correct position.**\n        *   We now have the correct ortho relationship between the -OEt and -tBu groups. We need to introduce a -NO2 group at position 3.\n        *   Direct nitration of 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene is problematic. Both -OEt and -tBu are o,p-directors, so they would direct nitration to positions 4 and 6, not 3.\n        *   This is where the blocking group reagents `(viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `(ix) dilute H2SO4` become crucial.\n        5.  `viii) 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene --(SO3/H2SO4)-->` Sulfonation. The most activated and sterically accessible position is C4 (para to the strong activator -OEt). This blocks position 4. Product: **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n        6.  `iv) Nitrate the blocked intermediate --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` Now, we nitrate. The available positions for substitution are 3, 5, and 6. Let's analyze the directing effects on the remaining positions:\n            *   -OEt (at C1) directs to C6.\n            *   -tBu (at C2) directs to C6.\n            *   -SO3H (at C4) directs to C6.\n            *   All groups strongly direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to position 6.\n            *   However, to form the target product, nitration must occur at position 3. Position 3 is meta to the -OEt group (electronically disfavored) but ortho to the -tBu group. While standard rules predict substitution at position 6, complex steric and electronic interactions in highly substituted rings can sometimes lead to unusual regioselectivity. Given that this is a multiple-choice question and other options are clearly flawed, this pathway represents the most strategically sound approach, assuming the desired, albeit unusual, nitration at position 3 occurs to yield **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n        7.  `ix) Desulfonation --(dilute H2SO4)-->` The final step is to remove the sulfonic acid blocking group by heating with dilute acid. This reveals the final target molecule: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the nitration in step 6 is not the outcome predicted by simple rules, the overall strategy presented by the reagents in Option D is the most chemically sophisticated and plausible for achieving the complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern. The use of a minor isomer from an early step, followed by conversion of functional groups and a blocking group strategy, is a hallmark of advanced organic synthesis. The other options contain chemically invalid steps or lead definitively to the wrong isomeric skeleton. Therefore, Option D outlines the correct sequence of reactions required.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThe initial analysis of the reaction options proved challenging, as standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) rules do not obviously lead to the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted product in high yield. Synthesizing such compounds can be complex, often requiring non-obvious strategies like blocking groups or directing group manipulation. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key precursor to this ether is likely 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol, which would be converted to the final product via a Williamson ether synthesis (using a base like NaOH and an ethylating agent like EtBr).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the provided options by tracing the intermediates, keeping in mind that one of them must represent a viable, high-yield pathway.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which produces **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** This is a nitration reaction. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A high-yield synthesis would proceed using this major product.\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene:** This reaction reduces the nitro group to an amine, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 4-tert-butylaniline:** This is the nitration of an aniline derivative. In the strongly acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a deactivating, *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an activating, *ortho, para*-director. The directing effects of the two groups are cooperative:\n    *   The -tBu group at position 1 directs ortho, to positions 2 and 6.\n    *   The -NH3+ group at position 4 directs meta, to positions 2 and 6.\n    Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (position 2). This results in the high-yield formation of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline:** This step converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt. The product is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Heating an aqueous acidic solution of a diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This forms **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to displace the bromide from ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether. The product is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, it is clear that this reaction sequence (Option D) produces an isomer of the desired product, not the target molecule 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. There seems to be an issue with all the provided options, as none follow a standard, logical pathway to the target molecule in high yield.\n\nHowever, if we are forced to choose the \"best\" option, we must re-examine the premises. Let's reconsider step (iv) of option D. Perhaps the naming of the final compound is based on the IUPAC priority of the ethoxy group, which would renumber the ring. Let's check the final product from Option D: 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. This is a 1,2,4 substitution pattern, which is different from the target's 1,2,3 pattern.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in the question's options and re-evaluate the most plausible synthetic route from scratch, which often involves a blocking group strategy that none of the options correctly represent.\n\nA plausible, though not listed, synthesis might be:\n1.  **t-Butylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  **Sulfonation:** -> 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocks the para position).\n3.  **Nitration:** -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n4.  **Reduction of Nitro:** -> 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n5.  **Removal of Sulfonic Acid Group:** (e.g., via diazotization followed by reduction with H3PO2, not straightforward) to get 3-tert-butylaniline. This is already convoluted.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, let's reconsider the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline from my initial scratchpad analysis.\n1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  Nitration -> *o*-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene (minor isomer, but let's assume it's isolated for this hypothetical path).\n3.  Reduction -> 2-tert-Butylaniline.\n4.  Nitration: If we could somehow force nitration at position 3, we would get 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n5.  Diazotization -> Diazonium salt.\n6.  Hydrolysis -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n7.  Etherification -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nThis path is also flawed due to the difficulty of the nitration step (step 4).\n\n**Conclusion based on elimination**\n\n*   Options A and B involve sulfonation steps that lead to incorrect isomers.\n*   Option C starts with nitration, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which is problematic and leads to meta-alkylation, not the required ortho-substitution.\n*   Option D provides a chemically sound sequence of reactions that proceeds via major isomers and cooperative directing effects. However, it leads to the wrong final isomer: 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene instead of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that there is an error in the question or the provided options, as none of them correctly synthesize the target compound in high yield. However, if a choice must be made, Option D represents the most logical and regiochemically controlled sequence of reactions, even though its final product is incorrectly named or is an isomer of the target. Without a viable alternative, and acknowledging the discrepancy, none of the choices are correct. If this is a multiple-choice question from a source, there may be an error in the source material itself.\n\nSince I must choose from the given options, and none perfectly match, I cannot provide a definitive correct answer. The process of elimination reveals fatal flaws in A, B, and C. Option D is the most synthetically sound pathway, but it leads to the wrong isomer.\n\nGiven the constraints, no option is correct. However, if forced to select the \"most plausible\" chemical sequence despite the incorrect final product, Option D is the strongest contender in terms of regiochemical control. This highlights a likely error in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nMy initial analysis of the reaction sequence in option C led to the incorrect isomer, 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, instead of the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. This discrepancy suggests a potential flaw in the proposed reaction pathway or an incorrect interpretation of the directing effects of the substituents under the specified conditions. Let's re-evaluate the synthesis from a different perspective, keeping the target molecule's structure—with its ortho/meta relationships—at the forefront.\n\nThe target has an ethoxy and a nitro group *meta* to each other, and a *tert*-butyl group *ortho* to both. This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is notoriously difficult to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution, which typically favors ortho/para or meta products, not a mix. This often requires a more complex strategy, sometimes involving blocking groups or rearrangement of substituent positions.\n\nLet's meticulously re-examine the sequence in Option C, which remains the most plausible choice after eliminating the other options due to clear chemical impossibilities (e.g., diazotization without an amine, Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring).\n\n**Re-evaluation of Option C:**\n\n1.  **i) `tert`-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ on benzene:** This yields `tert`-butylbenzene. This step is sound.\n2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ on `tert`-butylbenzene:** Standard nitration. The `tert`-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to significant steric hindrance, the major product is *p*-nitro-`tert`-butylbenzene, with *o*-nitro-`tert`-butylbenzene as a minor product. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, relying on a minor product is inefficient. However, let's proceed with the major product, **4-`tert`-butylnitrobenzene**.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl on 4-`tert`-butylnitrobenzene:** This reduces the nitro group to an amino group, yielding **4-`tert`-butylaniline**. This is a standard and high-yield reduction.\n4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ on 4-`tert`-butylaniline:** This is the most critical and complex step. Direct nitration of anilines is problematic; the amino group is often protected via acetylation first. Assuming the intended reaction is the nitration of protected 4-`tert`-butylaniline (N-acetyl-4-tert-butylaniline), the acetylamino group (-NHCOCH₃) is a strong ortho, para-director. The `tert`-butyl group is also an ortho, para-director. The directing effects cooperate, and nitration occurs *ortho* to the powerfully directing acetylamino group. This gives **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitroacetanilide**, which is then hydrolyzed to **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This intermediate is a known compound.\n5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl on 4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitroaniline:** This step converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, yielding **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**. This is a standard diazotization.\n6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Heating an aqueous solution of the diazonium salt replaces the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This produces **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrophenol:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The strongly basic NaOH deprotonates the phenolic -OH group, and the resulting phenoxide ion attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The product is **1-ethoxy-4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis detailed analysis confirms that the sequence in option C produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule but not the target molecule itself. The substituent positions are (1-OEt, 2-NO₂, 4-tBu) instead of the required (1-OEt, 2-tBu, 3-NO₂).\n\nGiven that options A, B, and D contain chemically flawed steps, and option C leads to an isomer, there appears to be an error in the question or the provided options. No sequence listed correctly and efficiently produces 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question where one option must be the best fit despite potential inaccuracies, let's consider if there is any alternative, albeit less common, reaction pathway that could be implied. It's highly unlikely. The regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution is fundamental, and the outcome of the sequence in C is quite clear.\n\nSince the prompt requires selecting the best option among the given choices, and options A, B, and D are definitively incorrect due to misplaced or impossible reactions, option C represents the most chemically logical (though ultimately flawed in its outcome) sequence of reactions for synthesizing a trisubstituted nitro-ethoxy-tert-butyl-benzene. It follows a common synthetic logic: introduce directing groups, perform substitutions, and then modify the functional groups (nitro reduction, diazotization, hydroxyl substitution, etherification). The error lies in the regiochemical outcome, not the logic of the steps themselves. Therefore, it is the \"least wrong\" answer.\n\nFinal conclusion based on eliminating the impossible options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThe correct sequence of reactions to achieve the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene is outlined in option A. Let's analyze the steps to understand why this sequence is the most effective.\n\nThe target molecule is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring with an ethoxy group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group. The key to this synthesis is establishing the correct relative positions of the substituents, which requires careful control of the directing effects of the groups at each stage.\n\n1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃):** The first step is the alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director for subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n    `Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene`\n\n2.  **ii) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *para* product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is typically major. However, to arrive at the 1,2,3-substituted final product, the *ortho* isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) must be carried forward. For a high-yield synthesis, this implies that the isomers are separated at this stage.\n    `tert-Butylbenzene → 1-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzene`\n\n3.  **iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group using iron in acidic medium. This transforms the nitrobenzene derivative into an aniline.\n    `1-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzene → 2-(tert-butyl)aniline`\n\n4.  **iv) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** This is the crucial step for setting up the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. In the strong acid mixture, the amino group of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The anilinium ion is a deactivating, *meta*-director, while the tert-butyl group remains an *ortho, para*-director. The directing effects of both groups now converge on the C3 and C5 positions. This allows for the successful nitration at the C3 position, which is *meta* to the anilinium group and *ortho* to the tert-butyl group.\n    `2-(tert-butyl)aniline → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline`\n\n5.  **v) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl):** The primary amino group of 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction for transforming an amino group into a variety of other functional groups.\n    `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride`\n\n6.  **vi) Hydrolysis (H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat):** The diazonium salt is gently heated in aqueous acid to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol.\n    `Diazonium salt → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`\n\n7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is first deprotonated by sodium hydroxide to form a more nucleophilic sodium phenoxide. This phenoxide then reacts with an ethyl halide (ethyl bromide) in an Sₙ2 reaction to form the final ether product.\n    `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`\n\nThe subsequent steps listed in option A, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, are superfluous as the target molecule has already been synthesized. Their inclusion does not invalidate the correctness of the preceding sequence. The other options (B, C, and D) contain chemically incorrect steps, such as attempting to form a diazonium salt without an amine or nitrating a diazonium salt directly. Therefore, option A describes the only viable synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   The ethoxy group and the tert-butyl group are *ortho* to each other.\n*   The tert-butyl group and the nitro group are *ortho* to each other.\n*   The ethoxy group and the nitro group are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. Very bulky, so it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It can be added and removed, making it an excellent blocking group.\n\n**The Synthetic Challenge:**\nThe main challenge is establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with two *ortho, para*-directing groups (-OEt, -tBu) located *ortho* to each other. Direct electrophilic substitution to create this arrangement is very difficult due to steric hindrance and directing effects. For example, nitrating 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene would add the nitro group at positions 4 or 6, not position 3. This indicates that a more complex strategy involving blocking groups or functional group interconversions is required.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration) -> Nitrobenzene\nii) Fe/HCl (Reduction) -> Aniline\niii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation): This reaction is problematic with aniline. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form anilinium (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. This leads to poor yields and incorrect regiochemistry. This option is not viable.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration) -> This gives a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product (>70%), making this a low-yield step for any synthesis requiring the *ortho* isomer.\niv) NaNO2/HCl: This reagent is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The product from step (iii) (a nitro-sulfonic acid) does not have an amino group. This step is chemically incorrect in this position. This option is flawed.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence starts similarly to C by creating a mixture of ortho/para isomers, which is not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. Following the path with the minor *ortho*-isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), subsequent reduction, nitration, diazotization, and other steps lead to 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, which is the wrong isomer.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis sequence employs a more sophisticated strategy using a blocking group. Let's analyze it step-by-step.\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** Sulfonation. The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming -SO3H group almost exclusively to the *para* position. This blocks the para position.\n*   **iii) 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, and the -SO3H group is a *m*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the t-butyl group (C2). This is a powerful strategy to force ortho-substitution.\n*   **iv) 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amino group.\n*   **v) 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → 4-tert-Butyl-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonate:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n*   **vi) ... + HNO3/H2SO4:** This step is unusual. If interpreted as nitration, it would occur on a highly deactivated ring. The most plausible interpretation in the context of creating the target is that a series of transformations begins, using the remaining reagents. Let's assume there is a specific, albeit perhaps non-obvious, sequence of reactions involving the remaining reagents that leads to the target.\n*   **vii) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This reagent cocktail replaces a diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **viii) ... + dilute H2SO4:** This is the standard condition for desulfonation (removal of the -SO3H group).\n*   **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr:** This is the Williamson ether synthesis, which converts a phenol (-OH) into an ether (-OEt).\n\nAlthough the exact sequence and regiochemical outcome of steps vi-viii are complex and may involve non-standard reactions or specific conditions, the overall strategy presented in option A is the most chemically sound. It correctly addresses the main synthetic challenge of achieving the required ortho-substitution by using a blocking group. The other options contain more fundamental and insurmountable flaws (e.g., incorrect reactions, poor yields from the start, nonsensical reagent order). Therefore, by elimination and by recognizing the superior underlying strategy, Option A is the most plausible path.\n\nFinal logic: The blocking group strategy (steps i-iii) is the only presented method that can create the t-butyl group and nitro group ortho to each other in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-ix) are a series of functional group interconversions designed to manipulate this intermediate into the final product. While the specific order might be debatable or involve complex transformations, the foundation of the synthesis in A is far superior to the other options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequences provided in the options to determine the correct path for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Directing Effects:** The relationship between the directing effects of the groups is crucial. The ethoxy group is a strong *ortho, para*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. The nitro group is a *meta*-director. Achieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern often requires a multi-step strategy involving blocking groups or manipulation of functional groups (e.g., via a Sandmeyer reaction).\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence introduces a sulfonic acid group as a blocking group, which is a good strategy. However, step (iv) reduces the nitro group to an amine (Fe/HCl), and step (vi) attempts a nitration on a diazonium salt intermediate, which is chemically unsound in this context. The sequence does not logically lead to the final product.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence begins with the nitration of benzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, this pathway is not viable for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence has a fatal flaw at step (iv). It calls for the use of NaNO₂/HCl, which is used to create a diazonium salt from a primary aromatic amine. However, the substrate at this stage, 2-(tert-butyl)-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, does not contain an amino group, making this step impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence carefully, as it represents the most plausible (though complex) synthetic route among the choices.\n    1.  **i) `tert`-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form *tert*-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of *tert*-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the *tert*-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, 1-(*tert*-butyl)-4-nitrobenzene, which allows for a high-yield separation from the minor *ortho* isomer.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-(*tert*-butyl)-4-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding 4-(*tert*-butyl)aniline.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 4-(*tert*-butyl)aniline. The amino group (-NH₂) is a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director. Since the *para* position is blocked by the *tert*-butyl group, nitration occurs at one of the equivalent *ortho* positions (C2 or C6), yielding 4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitroaniline.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The primary amino group of 4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization reaction.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by heating in aqueous acid to form a phenol, yielding 4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitrophenol.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenolic hydroxyl group is deprotonated by NaOH and then alkylated with ethyl bromide (EtBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis to form an ethoxy group. This produces 1-ethoxy-4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene.\n    8.  **viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ & ix) dilute H₂SO₄:** These final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are chemically nonsensical in this position after the target-like molecule has been synthesized and would not contribute to the formation of the desired product. It is highly probable that these steps are erroneously included in the option.\n\nHowever, when comparing the molecule synthesized through steps (i) to (vii) of option D, **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, with the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, it becomes clear they are not the same isomer. There appears to be a discrepancy between the provided options and the exact structure named in the question.\n\nGiven the common patterns in multistep synthesis problems of this nature, it is most likely that Option D describes a valid, high-yield synthesis pathway for a specific trisubstituted benzene, and it is the most chemically sound choice among the flawed alternatives, despite the final product not matching the name perfectly and the inclusion of superfluous final steps. The core of the synthesis (steps i-vii) is logical and follows established organic chemistry principles for directing group effects and functional group interconversions.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the relative positions of the substituents:\n*   The ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position 1.\n*   The tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position 2.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is at position 3.\n\nBased on this numbering:\n*   Ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2) are **ortho** to each other.\n*   tert-Butyl (2) and nitro (3) are **ortho** to each other.\n*   Ethoxy (1) and nitro (3) are **meta** to each other.\n\nA successful high-yield synthesis must install these groups in the correct positions by carefully considering their directing effects and steric hindrance.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe will evaluate each sequence of reactions:\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ...`\n    *   Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The product from step (iii) is a substituted nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, which does not have an amine group. This step is chemically incorrect in this position. Therefore, sequence A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `... ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...`\n    *   Step (ii) nitrates tert-butylbenzene, primarily at the para position. Step (iii) reduces the nitro group to an amine. Step (iv) attempts to nitrate an aniline derivative (`2-tert-butylaniline`) under strong acid conditions (`HNO3/H2SO4`). This reaction is problematic as it leads to oxidation of the amine and a mixture of products, because the amine group protonates to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. This would not be a high-yield process for the desired product. Therefore, sequence B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (product of step ii). The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amine group, deactivating the ring and preventing the alkylation. Even if the amine is protected, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work well on rings deactivated by a nitro group (from step i). Therefore, sequence D is incorrect from the start.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; ...`\n    *   This option utilizes a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a blocking group, which is a sophisticated and powerful strategy for directing substitution. Let's trace a logical pathway using the steps from this option, as the provided order has flaws (e.g., step vi nitrating a diazonium salt is illogical).\n    *   **A plausible, re-ordered synthesis using the reagents from Option C:**\n        1.  `(i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n        2.  `(ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation blocks the para position due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        3.  `(iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration occurs ortho to the t-butyl group, as this position is activated by the t-butyl group and meta to the deactivating sulfonic acid group. This gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        4.  `(iv) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        5.  `(v) NaNO2/HCl`: The amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n        6.  `(vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        7.  `(vi) HNO3/H2SO4`: Now, we nitrate this intermediate. The existing groups (-OH, -tBu, -SO3H) all cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This gives **2-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**, establishing the correct relative positions.\n        8.  `(ix) NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the hydroxyl group to an ethoxy group, giving **2-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        9.  `(viii) dilute H2SO4`: Desulfonation removes the blocking group to yield the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n    This rearranged sequence is chemically sound and would lead to a high-yield synthesis. Although the order in Option C is scrambled, it is the only option that contains all the necessary reagents for a valid synthetic pathway.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically flawed steps.

Let's analyze the substitution pattern and the nature of the substituents.\n- **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at C1: Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n- **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at C2: Weak activator, ortho/para-director, very bulky.\n- **Nitro group (-NO2)** at C3: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-pattern.\n- The ethoxy and nitro groups are meta to each other.\n- The tert-butyl group is ortho to both the ethoxy and the nitro group.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern with this specific combination of groups is challenging to achieve via direct electrophilic aromatic substitution, often requiring a more complex strategy involving blocking groups or functional group conversions that alter directing effects.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate each reaction sequence step by step. We will assume standard reaction conditions and outcomes. The key is to check if the sequence can logically lead to the desired 1,2,3-isomer in high yield.\n\n**Option B and C Analysis (Elimination):**\n- **Option B)** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\nStep (iv) is the diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) group. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which does not have an amine group. Therefore, this sequence is chemically incorrect.\n\n- **Option C)** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\nStep (i) forms nitrobenzene. Step (ii) reduces it to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. The amine group (-NH2) is a strong base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex (-NH2-AlCl3). This complex deactivates the ring and acts as a meta-director. Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on deactivated rings. Furthermore, it would lead to meta-alkylation, not the ortho relationship required. This route is very low-yield and leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n**Option D Analysis (Elimination):**\n`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\nThis sequence contains the steps for a blocking group strategy to force ortho substitution (steps i, ii, iii), which is a valid strategy. However, step (vi) suggests the nitration of a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are generally not subjected to nitration; they are unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions. This step is highly unorthodox and makes the sequence chemically unsound as written.\n\n**Option A Analysis (Detailed Walkthrough):**\nThis sequence appears to be the most chemically plausible in terms of standard functional group transformations, despite potential issues with regiochemistry.\n- **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n- **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but due to its large steric bulk, substitution at the para position is heavily favored. This yields **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** as the major product. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, we must proceed with this isomer.\n- **iii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group gives **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n- **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director.\n    - Starting with p-tert-butylanilinium (-NH3+ at C1, -tBu at C4).\n    - The -NH3+ group directs nitration to its meta positions (C3, C5).\n    - The -tBu group directs to its ortho positions (C2, C6).\n    - The positions ortho to the activating t-butyl group (C2, C6) are also meta to the deactivating -NH3+ group. Thus, substitution is strongly directed to these positions. The product is **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n- **v) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the primary amine group forms the corresponding **diazonium salt**.\n- **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n- **vii) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into an ether. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), yielding **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion of the Analysis of Option A:**\nThe sequence of reactions in option A (steps i-vii) is a logical and standard synthesis pathway. However, it unambiguously leads to the 1,2,4-substituted isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), not the requested 1,2,3-substituted isomer (2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene). The final two steps (viii, ix) involve sulfonation followed by desulfonation, which would not change the isomer and are nonsensical as placed.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThere is a high probability that the question is flawed, either in the name of the target compound or in the options provided. None of the options correctly describe a high-yield synthesis of the specified 1,2,3-isomer using standard organic reactions.\nHowever, in a multiple-choice context, one must choose the \"best\" option. Options B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or extremely inefficient steps. Option A describes a coherent, multi-step synthesis where each step is a standard, valid transformation. The only flaw is in the final regiochemistry. It is the most plausible sequence among the flawed choices, likely representing the intended answer despite the error in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Backbone**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   C1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   C3: nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Relative Positions**:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it strongly favors substitution at the para position over the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe key challenge in this synthesis is establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern, particularly the *meta* relationship between the tert-butyl group and the nitro group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option. Most organic syntheses on benzene rings involve a series of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions. The order in which these substitutions are performed is critical to obtaining the desired isomer.\n\n*   **Options starting with tert-butylation (B, C, D):**\n    *   **Step (i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation):** When benzene is alkylated with a tert-butyl group, the -tBu group is an ortho, para-director. Because of its significant steric bulk, the major product is overwhelmingly the para-substituted product, p-tert-butylbenzene. Any subsequent reactions will start from this 1,4-disubstituted intermediate (or its precursor).\n    *   **Problem:** Building a 1,2,3-trisubstituted product from a 1,4-disubstituted starting material is generally impossible without complex rearrangements or esoteric reactions not listed in the options. For example, in Option D, starting with p-tert-butylbenzene leads to p-tert-butylaniline, which upon nitration gives 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline. This leads to a final product with a 1,2,4 substitution pattern (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), not the desired 1,2,3 pattern. A similar regiochemical problem arises in options B and C. Therefore, options B, C, and D are unlikely to produce the target molecule in high yield.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    This option starts with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline.\n    *   **i) HNO3/H2SO4**: Benzene → **Nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **ii) Fe/HCl**: Nitrobenzene → **Aniline**.\n    *   **iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: This is the crucial step. Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is not straightforward. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form an anilinium complex [-NH2-AlCl3]+. This complex is strongly deactivating and, importantly, a **meta-director**. Therefore, the tert-butyl group will be directed to the meta position.\n        *   Product: **m-tert-butylaniline**. This step successfully establishes the required *meta* relationship between the future nitro group's position (C3 relative to the amine) and the tert-butyl group. However, let's reconsider the final product numbering. The final product is `2-tBu`, `1-OEt`, `3-NO2`. The aniline precursor for this must be `2-tBu-3-nitro-aniline` which is diazotized and converted to the phenol. To make this, one must start with `2-tBu-aniline`. A less common, but possible, outcome of alkylating aniline under certain conditions is ortho-alkylation. Let's assume the reaction conditions are set to produce **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   Let's follow the path from **o-tert-butylaniline** (2-tert-butylaniline), which is the necessary intermediate to achieve the final 1,2,3 pattern.\n        *   Intermediate: 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration. To avoid oxidation of the amino group and control regioselectivity, this is typically done by first protecting the amine as an acetanilide (`2-tert-butylacetanilide`). The powerful `NHAc` group directs para (to C4), while the `tBu` group directs to C3 and C5. While the para position (C4) is electronically favored by the `NHAc` group, the target requires nitration at C3. This is sterically hindered but electronically directed by the `tBu` group. A mixture of isomers is expected, but the desired **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** (after hydrolysis of the amide) is a possible product.\n    *   The remaining steps in Option A are unusually ordered. `v) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), `vi) SO3/H2SO4` (sulfonation), `vii) dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation), `viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat` (hydrolysis), `ix) NaOH/EtBr` (ether synthesis). The sulfonation/desulfonation steps (vi, vii) placed after diazotization seem illogical. A more standard application would be to use them after nitration (step iv) to separate the desired `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline` isomer from other isomers (a classic purification technique). Assuming this is the intended purpose, let's correct the order mentally.\n    *   **Corrected conceptual flow for A:**\n        1.  (i, ii, iii) Form **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n        2.  (iv) Nitrate (via acetanilide) to get a mixture containing **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n        3.  (vi, vii - reordered) Use sulfonation/desulfonation to isolate the desired isomer.\n        4.  (v) Take the pure **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** and diazotize it with `NaNO2/HCl`.\n        5.  (viii) Treat the diazonium salt with `H3O+, H2O/Heat` to hydrolyze it to the phenol: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n        6.  (ix) Use Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`) to convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the unconventional alkylation of aniline and the seemingly misplaced steps, Option A is the only sequence that provides a plausible route to establishing the crucial meta-relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups. The other options (B, C, D) start with a para-directing Friedel-Crafts reaction that leads to the wrong overall substitution pattern. Therefore, Option A represents the most viable, albeit complex and non-ideal, synthetic pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a logical analysis of each proposed pathway is necessary, paying close attention to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\nThe target molecule has the following substitution pattern:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at position 2 (ortho to the ethoxy group).\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at position 3 (meta to the ethoxy group and ortho to the tert-butyl group).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n**Option A Analysis**\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields tert-butylbenzene. This is a standard and effective first step.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, the major product is p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene, while the desired o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is the minor product. This step results in a low yield of the required intermediate.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group in o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene to an amino group, forming o-tert-butylaniline. This is a standard reduction.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to an anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivating meta-director. The tert-butyl group is a weak activating ortho, para-director. The directing effects are conflicting. However, literature confirms that nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline can produce the 3-nitro isomer.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This is a standard method to introduce a hydroxyl group.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n8.  **viii) SO3/H2SO4 & ix) dilute H2SO4**: These sulfonation and desulfonation steps are nonsensically placed at the end of the synthesis.\n\nDespite the low yield in step (ii) and potential regioselectivity issues in step (iv), the sequence of chemical transformations (i-vii) is logical. The final two steps (viii, ix) are likely an error in the question's formulation.\n\n**Other Options Analysis**\n*   **Option B**: This sequence fails at step (iii). Aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form a salt, which deactivates the ring and prevents the Friedel-Crafts alkylation from occurring.\n*   **Option C**: This sequence is illogical because it calls for diazotization (step iv) on a molecule that does not contain an amino group.\n*   **Option D**: This sequence is incorrect at step (vi). Treating a diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4) is not a standard synthetic transformation for aromatic substitution and would likely lead to decomposition.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy process of elimination, Option A is the only sequence where the proposed transformations are chemically plausible, even if some steps present yield challenges. The other options contain fundamentally flawed steps that would not work as described. Therefore, Option A represents the most viable, albeit imperfect, pathway among the choices provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nAn optimal synthesis must consider the directing effects of substituents to ensure the correct regiochemistry at each step, aiming for a high yield. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nLet's analyze the substitution pattern and directing effects:\n*   **Substituents:** -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) at C1, -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl) at C2, and -NO2 (nitro) at C3.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   Ethoxy (-OEt) is a strongly activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   tert-butyl (-tBu) is a moderately activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2) is a strongly deactivating meta-director.\n\nA key feature of the target molecule is that the activating groups (-OEt, -tBu) are ortho to each other, while one activating group (-OEt) is meta to the deactivating group (-NO2). This suggests that the nitro group was likely introduced when a meta-directing group was present on the ring. The most effective way to control the position of multiple substituents is often through the use of blocking groups, such as a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be added and later removed.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed synthetic pathways based on these principles.\n\n### Analysis of the Correct Synthetic Route:\n\nA logical high-yield synthesis for this 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene would proceed as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is alkylated with tert-butyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3. This attaches the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + (CH3)3CCl / AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director.\n\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** To control the position of the next substituent, we use a sulfonic acid group as a reversible blocking group. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, sulfonation occurs predominantly at the para position.\n    *   tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   This blocks the para position, forcing the next electrophile to add to an ortho position.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** Now, nitration is performed. We have an ortho, para-directing tert-butyl group at C4 and a meta-directing sulfonic acid group at C1. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 position. Their directing effects are cooperative, leading to a high yield of a single isomer.\n    *   4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n4.  **Reduction of the Nitro Group:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, which is a necessary precursor for introducing the hydroxyl group via diazotization.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n5.  **Diazotization:** The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    *   2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid salt.\n\n6.  **Hydrolysis to a Phenol:** The diazonium salt is gently heated in water to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group.\n    *   Diazonium salt + H2O/Heat → 4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n7.  **Desulfonation (Removal of Blocking Group):** The sulfonic acid blocking group is removed by heating in dilute acid. This is a critical step that reveals the desired meta relationship between the -OH group and the position where the t-butyl group is.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/Heat → 3-tert-butylphenol.\n\n8.  **Nitration:** The phenol is nitrated. The hydroxyl group is a powerful ortho, para-director, and the tert-butyl group is also an ortho, para-director. The -OH at C1 directs to C2, C4, C6. The t-butyl at C3 directs to C2, C4, C6. Their effects are strongly cooperative, directing the nitro group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 (ortho to -OH and ortho to -tBu) is sterically hindered and highly activated. Position 4 (para to -OH) is also strongly activated. Position 6 (ortho to -OH) is another possibility. The most probable major product will be 6-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol due to the powerful directing effect of the hydroxyl group. This leads us to the desired precursor. Let's assume the numbering starts from OH.\n    *   3-tert-butylphenol + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol. (The numbering is now C1=-OH, C3=-tBu, C6=-NO2. This is equivalent to C1=-OH, C2=-NO2, C5=-tBu, which is not our target precursor).\n\nThere seems to be a mistake in the above logical path, let's re-examine Option A, as it contains many of the key transformations.\n\n### Re-evaluation of Option A:\n\n**A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr**\n\nLet's assume there are typos in this provided sequence and try to rearrange it into the correct order based on the steps given. The correct synthesis likely involves these reagents but in a different sequence. Comparing the required steps to build the molecule with the reagents provided in the options, none of the sequences are perfectly logical or synthetically sound as written. There are misplaced steps (like Fe/HCl before nitration), redundant steps, or steps that would lead to incorrect isomers.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" option by assuming significant typographical errors in the order of reactions, one must find a path that is the most plausible. No option provides a direct, high-yield path to the target molecule as written. The complexity of the synthesis and the flaws in each option suggest the question itself may be flawed.\n\nGiven the significant issues with all provided options, it is not possible to definitively select a correct sequence of reactions that would lead to a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. All options contain fatal chemical errors in the proposed order of reactions.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis, none of the options are correct. However, if this is a multiple-choice question from a source, there might be an intended answer despite the flaws. Without a valid pathway among the choices, a definitive answer cannot be provided.\n\nLet's analyze again to see if a different interpretation can make one option work. The target is 2-tBu, 1-OEt, 3-NO2.\nIf we re-examine D:\ni) tBu -> tert-butylbenzene\nii) NO2 -> o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (let's assume ortho isomer is taken, low yield) -> 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene\niii) Fe/HCl -> 2-tert-butylaniline\n*At this point we have the 1,2 arrangement of the amino and t-butyl groups.*\niv) **HNO3/H2SO4** -> Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. Protonation of -NH2 gives -NH3+, a meta-director. -tBu is an o,p director. Directing effects are opposed. This step would give a mixture of products, likely 2-tert-butyl-4-nitroaniline and 2-tert-butyl-6-nitroaniline, not the required 3-nitro isomer.\n\nLet's check C again:\ni) HNO3 -> Nitrobenzene\nii) Fe/HCl -> Aniline\niii) tBuCl/AlCl3 -> This would produce meta-tert-butylaniline, as AlCl3 complexes with the amine, making it a meta-director. The target has the amine-derived group and the t-butyl group ortho. So this is incorrect.\n\nAll options contain incorrect steps that would either fail, give very low yields, or produce the wrong isomer. There is no correct answer among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nThe goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene with high yield. Let's analyze the substitution pattern of the target molecule and evaluate the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\n\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n*   **Positions:** These three groups are adjacent on the benzene ring in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   Ethoxy (-OEt): Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   tert-Butyl (-tBu): Activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nA successful high-yield synthesis must carefully control the order of substitution to take advantage of these directing effects. Let's evaluate the correct synthetic strategy, which should match one of the options.\n\n**Plausible Synthetic Pathway Determination:**\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Begin by adding the tert-butyl group to benzene using tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3. This forms tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director.\n    *   *Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene*\n\n2.  **Nitration:** Nitrate tert-butylbenzene using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product will be the para-substituted isomer, 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene. The ortho isomer is a minor product. For a high-yield synthesis, we proceed with the major isomer.\n    *   *tert-Butylbenzene → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene*\n\n3.  **Reduction of Nitro Group:** Reduce the nitro group to an amino group using a reducing agent like iron (Fe) in hydrochloric acid (HCl). This forms 4-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   *1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene → 4-tert-butylaniline*\n\n4.  **Second Nitration (Key Step):** This is the crucial step to establish the 1,2,3 substitution pattern. We nitrate 4-tert-butylaniline. In the strongly acidic nitrating medium (HNO3/H2SO4), the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group remains an ortho/para-director. On the 4-tert-butylaniline substrate, the meta-directing -NH3+ group (at C4) and the ortho-directing -tBu group (at C1) both direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 position. This results in the formation of 4-amino-3-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (IUPAC: 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline). This step allows for the specific placement of the nitro group adjacent to the tert-butyl group.\n    *   *4-tert-butylaniline → 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline*\n\n5.  **Diazotization:** Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt using sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) at low temperature.\n    *   *4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline → 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride*\n\n6.  **Hydrolysis to Phenol:** The diazonium salt is then hydrolyzed to a phenol by heating in an aqueous acidic solution (H3O+, H2O/Heat). This replaces the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   *Diazonium salt → 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol*\n\n7.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** Finally, the hydroxyl group of the phenol is converted to an ethoxy group. This is achieved by deprotonating the phenol with a base (like NaOH) to form a phenoxide, followed by reaction with an ethyl halide (like EtBr). This yields the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   *4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene*\n\n**Comparison with Options:**\n\nNow, let's compare this viable sequence with the given options.\n\n*   **Option A:** Uses sulfonation as a directing group, which leads to a different isomer, and has an illogical nitration step on a diazonium salt.\n*   **Option B:** Fails at step (iii) because Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on anilines due to the Lewis acid complexing with the amino group.\n*   **Option C:** Has an incorrect order of reactions, attempting to use a diazotizing agent on a molecule without an amino group.\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Correct)\n    *   ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Correct)\n    *   iii) Fe/HCl (Correct)\n    *   iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (Correct - the key step)\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl (Correct)\n    *   vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (Correct)\n    *   vii) NaOH/EtBr (Correct - forms the final product)\n\nThe first seven steps of option D perfectly match the chemically sound pathway derived above. The final two steps, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, are superfluous as the target molecule has already been synthesized. They are likely included as distractors. Among the choices provided, option D is the only one that presents a correct sequence to achieve the desired product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct sequence of reactions:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down its structure:\n    *   A benzene ring.\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n    The substituents are adjacent to each other on the ring (1, 2, 3 substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Substituents and Their Directing Effects:**\n    In Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS), the existing groups on the ring direct where the new group will go.\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, ortho, para-director. It's very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the ortho positions.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Retrosynthesis Strategy (Working Backwards):**\n    *   **Step a: Introducing the ethoxy group.** An ethoxy group is typically added via the Williamson ether synthesis. This requires a phenol (-OH group) as a precursor. The reaction is `Ar-OH + base (e.g., NaOH) -> Ar-O-`, followed by `Ar-O- + ethyl halide (e.g., EtBr) -> Ar-OEt`.\n        *   So, the immediate precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Note: When -OH is present, it gets numbering priority as the parent 'phenol', so C1 has the OH. The other groups are at C2 and C3, hence the name 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol).\n    *   **Step b: Creating the phenol group.** A phenol group is commonly made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. The sequence is `Ar-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Ar-N2+ --(H2O, heat)--> Ar-OH`.\n        *   The precursor to our phenol must be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **Step c: Synthesizing 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.** This molecule has three groups. We need to determine the order of their introduction. Let's consider the last addition.\n        *   **Option c1: Nitration.** If we nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a very strong o,p-director. However, in strong acidic conditions (like HNO3/H2SO4 for nitration), it gets protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a **meta-director**. The t-butyl group at C2 is an o,p-director.\n            *   On 2-tert-butylanilinium, the -NH3+ (at C1) directs to positions 3 and 5.\n            *   The -tBu (at C2) directs to positions 3, 5, and 1 (blocked).\n            *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to positions 3 and 5. The desired product requires nitration at position 3. This is a plausible step.\n        *   **Option c2: Alkylation.** Introducing a t-butyl group onto 3-nitroaniline. Friedel-Crafts alkylation doesn't work well on rings with deactivating groups like -NO2 or with basic groups like -NH2 (which reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst). This path is not viable.\n        *   **Option c3: Reduction.** Starting with 1-tert-butyl-2,3-dinitrobenzene and selectively reducing one nitro group. Creating 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivatives like this can be very difficult. Nitrating 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene would direct the second nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not 3.\n    *   **Conclusion from Step c:** The most likely path to 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   **Step d: Synthesizing 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is easily made by reducing the corresponding nitro compound, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. A common reagent for this is Fe/HCl or Sn/HCl.\n    *   **Step e: Synthesizing 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.** This comes from the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Nitration will produce a mixture of ortho (the desired product) and para isomers. The para isomer is usually the major product due to less steric hindrance. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, this step is not ideal, but it's a standard reaction. A blocking group strategy could be used to improve the yield of the ortho product, but let's stick to the simplest path first.\n    *   **Step f: Synthesizing tert-butylbenzene.** This is done by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Forward Synthesis and Compare with Options:**\n    Based on our retrosynthesis, the forward reaction sequence is:\n    1.  **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**  -> tert-butylbenzene\n    2.  **tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4** -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (+ para isomer)\n    3.  **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl** -> 2-tert-butylaniline\n    4.  **2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4** -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline\n    5.  **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl** -> Diazonium salt\n    6.  **Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat** -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n    7.  **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr** -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (Final Product)\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A)** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts. Friedel-Crafts on aniline is problematic as the catalyst reacts with the amine. Also, step (vi) `SO3/H2SO4` on a diazonium salt is chemically incorrect. **Option A is wrong.**\n    *   **B)** After making nitro-tert-butylbenzene, it tries to sulfonate it. The subsequent steps are illogical. **Option B is wrong.**\n    *   **C)** Let's match its steps with our derived sequence:\n        *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` - Matches step 1.\n        *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` - Matches step 2.\n        *   iii) `Fe/HCl` - Matches step 3.\n        *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` - Matches step 4.\n        *   v) `NaNO2/HCl` - Matches step 5.\n        *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` - Matches step 6.\n        *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr` - Matches step 7.\n        This sequence perfectly matches our logical synthesis. The option includes two additional, unnecessary steps (viii, ix) at the end, which are likely typos in the question. However, the core synthesis (i-vii) is the most plausible route among all choices.\n    *   **D)** It attempts a blocking group strategy (`SO3/H2SO4` at step ii) but then follows with an incorrect sequence of reactions (e.g., reducing the nitro group before removing the blocking group, and attempting to nitrate a diazonium salt). **Option D is wrong.**\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option C outlines the most chemically sound pathway to synthesize the target molecule, despite potential regioselectivity issues and two superfluous steps listed at the end. The other options contain fundamental chemical errors. Therefore, C is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern and the nature of the substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at C1: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at C2: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at C3: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* (1,2).\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* (2,3).\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* (1,3).\n\n**2. Evaluate the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nAchieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is often difficult using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the substituents can conflict. The most challenging aspect here is the *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl group (an o,p-director) and the nitro group (a m-director). A direct electrophilic attack to create this arrangement on a ring that already contains one of these groups is unlikely. For instance, nitrating tert-butylbenzene would primarily give the para product, with the ortho product as a minor isomer (not a high-yield route). Alkylating nitrobenzene with tert-butyl chloride (Friedel-Crafts) does not work because the nitro group strongly deactivates the ring.\n\nThis difficulty suggests that a more sophisticated strategy is required, likely involving a **blocking group** to control the regiochemistry. A sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is an excellent choice for a blocking group because it's bulky, a meta-director, and can be easily removed later by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Develop a Logical Synthetic Strategy (using a blocking group)**\n\nA powerful strategy to control substitution is to:\n1.  Install the alkyl group.\n2.  Use a blocking group to occupy the most reactive position (usually para).\n3.  Install the next substituent, which will now be directed to the remaining activated positions (ortho).\n\nLet's apply this:\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start by adding the tert-butyl group to benzene.\n    Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n*   **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** Add the blocking group. Due to the steric bulk of the t-Bu group, sulfonation will occur almost exclusively at the para position.\n    tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   **Step 3: Nitration.** Now, nitrate the ring. We have two directing groups:\n    *   -tBu at C1 is an o,p-director (directs to C2, C6).\n    *   -SO3H at C4 is a m-director (directs to C2, C6).\n    Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to the same positions (C2 and C6). This is a highly regioselective reaction.\n    4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n\nThis initial sequence (Alkylation → Sulfonation → Nitration) is a very logical and high-yield approach to creating a specific trisubstituted benzene intermediate.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's examine which of the given options follows this logical start.\n*   **A)** i) tBu-Cl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4... The order is incorrect.\n*   **B)** i) tBu-Cl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4... The order is incorrect. It also leads to the wrong isomer and has superfluous steps.\n*   **C)** i) HNO3/H2SO4... Starts with nitration, and the subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (after reduction) is problematic. The order is incorrect.\n*   **D)** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4... This option perfectly matches the first three steps of our logical, regiocontrolled strategy.\n\n**5. Assess the Complete Sequence in Option D**\n\nWhile the first three steps of Option D are the most chemically sound approach among all choices, the entire sequence as written presents inconsistencies. The intermediate produced, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, has the t-Bu and -NO2 groups *meta* to each other. The final product requires them to be *ortho*. The subsequent steps as listed in option D do not provide a standard mechanism to alter this relative positioning.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question where options A, B, and C contain clear and fundamental errors (failed reactions, incorrect starting order for selectivity), Option D presents the most plausible *strategic thinking*, even if the problem statement (target molecule or subsequent steps) might be flawed. The use of a blocking group as shown in the initial steps of D is the key textbook method for tackling such a complex substitution pattern. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\nThe subsequent (hypothetically correct) steps would involve manipulation of the nitro and sulfonic acid groups (e.g., reduction, diazotization, substitution, desulfonation) to arrive at the final product, but the exact order is scrambled or incorrect in the provided option. Nevertheless, the foundation of the synthesis in D is superior to all other options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to identify the correct synthetic route.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Benzene.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Positions:** The substituents are on adjacent carbons, a 1,2,3-pattern.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Synthetic Strategies in the Options\nThe final ethoxy group (-OEt) is a strong ortho,para-director. It's often installed late in a synthesis via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/R-X`) from a phenol (-OH). A phenol, in turn, can be created from a primary amine (-NH2) using a Sandmeyer-like reaction (diazotization with `NaNO2/HCl` followed by hydrolysis with `H3O+`). This amine -> diazonium -> phenol -> ether sequence is a powerful tool for controlling substitution patterns and is a key feature to look for.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option by predicting the major products.\n\n#### **Option A: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n1.  **Step i):** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives `tert-butylbenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** Nitration of `tert-butylbenzene`. The t-Bu group is an ortho,para-director, but its extreme bulk heavily favors para-substitution. The major product is `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`.\n3.  **Step iv):** Diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. The molecule produced in the preceding steps does not have an amino group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence contains a chemically impossible step and is incorrect.\n\n#### **Option C: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n1.  **Step i):** Benzene → `tert-butylbenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** Sulfonation of `tert-butylbenzene`. Due to the steric hindrance of both the t-Bu and -SO3H groups, the substitution occurs at the para position, yielding `p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n3.  **Step iii):** Nitration. Now the t-Bu group directs ortho (since para is blocked) and the -SO3H group directs meta. Both direct to the position at C2. The product is `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence leads to a **1,2,4-substitution pattern**, which is the wrong isomer.\n\n#### **Option D: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n1.  **Step i):** Benzene → `tert-butylbenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** Nitration of `tert-butylbenzene` gives `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` as the major product.\n3.  **Step iii):** Reduction of the nitro group with `Fe/HCl` gives `p-tert-butylaniline`.\n4.  **Step iv):** Nitration of `p-tert-butylaniline`. In the strongly acidic nitrating conditions, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. Both the -NH3+ at C1 and the -tBu at C4 direct the incoming nitro group to the position between them (C3). The product is `3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence leads to a **1,3,4-substitution pattern**, which is the wrong isomer.\n\n#### **Option B: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tBuCl/AlCl3 ...`**\nLet's analyze the core transformations in this sequence. Although some steps have low yields in practice and the step order is listed confusingly, it is the only remaining possibility.\n1.  **Step i):** `HNO3/H2SO4` on benzene → `Nitrobenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** `Fe/HCl` on `Nitrobenzene` → `Aniline`. This correctly creates the amine handle for further transformations.\n3.  **Step iii):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on `Aniline`. While Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline is problematic, let's assume the question intends for it to work. To get the final product, the t-Bu group must be installed ortho to the amine, giving `o-tert-butylaniline`. This is the only way presented in the options to create the necessary 1,2-arrangement of the nitrogen and t-butyl groups.\n4.  **Step iv):** `HNO3/H2SO4` on `o-tert-butylaniline`. In strong acid, we get the o-tert-butylanilinium ion. The -NH3+ (meta-director) and the -tBu (ortho,para-director) have competing effects. However, substitution at C3 is a possible outcome and is the only one that leads to the required 1,2,3-pattern, forming `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`.\n5.  **Step v):** `NaNO2/HCl` converts the amine into a diazonium salt.\n6.  **Step viii):** `H3O+, H2O/Heat` hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`.\n7.  **Step ix):** `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) converts the phenol into the ethoxy ether, yielding the final target product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Despite some steps being non-ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, this is the only option that presents a plausible chemical pathway to the correct isomer. The other options are definitively wrong as they lead to incorrect isomers or involve impossible reactions.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must evaluate the chemical feasibility and regioselectivity of each proposed route.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule and Strategy\n\nThe target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. This arrangement is sterically crowded, and its high-yield synthesis requires careful control over the directing effects of substituents. A simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work due to the formation of undesired isomers. The presence of reagents for sulfonation (`SO₃/H₂SO₄`) and subsequent desulfonation (`dilute H₂SO₄`) strongly suggests that a **blocking group strategy** is required. The sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is used to temporarily occupy a position (usually the para position) to force subsequent substituents into other desired locations, and is then removed later in the sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **Option A**: This sequence fails early on. Step (ii) would nitrate tert-butylbenzene primarily at the *para* position, not leading to the 1,2,3-pattern. Furthermore, step (iv) `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization) is performed without an amine functional group being present, which is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B**: This sequence starts by making aniline (`i` and `ii`). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic lone pair on the amine, deactivating the ring towards alkylation.\n\n*   **Option D**: This sequence also fails on regioselectivity. Step (ii) involves the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director that heavily favors substitution at the sterically unhindered *para* position. This leads to 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene as the major product, which cannot be converted into the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted final product.\n\n*   **Option C**: This sequence presents the only viable strategy using a blocking group.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: This correctly performs a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on benzene to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄**: This step introduces a sulfonic acid (-SO₃H) group at the *para* position of tert-butylbenzene, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This effectively **blocks** the para position from further substitution.\n    3.  **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: With the para position blocked, nitration is forced to occur at an *ortho* position relative to the t-butyl group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is the crucial step that establishes the 1,2 relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to a primary amine, forming **4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    5.  **Remaining steps (v-ix)**: The remaining reagents are used to install the final nitro and ethoxy groups and remove the blocking group. Although the order listed might seem slightly confusing, the reagents are correct for the necessary transformations: diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), conversion to a phenol (`H₃O⁺/Heat`), introduction of the final nitro group (`HNO₃/H₂SO₄`), removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group (`dilute H₂SO₄`), and finally, Williamson ether synthesis to form the ethoxy group (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n\nBy a process of elimination and by recognizing the necessary blocking group strategy, Option C is the only chemically sound choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nI have analyzed the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern on the benzene ring. I will evaluate each option to determine the most viable high-yield pathway.\n\n**Analysis of the Target Molecule and Substituent Effects:**\n*   **Target:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, *ortho, para*-director, very bulky.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Positional Relationships:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nA successful high-yield synthesis must carefully control the sequence of reactions to use the directing effects of the substituents to install the new groups in the desired positions.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene would primarily yield the *para* product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group.\n    iii) If we proceed with the major *para* product, sulfonation would occur at the position ortho to the tert-butyl group, leading to an incorrect substitution pattern.\n    iv) The sequence proceeds to a diazotization step (NaNO2/HCl), but there is no primary amine present to react. This makes the sequence chemically impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    This option includes steps for using a sulfonic acid blocking group (ii, viii), which is a valid strategy for directing substitution. However, the order of the reactions as listed is illogical. For example, it performs a reduction (iv), followed by diazotization (v), and then attempts another nitration (vi). This sequence is not chemically sound. While the list of reagents might be useful in a different order, the sequence as presented is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.\n    iii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the nitrogen atom of the amino group is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack. Therefore, this option is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step, assuming it aims for a high-yield process by taking the major product at each stage.\n    i) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.** A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    ii) **tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives the *para* product as the major isomer due to the large steric hindrance of the tert-butyl group, which disfavors *ortho* substitution. This step is high-yield.\n    iii) **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butylaniline.** Reduction of the nitro group to a primary amine.\n    iv) **4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline.** The powerful activating, *ortho, para*-directing amino group (-NH2) directs the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to itself (position 2).\n    v) **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.** The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    vi) **Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n    vii) **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ethoxy ether.\n\nThe final product of this logical sequence is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is an *isomer* of the target molecule. The remaining steps, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, would not cause the necessary skeletal rearrangement to form the desired product. Given that options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible or illogical steps, option D describes the only chemically coherent multi-step synthesis, albeit for an isomer of the target compound. This suggests a likely error in the problem statement's target molecule name. Assuming the question intended to ask for the synthesis of the isomer produced by this logical pathway, this is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe problem asks to identify the sequence of reactions that would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and work backward (retrosynthesis) and then evaluate the given options.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nThe substituents are:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relationships are: -OEt is *ortho* to -tBu and *meta* to -NO2. The -tBu is *ortho* to both -OEt and -NO2.\n\n**Analysis of the final steps:**\nThe final product is an ether. A very common method for synthesizing aryl ethers is the Williamson ether synthesis, which involves reacting a phenoxide with an alkyl halide. The reagent `NaOH/EtBr` (step vii in option B) is characteristic of this reaction. This implies the immediate precursor is a phenol: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\nHow is this phenol synthesized? A common route to phenols is through the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, which is in turn made from an aniline. The reagents `NaNO2/HCl` followed by `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (steps v and vi in option B) correspond to this transformation. This suggests the precursor to the phenol is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\nNow, the central chemical puzzle is how to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline with the correct regiochemistry. The -NH2 and -NO2 groups are *meta* to each other, while the -tBu group is *ortho* to both. This specific arrangement can be achieved by following a specific sequence of reactions that control the directing effects of the substituents.\n\nLet's evaluate the sequence proposed in Option B, which aligns with our retrosynthetic analysis.\n\n**Evaluation of Option B:**\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation which installs the tert-butyl group, forming *tert-butylbenzene*. This is a logical first step.\n\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** This is electrophilic aromatic nitration. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. However, due to its large steric bulk, nitration heavily favors the *para* position (forming 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) over the *ortho* position (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene). While the yield of the *ortho* isomer is lower, it is the necessary intermediate for the desired final product. We must proceed with this *ortho* product.\n\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** This is a standard and high-yield reduction of a nitro group to an amino group, producing *2-tert-butylaniline*.\n\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 2-tert-butylaniline:** This is the key step for establishing the correct regiochemistry. Under the strongly acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. Although the tert-butyl group is an activating *ortho, para*-director, nitration can be directed to the position *meta* to the -NH3+ group, which is position 3. This reaction is known to produce the desired *2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline*.\n\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the diazotization of the primary amino group to form a diazonium salt. This is a standard procedure.\n\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol upon heating in acidic water, yielding *2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol*.\n\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** The phenol is first deprotonated by NaOH to form the more nucleophilic phenoxide ion, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis seven-step sequence is a chemically logical and valid pathway to the target molecule. The remaining steps, (viii) and (ix) in option B, are extraneous as the final product has already been formed. The other options contain chemically flawed sequences. For instance, option C attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a nitrobenzene ring, which is highly deactivated and does not work. Option A has a nonsensical step of adding nitrating mixture to a diazonium salt.\n\nTherefore, despite the issue of yield in step (ii) and the extraneous final steps, the sequence of reactions i-vii in option B represents the most plausible and correct synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1.

Let's analyze the substitution pattern and directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at C1: Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at C2: Activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at C3: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern. This is a sterically crowded arrangement that is often challenging to synthesize directly via electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), as directing groups typically favor substitution at less hindered positions. Achieving this pattern often requires a multi-step strategy involving blocking groups or the conversion of one functional group into another after directing other substitutions.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options by Forward Synthesis**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step should proceed with good regioselectivity for the desired intermediate.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation).\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-Bu group is o,p-directing but bulky. The major product is `para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` (~70-80%), with the `ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` being a minor product. To proceed towards a 1,2,3-substituted product, we would need the ortho isomer. This low yield in an early step makes this pathway inefficient and not \"high-yield\".\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline is problematic as the Lewis acid (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. To perform this reaction, the amino group must be protected, typically as an acetanilide (-NHCOCH3). The acetamido group is a strong o,p-director. FC-alkylation of acetanilide gives predominantly the `para-tert-butylacetanilide` due to sterics. After deprotection, this yields `p-tert-butylaniline`. The t-butyl and amino groups are para, while the target requires them to be ortho (in relative positions 1 and 2). This path leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n**Option D:** This option starts with a blocking group strategy, which is often employed for controlling regiochemistry in EAS. Let's analyze it carefully.\n\n*   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene → `tert-butylbenzene`**. This is a standard, high-yield reaction.\n*   **ii) `SO3/H2SO4` on `tert-butylbenzene` → `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**. The bulky t-Bu group directs the incoming sulfonic acid group to the sterically accessible para position. This is a high-yield step.\n*   **iii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` → `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`**. Now we have two directing groups:\n    *   The t-Bu group (at C1) is an o,p-director. The para position is blocked by -SO3H, so it directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   The -SO3H group (at C4) is a meta-director. It directs to C2 and C6.\n    Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C2/C6). This leads to a high yield of the desired product, `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this molecule, the t-Bu and NO2 groups are *ortho* to each other, which is the required relative positioning for the final product.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence D provide a high-yield route to an intermediate with the correct ortho-relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups, which is a significant challenge overcome. The other options fail at this early stage to provide a high-yield path to the required substitution pattern. Although the remaining steps in option D appear scrambled (e.g., nitrating a diazonium salt), the initial sequence is the most chemically sound and strategic among all choices. In multiple-choice questions of this nature, the option with the most logical and effective initial strategy is typically the intended answer, even if there are typos in later steps. The path laid out in steps (i)-(iii) of option D is the standard and most effective way to achieve ortho-nitration of tert-butylbenzene.\n\nLet's hypothetically unscramble the rest of D to show a plausible route:\n1.  i) `t-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> t-butylbenzene\n2.  ii) `SO3/H2SO4` -> 4-t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n3.  iii) `HNO3/H2SO4` -> 4-t-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid\n4.  viii) `dilute H2SO4` (Desulfonation) -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene\n5.  iv) `Fe/HCl` (Reduction) -> 2-tert-butylaniline\n6.  `HNO3` (under special conditions, e.g., nitration of the anilinium salt) -> 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline\n7.  v) `NaNO2/HCl` (Diazotization)\n8.  vii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (Hydrolysis to phenol) -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n9.  ix) `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n\nThis long but plausible synthesis uses the reagents provided in option D. The crucial part is that the start of sequence D is the only one that correctly uses a blocking group to establish the difficult ortho-substitution pattern in high yield.\n\nTherefore, sequence D represents the most viable strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nA comprehensive analysis of the reaction options is required to determine the correct high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern (ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro), which is often challenging to achieve and typically requires a specific order of reactions, sometimes involving blocking groups.\n\nLet's analyze the steps for the most plausible synthetic route:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: The synthesis must begin by introducing the tert-butyl group onto the benzene ring. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl₃. This reaction is generally effective.\n    *   *Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-butylbenzene*\n\n2.  **Nitration**: The next step is nitration. Nitrating tert-butylbenzene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) will yield a mixture of ortho and para products. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product will be *4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene*, with *2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene* as the minor product. A high-yield synthesis must effectively utilize the major isomer.\n\n3.  **Reduction of the Nitro Group**: The nitro group of *4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene* is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂), typically using a reducing agent like iron in hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This yields *4-tert-butylaniline*.\n\n4.  **Second Nitration**: The next crucial step is another nitration. In 4-tert-butylaniline, the amino group is a powerful ortho, para-directing and activating group. It will direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to it (position 2), as the para position is blocked by the tert-butyl group. This reaction yields *4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline*.\n\n5.  **Diazotization**: The amino group of *4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline* is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻) using sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid (NaNO₂/HCl) at low temperatures.\n\n6.  **Hydrolysis to a Phenol**: The diazonium salt is then converted into a phenol by heating with water (H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat). The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming *4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol*.\n\n7.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis**: Finally, the ethoxy group is introduced. The phenol is treated with a base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form a phenoxide ion, which then reacts with an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis. This converts the hydroxyl group to an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), yielding the final product.\n\nHowever, this detailed pathway leads to the synthesis of **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, not the desired *2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene*. None of the provided options correctly map out a high-yield synthesis for the specified target molecule. The substitution pattern of the intended product requires a more complex synthetic strategy, likely involving blocking groups in a different sequence or using less common reactions that are not reflected in the standard options. For example, creating the ortho-tert-butyl-nitro arrangement is non-trivial. It appears there is a fundamental flaw in the question's options relative to the stated target product.\n\nGiven the significant discrepancy between the target molecule and the products of the reaction sequences, it is not possible to select a correct option from the list provided.\n\n<<<The provided options do not lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. This is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   The two ortho/para-directing groups (-OEt, -tBu) are ortho to each other.\n*   The strongly activating -OEt group is meta to the -NO2 group.\n*   The -tBu group is ortho to the -NO2 group.\n\nThe fact that the powerful activating group (-OEt) is meta to a group introduced by electrophilic aromatic substitution (-NO2) is a major clue. This typically happens if the nitration occurs when the precursor to the -OEt group is a meta-director. The standard way to achieve this is by nitrating an anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -NH3+ group can then be converted to an -OEt group.\n\n**2. Evaluation of Reaction Sequences:**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this strategy and general principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by making aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivating group (-NH3+) that poisons the catalyst and prevents the alkylation. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) is the formation of a diazonium salt from an amine. Step (vi) is the nitration of this intermediate. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used immediately. Attempting to perform a nitration reaction on a diazonium salt under strong acid and heat is not a viable synthetic step. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** This is a permutation of the reagents from other options, but the sequence is also flawed and does not lead to the desired product through a logical synthetic pathway. For example, step (iii) involves sulfonating o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene which would give a mixture, and step (iv) attempts to use NaNO2/HCl on the resulting sulfonic acid, which is not a standard reaction.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    Let's analyze this sequence carefully:\n    1.  `i) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3` -> `tert-butylbenzene`. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  `ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene`. This gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The bulky t-Bu group favors the formation of the para isomer (`p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`) in high yield, with the ortho isomer (`o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`) as a minor product. To match the final product's ortho relationship between the t-Bu and a NO2 group, we would have to proceed with the minor ortho isomer, which is a flaw for a \"high-yield\" synthesis but is chemically possible. Let's assume we isolate `o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`.\n    3.  `iii) Reduction of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene with Fe/HCl` -> `o-tert-butylaniline`. Standard reduction.\n    4.  `iv) Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline`. Under the strong acidic conditions of HNO3/H2SO4, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Let's analyze the directing effects on `o-tert-butylanilinium` (NH3+ at C2, tBu at C1): The -NH3+ group at C2 directs meta to C4 and C6. The -tBu group at C1 directs ortho,para to C2(blocked), C4, and C6. Both groups direct incoming electrophiles to positions 4 and 6. This would not yield the required 3-nitro isomer needed for the final product structure. *However, this is a known complex reaction, and all other options are chemically impossible*. Given that this is a multiple-choice question, and options B, C, and D are definitively wrong due to fundamental errors, A remains the only possibility, implying this path works as intended, even if it appears low-yield or complex.\n    5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr`: This is the correct and standard three-step sequence to convert the aniline intermediate into an ethoxy group.\n    6.  `viii) and ix)`: These final steps, sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are redundant on the final product and likely represent a flaw in the question's option list, but they don't invalidate the core synthetic pathway from i to vii.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy eliminating options B, C, and D which contain impossible synthetic steps, Option A remains the only plausible, albeit imperfect, choice. It outlines a sequence of known reactions that could, in principle, form the target molecule.\n\n```python\ndef solve_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided reaction sequences to identify the one that synthesizes\n    2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analysis of the Reaction Sequences:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    print(\"Target Molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\")\n    print(\"This requires a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring (OEt at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Option D Analysis:\")\n    print(\"Starts with nitration then reduction to aniline.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n*   -OEt is a strong activator and an ortho, para-director.\n*   -tBu is a weak activator and an ortho, para-director. It is very bulky.\n*   -NO2 is a strong deactivator and a meta-director.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires a careful strategy, sometimes involving blocking groups or exploiting changes in directing effects of functional groups during the synthesis.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options based on Initial Steps**\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration of benzene (i), followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (iii). Friedel-Crafts reactions on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) do not work. Even on aniline, it is problematic as the amine reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst. So, Option D is incorrect.\n*   **Options A, B, C:** All start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride (i), forming tert-butylbenzene. This is a logical first step. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director.\n\n**3. Analyze the Core Synthetic Strategy**\n\nAchieving the 1,2,3-substitution pattern directly from tert-butylbenzene is difficult. Direct substitution on tert-butylbenzene would occur at the para (C4) and ortho (C2, C6) positions. To get a group at C3, a more complex strategy is needed. A common high-yield strategy for controlling regiochemistry is the use of a blocking group, typically a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be easily added and later removed.\n\nLet's look for a sequence that employs this strategy logically.\n\n*   **Option A and C:** They introduce the nitro group (ii) right after the tert-butyl group. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mostly the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) due to the steric bulk of the t-Bu group. To obtain an ortho relationship as needed for the final product, we would have to rely on the minor ortho-nitration product, which contradicts the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n*   **Option B:** This option starts with alkylation (i) followed by sulfonation (ii). This is the hallmark of a blocking group strategy. Let's analyze this path in detail.\n\n**4. Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis of Option B (and its implied logic)**\n\nThe listed order of reagents in the options can sometimes be confusing or contain typos. The key is to see if the *set* of reagents can form a logical and high-yield pathway to the product. Option B contains a very clever, known synthesis route.\n\n**The logical (rearranged) synthesis using the reagents from Option B:**\n\n1.  **Step (i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   This is the start of the sequence.\n\n2.  **Step (ii) Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   The bulky t-Bu group directs the sulfonation to the para position, making this a high-yield step.\n\n3.  **Step (iii) Nitration:** 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   This is a critical step. Let's analyze the directing effects on 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   The -tBu group at C4 is an activator and o,p-director, directing to C3 and C5 (its ortho positions).\n        *   The -SO3H group at C1 is a deactivator and m-director, also directing to C3 and C5 (its meta positions).\n    *   Since both groups direct to the same positions (C3 and C5), this nitration is highly regioselective and high-yield.\n\n4.  **Step (iv) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine. 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → **3-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   The nitro group is reduced, which is a key step to later introduce the oxygen atom.\n\n5.  **Step (v) Diazotization:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt. 3-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → **4-tert-butyl-3-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n6.  **Step (vii) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. ...diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → **3-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n7.  **Step (viii) Desulfonation (Removal of Blocking Group):** 3-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4 → **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   Heating with dilute acid removes the sulfonic acid group. The resulting molecule, with an -OH group and a -tBu group ortho to each other, is 2-tert-butylphenol. This is a clever, high-yield synthesis of this important intermediate.\n\n8.  **Step (ix) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** 2-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   The phenol is converted to the desired ethoxy ether.\n\n9.  **Step (vi) Final Nitration:** 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This final step introduces the required nitro group. The directing effects are complex (-OEt at C1 directs to C4/C6; -tBu at C2 directs to C3/C5). However, nitration at C3, which is ortho to the bulky t-butyl group, is required. While potentially yielding a mixture, this is the final step to achieve the target structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the order of reagents listed in option B (specifically steps vi-ix) is jumbled from a linear synthesis perspective, the collection of reagents in Option B corresponds to a known, logical, and high-yield multi-step synthesis. The other options either use reactions that would fail or would not lead to the correct isomer in high yield. The core of the correct synthesis is the elegant use of a sulfonic acid blocking group to synthesize the key intermediate, 2-tert-butylphenol, which is only possible with the reagents and initial steps outlined in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break it down:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1. This is an ortho, para-directing and activating group.\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)** at position 2. This is an ortho, para-directing and activating group.\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3. This is a meta-directing and deactivating group.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern.\n*   The -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho to each other.\n*   The -tBu and -NO2 groups are ortho to each other.\n*   The -OEt and -NO2 groups are meta to each other.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring can be challenging, especially when dealing with competing directing effects. The final arrangement often requires a multi-step synthesis involving functional group transformations or the use of blocking groups.\n\n**2. Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies**\n\nLet's consider how the final arrangement might be achieved.\n\n*   **Final step is Nitration?** If we try to nitrate 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene, both the -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho, para-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. So, this is not a high-yield approach.\n\n*   **Final step is Williamson Ether Synthesis?** This would mean the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is a plausible penultimate step (`...-OH + NaOH/EtBr -> ...-OEt`). This sequence appears in the options.\n\n*   **Final step is Friedel-Crafts Alkylation?** If we try to alkylate 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the activating -OEt group (o,p-directing) would compete with the deactivating -NO2 group (m-directing). The -OEt group would direct the incoming t-butyl group to position 4 or 6, not position 2.\n\nThis analysis suggests that the OEt group is likely introduced late in the synthesis from a phenol, which itself is likely generated from an amine via a diazonium salt. This common synthetic route is:\n`-NH2 -> (NaNO2/HCl) -> -N2+ -> (H3O+) -> -OH -> (NaOH/EtBr) -> -OEt`.\nThis sequence of transformations appears in option A as steps (iii), (v), (vi), and (vii).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on chemical principles. All options list the starting material as benzene.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. Direct alkylation of aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and promoting meta-substitution, which is not the desired outcome. Therefore, this sequence is flawed.\n\n*   **Option B:** In step (iii), it sulfonates a nitro-compound, and in step (iv), it attempts diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`). Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2), but the amine formation step (`Fe/HCl`) only occurs much later at step (viii). The order of reactions is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** After forming an amine (step iv) and a diazonium salt (step v), it attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt (step vi). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; they are typically not subjected to further electrophilic aromatic substitution like nitration. This step is chemically unsound.\n\n*   **Option A:** This option remains. Let's trace its steps carefully to see if it leads to the desired product. The sequence contains a complete set of plausible reactions, including alkylation, nitration, reduction, the full aniline -> ether conversion, and a sulfonation/desulfonation pair which suggests the use of a blocking group. Although the order as written seems strange (sulfonation and desulfonation at the end), it is the only option without chemically invalid steps. Let's analyze the expected outcome from the main reaction pathway.\n\n    i)  `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: The tert-butyl group is o,p-directing. Due to steric hindrance, the major product is the para-isomer. -> **1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine. -> **4-tert-Butylaniline**.\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of an aniline. To avoid oxidation and control the reaction, the amino group is typically protected first (e.g., by acetylation to form acetanilide, -NHCOCH3). The acetamido group is a strong o,p-director. In 4-tert-butylacetanilide, both the -NHCOCH3 and -tBu groups direct to the same positions (2 and 6). Nitration will occur ortho to the stronger directing acetamido group. After hydrolysis of the protecting group, the product is -> **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n    v)  `NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. -> **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group. -> **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether. -> **1-Ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis product is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target molecule itself. There appears to be an issue with all the options or the problem statement. However, by eliminating options B, C, and D based on fundamentally incorrect chemical steps, option A is the only remaining possibility. While the straightforward interpretation of option A yields an isomer, it represents the most chemically sound sequence of *types* of reactions among the choices for a complex synthesis. It's possible a less common reaction pathway or regioselectivity is intended, or that there is an error in the question. In a multiple-choice scenario, the best approach is to eliminate the definitively incorrect options.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically invalid or incorrectly ordered reaction steps. Option A provides a sequence of plausible reactions, even though the standard regiochemical outcome does not yield the named target. By the process of elimination, A is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThe user wants to identify the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene with a high yield.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and the required steps.\n**Target Molecule**: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring with the following groups:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), an activating *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃), an activating *ortho, para*-director (but sterically bulky).\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a deactivating *meta*-director.\n\nA common final step for introducing an ethoxy group is a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This means the immediate precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This reaction involves using a base like NaOH followed by an ethylating agent like ethyl bromide (EtBr). This corresponds to step `(vii) NaOH/EtBr` in option C.\n\nThe phenol itself is often prepared from a primary aromatic amine via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. This means the precursor to the phenol would be **1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**. The reactions are treatment with `NaNO₂/HCl` followed by `H₃O⁺/Heat`. This matches steps `(v)` and `(vi)` in option C.\n\nSo, the core of the problem lies in the synthesis of **1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**. Following the sequence in option C backwards, this intermediate should be the product of step `(iv)`.\n\nLet's evaluate each option to find the most plausible route.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation fails on aniline. The lone pair of the amino group coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\nii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is bulky and directs *para*. The major product is **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\niii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Both the tert-butyl group (o,p-director) and the sulfonic acid group (m-director) direct the incoming nitro group to position 2 (relative to the sulfonic acid). The product is **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\nThis pathway creates a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, which cannot lead to the desired 1,2,3-substituted final product. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene → 4-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product).\niii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation → 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene-2-sulfonic acid.\niv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. At this stage of the synthesis, there is no amino group present. The molecule contains a nitro group and a sulfonic acid group. Therefore, this step is not possible. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nLet's analyze the sequence as written:\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. For the synthesis to proceed towards a 1,2,3-product, the minor *ortho*-isomer (**2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**) must be used. This contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim but is necessary for the sequence to have any chance of succeeding.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. 2-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene → **2-tert-Butylaniline**.\niv) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the most problematic step. Under the strongly acidic conditions, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Directing effects conflict, and the position needed for the final product (position 3) is ortho to both groups and thus extremely sterically hindered. This reaction would give a complex mixture of products with very low yield of the desired isomer.\nv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: Assuming the desired **1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene** was formed in the previous step, it would be converted to a diazonium salt.\nvi) `H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis gives the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nviii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄` ; ix) `dilute H₂SO₄`: The placement of sulfonation and desulfonation at the end of the synthesis is illogical.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible steps in their sequences. Option C outlines a sequence that, while suffering from severe yield and regioselectivity problems (especially in steps ii and iv) and having nonsensical final steps (viii, ix), is the only pathway that isn't definitively impossible from a fundamental reaction standpoint. By the process of elimination, it is the most likely intended answer, despite its significant flaws. The set of reagents in C is plausible for a complex synthesis involving blocking groups and functional group interconversions, even if they are presented in a confusing order.\n\nTherefore, despite its issues, option C represents the only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution, as well as the potential for multi-step functional group transformations.\n\n### Target Molecule Analysis\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are **ortho** to each other.\n*   tert-Butyl and nitro are **ortho** to each other.\n*   Ethoxy and nitro are **meta** to each other.\n\n### Evaluation of Synthetic Pathways\n\nA sound synthetic strategy must install these groups in the correct positions with high yield. This involves considering the activating/deactivating nature and ortho-, para-, or meta-directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n*   **-C(CH₃)₃ (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho,para-director. It is very bulky, strongly favoring substitution at the para position to minimize steric hindrance.\n*   **-OCH₂CH₃ (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH₂ (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director. Can be converted to -OH via diazotization.\n*   **-SO₃H (sulfonic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director. Crucially, it is a reversible blocking group that can be removed with dilute acid and heat.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options step-by-step.\n\n#### **Option A**\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation):** Benzene is converted to tert-butylbenzene.\nii) **HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** The tert-butyl group directs the incoming nitro group. Due to the bulkiness of the tert-butyl group, the major product is overwhelmingly the para isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. The ortho isomer, which would be needed for a 1,2,3-pattern, is formed in very low yield. This makes the overall synthesis not \"high-yield\" if it relied on the ortho isomer. However, let's follow the major product pathway.\niii) **Fe/HCl (Reduction):** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\niv) **HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** The amino group is a very strong ortho,para-director. It must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation to form acetanilide) to prevent oxidation and to moderate its reactivity. The acetamido group (-NHCOCH₃) directs ortho to itself. The tert-butyl group is at the para position. Thus, nitration occurs at the position ortho to the acetamido group, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** (after hydrolysis of the amide).\nv) **NaNO₂/HCl (Diazotization):** The amino group of 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.\nvi) **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat (Hydrolysis):** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\nvii) **NaOH/EtBr (Williamson Ether Synthesis):** The phenolic -OH group is deprotonated by NaOH and then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\nviii) **SO₃/H₂SO₄ (Sulfonation)** and **ix) dilute H₂SO₄ (Desulfonation):** These final two steps would sulfonate the ring and then remove the sulfonic acid group, making them redundant and pointless.\n\nThe product of this sequence is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target itself. The substituents are in a 1,2,4-arrangement. Therefore, this option does not lead to the desired product.\n\n#### **Option B**\ni) **HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene.\nii) **Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline.\niii) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions fail on aniline because the amino group complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. Even if the amine is protected as an acetanilide, it directs the incoming tert-butyl group to the para position. This pathway does not work.\n\n#### **Option C** and **Option D**\nBoth of these options seem to contain typos or have steps in an illogical order. For instance, in Option C, step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), but there is no amino group present at that stage. Option D has two nitration steps in a row in a way that is synthetically unviable (`v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4`).\n\n### Conclusion\nUpon rigorous examination, none of the provided options describe a correct, high-yield synthesis for **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Option A describes a plausible multi-step synthesis, but it yields the wrong isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene). Options B, C, and D contain fundamental flaws in their proposed sequences. Given the constraints of the question, there is likely a significant error in the question itself, either in the name of the target compound or in the listed steps of the options.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" synthesis among the flawed choices, the sequence in A is the most elaborate and follows a logical (though ultimately incorrect for the stated target) progression of standard organic reactions. It's plausible that the intended target was the isomer produced by pathway A, and the name was written incorrectly in the prompt.\n\nGiven the significant flaws in all options for producing the named target, a definitive correct answer cannot be determined from the choices provided. However, pathway A represents a coherent synthesis of a related isomer.\n\nAfter re-evaluating the possibility of steric hindrance guiding the tert-butylation of 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene to the C2 position, it remains a less likely pathway compared to substitution at the more electronically favored and less hindered C6 position. The most chemically sound methods for creating the ortho-ortho relationship between the substituents involve a blocking group strategy, which is not correctly represented in any of the options to produce the final target molecule.\n\nTherefore, based on a rigorous analysis, none of the options are correct. But if we must assume an error in the question and choose the most coherent synthetic sequence presented, option A is the only one that represents a viable (though long) synthesis of *an* isomer. For the purpose of selecting an answer from the given list, it's the most likely intended sequence despite leading to the wrong named product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nAn analysis of the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, reveals a specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. To achieve this arrangement with high yield, the order of reactions is critical, as each substituent influences the position of subsequent additions (directing effects).\n\nLet's break down the required synthesis strategically and then evaluate the given options.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule and Retrosynthesis\n\n*   **Target:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents and their directing effects:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-C(CH3)3):** Activating, ortho, para-director. It is a very bulky group, which has significant steric effects.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Relative positions:** The -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho to each other. The -tBu and -NO2 groups are also ortho to each other. This crowded arrangement suggests that the bulky tert-butyl group should be introduced carefully, as it might be sterically hindered from entering a position between two existing groups.\n\nA common and effective strategy in complex aromatic syntheses is the use of a **blocking group**. A sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this. It can be added to the ring via sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) to block a specific position (usually the para position) and then removed later in the synthesis via desulfonation (heating with dilute acid).\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on these principles.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **Option A & D:** These options start with (i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form tert-butylbenzene, followed by (ii) nitration. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene overwhelmingly yields the *para* isomer (*p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene), with the desired *ortho* isomer being a minor product. A synthesis pathway relying on a minor product cannot be considered \"high-yield.\" Therefore, options A and D are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This option starts with (i) nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by (ii) reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), deactivating the ring and preventing the alkylation. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This option presents the most logical sequence of initial steps for controlling the regiochemistry to get an ortho-substituted product in high yield.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene:** This produces *tert-butylbenzene*.\n    *   **ii) SO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** The bulky tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to sterics, it strongly directs the incoming sulfonic acid group to the para position, yielding *p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid*. This blocks the para position.\n    *   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4 on p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** Now, the ring is nitrated. The tert-butyl group directs to its ortho positions (C2, C6), and the sulfonic acid group directs to its meta positions (C2, C6). Both groups cooperate, directing the nitro group to the position ortho to the tert-butyl group. A known strategy for synthesizing ortho-substituted tert-butylbenzene derivatives involves this exact sequence.\n    *   **Subsequent Steps:** Although the remainder of the steps in option B appear to be out of order or chemically nonsensical (e.g., step vi, nitrating a diazonium salt with mixed acid), the initial three steps represent the only plausible high-yield strategy among the choices to establish the required ortho-relationship between the tert-butyl group and another substituent. The options provided are likely flawed, but option B contains the core correct strategy for regiocontrol. The use of a blocking group is the key to solving this synthetic problem.\n\nBased on the critical strategic step of using a sulfonic acid blocking group to achieve the necessary ortho-substitution in high yield, Option B is the only choice that incorporates this correct initial sequence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern (all adjacent). Let's consider their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strong activator, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Weak activator, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nThe final arrangement has two ortho-, para-directors (-OEt, -tBu) ortho to each other, and a meta-director (-NO2) ortho to the -tBu group but meta to the very strong directing -OEt group. Direct introduction of the nitro group at C3 on a 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene precursor would be very difficult because the strong -OEt group directs incoming electrophiles to positions 4 and 6, not 3. This suggests a more complex strategy is required, likely involving blocking groups or functional group interconversions that change directing effects during the synthesis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final Reaction Step**\n\nMost of the options end with a step involving `NaOH/EtBr`. This is characteristic of the Williamson ether synthesis, which is used to form an ether from an alcohol (in this case, a phenol) and an alkyl halide.\n*   `Ar-OH + NaOH -> Ar-O- Na+` (forms a phenoxide)\n*   `Ar-O- Na+ + EtBr -> Ar-OEt + NaBr`\n\nThis strongly implies that the immediate precursor to our target molecule is a phenol: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The final step is the conversion of this phenol to the ethoxy ether.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options by Elimination**\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical feasibility and whether it leads to the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires an amino (-NH2) group. The product from step (iii) is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, which does not contain an amino group. Therefore, step (iv) is impossible as written. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts with benzene, nitrates it to nitrobenzene (i), then reduces it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards alkylation. Even if the reaction could be made to work (e.g., by protecting the amino group), it would lead to a mixture of o- and p-tert-butylaniline. Subsequent steps starting from either isomer do not lead to the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern (they typically lead to 1,2,4-isomers). **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Let's trace this path:\n    i. Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    ii. Nitration -> 1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major product)\n    iii. Reduction -> 4-tert-Butylaniline\n    iv. Nitration (under acidic conditions, -NH2 becomes -NH3+, a meta-director) -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitroaniline\n    v. Diazotization -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt\n    vi. Hydrolysis -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrophenol\n    vii. Etherification -> 1-Ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\n    The final product has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. This is the wrong isomer. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**4. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nBy elimination, Option A must be the correct choice. Let's analyze its sequence to confirm it is a viable pathway. This path uses a sulfonic acid group as a removable blocking group, a common and powerful strategy for controlling regiochemistry.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Product: **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) + SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation. The bulky t-Bu group sterically hinders ortho-substitution, so the reaction proceeds to the para position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n*   **iii) + HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration. The t-Bu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to t-Bu (and meta to -SO3H). Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This sets up the crucial ortho relationship between the future t-Bu and NO2 groups.\n*   **iv) + Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) + NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid salt**.\n*   **vi) + HNO3/H2SO4 and vii) + H3O+, H2O/Heat**: These two steps are best interpreted as a one-pot process. The diazonium salt is unstable and will react in the hot, acidic, aqueous, nitrating mixture. First, the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group upon heating with water (hydrolysis). Then, the resulting phenol is nitrated.\n    *   Phenol intermediate: **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Nitration of this phenol: The powerful activating -OH group directs the new -NO2 group. The positions ortho and para to the -OH are C3 and C5. While C5 is sterically less hindered, the electronic environment can favor nitration at C3. Assuming the reaction is driven to this product: **2-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **viii) + dilute H2SO4**: Desulfonation. Heating with dilute acid removes the sulfonic acid blocking group. Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. We have now successfully synthesized the key phenol precursor.\n*   **ix) + NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to its ethoxy ether. Final Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis detailed pathway correctly uses all the reagents listed in option A in a chemically logical sequence to arrive at the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   **C1: ethoxy group (-OEt)**. This is a strongly activating, *ortho, para* director.\n*   **C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)**. This is an activating, *ortho, para* director. It is very bulky.\n*   **C3: nitro group (-NO2)**. This is a strongly deactivating, *meta* director.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   All three substituents are adjacent (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n*   The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the deactivating group (-NO2). This is unusual for a direct electrophilic aromatic substitution and is a major clue. It suggests the activating group was not present in its final form during the nitration step, or its directing effect was overridden.\n*   The -tBu and -NO2 groups are ortho to each other.\n*   The -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nWe need to find a sequence of reactions that correctly installs these groups in the specified arrangement with high yield. We will consider the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. Due to its large size, the *para* product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is the major product. The required *ortho* isomer is the minor product, so this step has a low yield for the necessary intermediate.\niii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization. This step requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. However, the product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. Therefore, this reaction sequence is chemically incorrect as written. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The lone pair on the nitrogen of the amino group coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms an anilinium-like complex (-NH2-AlCl3), which is strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director. Thus, alkylation would yield primarily *meta*-tert-butylaniline, not the *ortho* or *para* isomers needed to build towards the target. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para position is blocked).\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group → diazonium salt.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. Diazonium groups are extremely strong deactivators and meta-directors. Performing a nitration under these harsh conditions is not a standard or viable synthetic step and would likely lead to decomposition. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence is the most synthetically plausible, so let's analyze it in detail.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As noted before, this gives mainly the para-isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**, which we will assume is carried forward as the high-yield pathway.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group → **4-tert-butylaniline**.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The amine must be protected to prevent oxidation and to control regioselectivity. Typically, it is converted to an acetamide (-NHCOCH3). The acetamido group is a strong *o,p*-director. Since the *para* position is blocked by the -tBu group, nitration occurs *ortho* to the acetamido group. Product after hydrolysis is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. (An alternative pathway without protection involves forming the anilinium ion, -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both direct nitration to the position meta to the anilinium and ortho to the tBu, leading to **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. So the outcome is the same).\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amine (4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline) → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\nviii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step (vii). The strong directing groups (-OEt, -tBu) would direct sulfonation to the C6 position.\nix) `dilute H2SO4`: Desulfonation. This step removes the sulfonic acid group just added.\n\n**Conclusion on Option D:**\nSteps (i) through (vii) constitute a coherent, high-yield synthetic pathway using standard reactions. The final two steps (viii and ix) appear redundant as they add and then remove a sulfonic acid group. The main issue is that the product synthesized, 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (a 1,2,4-substituted isomer), is an isomer of the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (a 1,2,3-substituted isomer).\n\nHowever, comparing the four options, Options A, B, and C contain steps that are fundamentally flawed or non-viable. Option D, while leading to an isomer of the named product (likely due to an error in the question's premise), consists of a sequence of chemically sound and logical reactions. In the context of a multiple-choice question, Option D is the \"best\" answer because it represents a valid synthetic strategy, whereas the others do not.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nTo solve this problem, we need to devise a synthetic route for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents and the order in which they are introduced.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1.\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2.\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3.\n\nThe key substituent properties are:\n*   **-OEt:** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu:** Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which can influence the position of substitution.\n*   **-NO2:** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical feasibility and regioselectivity.\n\n**Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ...`\n*   Step (i) makes nitrobenzene, and step (ii) makes aniline.\n*   Step (iii) attempts a **Friedel-Crafts alkylation** on aniline. This reaction **fails**. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a strongly deactivated anilinium ion (-NH3+), which prevents the electrophilic alkylation reaction. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n*   This sequence is illogical. Step (v) is a diazotization, which requires an amine (formed in step iv). Step (vi) is a nitration. Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard procedure in a sequence like this; the diazonium salt is a highly reactive intermediate that is typically used immediately for substitution. This sequence does not lead to the desired product in a logical way. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n*   This sequence is impossible. Step (iv) is a **diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`)**, which requires a primary amino group (-NH2) to be present on the ring. The preceding steps (alkylation, nitration, sulfonation) do not form an amino group. Therefore, this reaction cannot be performed at this stage. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; ...`\n*   By elimination, this is the most likely answer. Let's verify the sequence:\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to its bulk, the *para* isomer is favored, but the *ortho* isomer (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed and can be separated.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 and -tBu groups are both *ortho, para*-directors. This step would have low yield for the desired 3-nitro isomer, but it's theoretically possible.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol (-OH group), forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: The phenol is converted to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding the final product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  Steps (viii) and (ix) are extraneous and likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the sequence in Option A has steps that would result in low yields of the desired isomer, it is the only option that is chemically plausible from start to finish. The other options contain fundamental flaws (reactions that fail or are performed in an impossible order). Therefore, Option A is the correct choice among the given alternatives.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's analyze the substitution pattern and the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1:** A strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at position 2:** A weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2) at position 3:** A strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -tBu is *ortho* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *meta* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *ortho* to -tBu.\n\nThis complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern requires careful strategic planning, often involving blocking groups, to control the regioselectivity of the electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's evaluate each option step by step, considering the major products and standard reaction mechanisms.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is bulky, so nitration yields predominantly the *para* product, 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group gives 4-tert-butylaniline.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The strongly activating -NH2 group directs the new -NO2 group *ortho* to itself, yielding 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group gives the corresponding diazonium salt.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces -N2+ with -OH, yielding 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the -OH to -OEt, yielding **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\nThis final product has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4, which is the wrong isomer. The last two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are pointless. Thus, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene (major product).\niii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene. Both -tBu (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) direct the incoming -SO3H group to the same position (position 2 relative to nitro). This gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This step is for diazotization, which requires an amino group (-NH2). The substrate at this stage has no amino group. Therefore, this reaction step is impossible as written. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction → Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is problematic and not \"high-yield\". The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group to form a complex (-NH2-AlCl3), which is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, shutting down the desired alkylation. Furthermore, N-alkylation and polyalkylation are common side reactions. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option utilizes a blocking group strategy, which is the key to achieving this type of substitution pattern. Let's analyze the sequence.\n\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation. To minimize steric hindrance, the -SO3H group adds to the *para* position, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. Now, the -tBu group (o,p-directing) and the -SO3H group (m-directing) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to position 2 (and 6). This gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the -NO2 group to an -NH2 group gives **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\nAt this point, the sequence becomes problematic as written:\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. This reaction is performed at low temperatures (0-5 °C) as diazonium salts are unstable.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of the diazonium salt. This is highly unusual and problematic. Diazonium salts readily decompose, and subjecting one to harsh nitrating conditions is not a standard synthetic step.\n\nHowever, there is likely a typo in the question, and steps (v) and (vi) are swapped. Let's analyze the sequence with the corrected order (vi then v):\nvi') `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration) of 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. In acidic solution, the amine is protonated to -NH3+, which is meta-directing. However, there is an equilibrium, and the unprotonated -NH2 group is a powerful ortho-, para-director. Let's assume conditions are chosen to allow the -NH2 group to direct the substitution. The directing groups are -NH2 (at 2, o,p-director), -tBu (at 4, o,p-director), and -SO3H (at 1, m-director). All three groups direct the incoming electrophile to positions 3 and 5. For the desired product, we need nitration at position 3. While position 5 is sterically more accessible, let's assume conditions can favor position 3, yielding **3-nitro-2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\nv') `NaNO2/HCl` (Diazotization) of the amino group.\nvii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium group is replaced with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to give **3-nitro-2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\nviii) `dilute H2SO4`: Heating with dilute acid causes desulfonation, removing the -SO3H blocking group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\nix) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol (-OH) to an ethoxy ether (-OEt). This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis logically constructed pathway, which uses all the reagents from Option C, successfully synthesizes the target molecule. Since options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed, Option C, despite the likely typo in the order of steps v and vi, is the only plausible choice as it outlines the correct overall strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nRationale Breakdown:\n\nThe goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule first:\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1, tert-Butyl (-tBu) at C2, and Nitro (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   The -OEt and -tBu groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The -tBu and -NO2 groups are also *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The -OEt and -NO2 groups are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern requires a carefully planned sequence of reactions, paying close attention to the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n**Option A:** This sequence lists reagents in a jumbled order, with duplicated step numbers, making it impossible to follow as a coherent synthesis.\n\n**Option D:**\n1.  `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is strongly deactivating.\n2.  `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: This attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming an ammonium salt (-NH3+). This deactivates the ring even more strongly than a nitro group, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** The sequence of reagents is chemically illogical. For example, it attempts diazotization (v) on a molecule that doesn't have a primary aromatic amine and nitration (vi) after diazotization under conditions that would not yield the target.\n\n**Option B:** This option presents the most chemically plausible, albeit challenging, route. Let's analyze it step-by-step, assuming we can control the regiochemistry to favor the desired isomers.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This Friedel-Crafts alkylation yields **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. While the para-isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is the major product due to sterics, the ortho-isomer (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To synthesize the target molecule, we must proceed with this ortho isomer.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group yields **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. The powerful activating amino group (-NH2) must be protected first (e.g., by acetylation to -NHCOCH3), a step often implied in such problems. The acetylamino group is an ortho, para-director. The para position (C5) is sterically hindered by the adjacent C4 hydrogen and the C6 hydrogen. The ortho position (C3) is also sterically hindered by the groups at C1 and C2. However, this is the only way to introduce the nitro group at the required C3 position. The product after deprotection is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the primary amino group in 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline produces a diazonium salt. This is the first step of the Sandmeyer reaction or related substitutions.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by warming in acidic water, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming the final ether product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n8.  **viii) and ix):** The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are superfluous and do not fit in this synthesis, suggesting they may be distractors or errors in the question.\n\nDespite the challenges with yield and regioselectivity at certain steps (ii and iv), this sequence of functional group transformations is the only one provided that logically builds the complex target molecule from the starting material.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents at each step is required. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern, which is often challenging to achieve due to the ortho, para, and meta directing effects of various functional groups.\n\nLet's break down the structure of the final product:\n*   **A benzene ring** is the starting scaffold.\n*   **An ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position C1 (a strongly activating, ortho/para director).\n*   **A tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position C2 (an activating, ortho/para director).\n*   **A nitro group (-NO2)** at position C3 (a strongly deactivating, meta director).\n\nA thorough evaluation of the provided options reveals that options A, B, and D contain chemically unfeasible steps, such as attempting to perform diazotization on a compound without an amino group or trying to nitrate a diazonium salt. This makes them incorrect pathways.\n\nOption C presents the most plausible sequence of reaction *types*, although the regiochemical outcome requires careful consideration. Let's analyze this pathway step-by-step:\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation which attaches a tert-butyl group to the benzene ring, forming tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director, but due to its significant steric bulk, the major product of subsequent reactions is often the para-substituted isomer.\n\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a nitration reaction. The nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields primarily p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** This reaction reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH2), converting p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene into p-tert-butylaniline (also known as 4-tert-butylaniline).\n\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is the second nitration step, now on p-tert-butylaniline. The directing effects must be carefully considered. The amino group is a very strong ortho, para-director, while the tert-butyl group is a weaker ortho, para-director. Typically, an amino group would be protected (e.g., by acetylation) before nitration. However, if the nitration proceeds on the unprotected aniline, the directing effects must be analyzed. One possible, though not always dominant, pathway for nitrating anilines in strong acid involves the protonation of the amino group to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). This ion is a deactivating, meta-director. In the case of the p-tert-butylanilinium ion, the -NH3+ group at C1 would direct nitration to the C3 position, while the activating -tBu group at C4 directs to the C3 position. This synergistic effect would lead to the formation of 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\n\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the primary amino group of 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline into a diazonium salt.\n\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, replacing the -N2+ group with an -OH group, yielding 3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\n\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This final step is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenolic -OH group is deprotonated by NaOH and then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether, yielding the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Note: the IUPAC priority rules change, causing the ethoxy-bearing carbon to be numbered C1).\n\nWhile the regiochemical outcome of step (iv) can be complex, the sequence of transformations presented in option C is the only one that is chemically logical and avoids impossible reaction steps, leading to a structure consistent with the target molecule's substitution pattern. The final two steps listed in option C, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, appear to be superfluous or incorrectly placed, but the core synthesis pathway (i-vii) remains the only viable option among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nAn analysis of the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, reveals a 1,2,3-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. A high-yield synthesis of such a molecule requires careful control of the regiochemistry at each step, making use of the directing effects of the substituents.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene, then reducing it to aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a strongly deactivating anilinium complex which prevents the electrophilic substitution. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    This sequence is chemically illogical. For instance, step (iv) attempts to perform diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) on a nitro-sulfonated intermediate. Diazotization is a reaction for primary aromatic amines, which are only formed much later in the proposed sequence at step (viii) (Fe/HCl). The order of reactions is incorrect. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    This sequence also contains a chemically nonsensical step. After forming a diazonium salt in step (v), step (vi) suggests a nitration reaction. Diazonium salts are generally not nitrated in this manner; they are typically used in substitution or coupling reactions. This step makes the entire sequence incorrect as written. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    This sequence is composed of chemically plausible steps, so let's analyze the regiochemical outcome:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** This Friedel-Crafts alkylation yields **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene:** The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is the para isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A high-yield synthesis would proceed with this major isomer.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction of the nitro group:** `Fe/HCl` reduces the nitrobenzene derivative to **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline:** In a strong acidic medium like `HNO3/H2SO4`, the basic amino group is protonated to form an anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a **meta-director**. The t-butyl group at position 4 is an ortho,para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions meta to the anilinium ion, i.e., positions 3 and 5. This leads to the formation of **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group of 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** Heating the diazonium salt in aqueous acid yields a phenol: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is reacted with sodium hydroxide and ethyl bromide to form the corresponding ether: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  The remaining steps (viii, ix) are sulfonation and desulfonation, which are not necessary at this stage and suggest a possible flaw in the question's construction, but the core synthesis pathway is established by steps i-vii.\n\nThe final product from this logical sequence is `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`, which is a 1,3,4-substituted isomer, not the target 1,2,3-substituted `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. However, Options B, C, and D contain fundamentally impossible reaction sequences. Option A describes a sequence of valid chemical reactions that would lead to a high yield of a specific isomer, leveraging the meta-directing effect of the anilinium ion.

    "This problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** from benzene. This is a complex synthesis problem due to the 1,2,3-substitution pattern, which is sterically crowded and electronically non-trivial to achieve.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Devise a Strategy**\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1, tert-Butyl (-tBu) at C2, Nitro (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Activating, *ortho, para*-director (but bulky, so favors *para* substitution).\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Structural Features:**\n    1.  The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    2.  The tert-butyl and nitro groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    3.  The powerful activating ethoxy group is *meta* to the nitro group.\n\nThe meta relationship between the -OEt and -NO2 groups is a major red flag. Direct nitration of a molecule containing an ethoxy group would not place the nitro group in a meta position. This indicates that a sophisticated, multi-step strategy is required. The most effective strategy for such a synthesis often involves a **blocking group** to control the regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is the classic choice for a reversible blocking group.\n\n**Step 2: A Plausible High-Yield Synthesis Using a Blocking Group**\n\nA logical synthesis can be constructed as follows:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Introduce the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   *Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene*\n2.  **Blocking:** Use sulfonation to block the sterically accessible *para* position.\n    *   *tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid*\n3.  **First Nitration:** Now, nitration is directed to the *ortho* position by both the t-Bu group (since para is blocked) and the meta-directing -SO3H group.\n    *   *4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid*\n4.  **Reduction:** Reduce the nitro group to an amine, a versatile intermediate.\n    *   *... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid*\n5.  **Second Nitration:** To get the final nitro group, we must nitrate again. This is a key step. The existing groups (-NH2, -tBu, -SO3H) all direct the incoming nitro group to position C3 or C5. Let's assume C3.\n    *   *... + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-nitro-2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid*\n6.  **Diazotization:** Convert the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n    *   *... + NaNO2/HCl → ...diazonium salt*\n7.  **Hydrolysis:** Convert the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n    *   *... + H3O+/Heat → 2-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid*\n8.  **Etherification:** Convert the phenol to an ether.\n    *   *... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid*\n9.  **Removal of Blocking Group:** Desulfonate to get the final product.\n    *   *... + dilute H2SO4/Heat → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene*\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow we must see which of the options provides the \"toolkit\" of reagents for this synthesis, as all the options are flawed in their listed order.\n\n*   **Option A & D:** These options start with alkylation followed immediately by nitration. This leads to the wrong isomer (`p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`) as the major product, which is inconsistent with a high-yield synthesis. Option D is also missing the reagents for sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`), making the required blocking group strategy impossible.\n*   **Option B:** Contains chemically impossible steps in the sequence as written (e.g., nitrating a diazonium salt).\n*   **Option C:** This option, while the listed order is flawed, is the **only one that contains the complete set of reagents required for the logical synthesis outlined above**:\n    *   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (for alkylation)\n    *   `SO3/H2SO4` (for blocking)\n    *   `HNO3/H2SO4` (for two nitrations)\n    *   `Fe/HCl` (for reduction)\n    *   `NaNO2/HCl` (for diazotization)\n    *   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (for hydrolysis to phenol)\n    *   `NaOH/EtBr` (for etherification - though missing in this specific list) -> *Correction: Looking closely at the original prompt, C is missing the etherification step while other options have it. This indicates a general issue with the provided options. However, let's re-examine C's reagent list from the agents' answers: C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr. This full list does contain all the reagents.*\n\nGiven the analysis that a blocking group is essential and that Option C is the only one providing the complete toolkit for such a synthesis (Alkylation, Sulfonation, Nitration, Reduction, Diazotization, Hydrolysis, Desulfonation, and Etherification reagents), it is the most plausible intended answer, despite the jumbled order of the steps. The other options are definitively incorrect because they are either chemically impossible or they lead to the wrong isomer via their high-yield pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>"

To solve it, we need to analyze the target molecule and consider the directing effects of the substituents, steric hindrance, and possible functional group interconversions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1: A strong activating group, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2: A weak activating group, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3: A strong deactivating group, meta director.\n\n*   **Relative positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe most striking feature is that the nitro group is *meta* to the strongly activating ethoxy group. A standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) like nitration on a precursor containing the ethoxy group would strongly direct the nitro group to the ortho and para positions, not the meta position. This suggests that either:\na) The group at position 1 was a meta-director during the nitration step.\nb) A blocking group was used to force nitration into the desired position.\nc) The nitro group was introduced by a non-EAS mechanism.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's consider the final steps. The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis, as this is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect other groups.\n*   **Final Step:** Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr or NaOEt).\n*   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to synthesizing **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern (-OH, -tBu, -NO2). This is still a challenging synthesis. A powerful strategy for controlling substitution patterns is the use of a **blocking group**, typically a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be introduced and later removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**3. A Plausible Synthetic Route**\n\nLet's outline a logical synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol starting from a simpler material like phenol (which can be made from benzene).\n\n1.  **Start with Phenol.**\n2.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** React phenol with a tert-butyl source (e.g., tert-butanol/acid or tert-butyl chloride/catalyst). This gives a mixture of *o*- and *p*-tert-butylphenol. We need the *ortho* isomer. Let's assume we can separate **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n3.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** React o-tert-butylphenol with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4). The -OH and -tBu groups are both ortho/para directors. They will both direct the incoming -SO3H group to position 4 (para to -OH, meta to -tBu) and position 6 (ortho to -OH, ortho to -tBu). The para position (4) is sterically more accessible.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Nitration:** Now, nitrate this intermediate with HNO3/H2SO4. The available positions are 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   -OH (position 1) directs ortho/para (to 3, 5).\n    *   -tBu (position 2) directs ortho/para (to 3, 5).\n    *   -SO3H (position 4) directs meta (to 3, 5).\n    *   All three groups direct the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is sterically hindered, being between the -OH and -tBu groups. However, it is electronically activated by both. Let's assume the reaction can be forced to yield the desired isomer.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-1-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking Step):** Heat the product from the previous step with dilute aqueous acid (e.g., dilute H2SO4 or H3O+/Heat). This removes the sulfonic acid group.\n    *   Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n6.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** React the phenol with a base (NaOH) and an ethylating agent (EtBr).\n    *   Final Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow let's see which option matches this logical pathway. The key strategic elements are the use of sulfonation/desulfonation as a blocking strategy and the final conversion of a phenol to an ether.\n\n*   **Option A & B:** These sequences contain chemically impossible steps. Option A attempts diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) on a nitro compound. Option B suggests nitrating a diazonium salt. Both are incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence does not effectively use a blocking group strategy to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern and would likely lead to other isomers.\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nLet's analyze this option.\n*   It contains all the necessary reagents for the plausible synthesis outlined above: nitration, reduction, alkylation, diazotization, sulfonation, desulfonation (hydrolysis), and etherification.\n*   The final steps, **(viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat** followed by **(ix) NaOH/EtBr**, perfectly match the logical final steps of our proposed synthesis (desulfonation/hydrolysis to a phenol, then etherification).\n*   While the order of the preceding steps (i-vii) appears confusing and may contain typos or represent an alternative, highly complex pathway, the presence of the correct \"toolkit\" of reagents and the logical final steps make it the most plausible choice. The other options are fundamentally flawed with impossible reactions. The synthesis I outlined can be constructed by rearranging the steps in option C and using some reagents to first synthesize phenol from benzene (i, ii, v, viii).\n\nGiven the choices, Option C represents the only viable overall strategy, even if the sequence as written is problematic. It is the \"best\" answer among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and evaluate the proposed synthetic routes.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The groups are in a 1,2,3-arrangement.\n*   -OEt is at C1, -tBu is at C2, and -NO2 is at C3.\n*   Relative positions: -OEt and -tBu are *ortho*; -OEt and -NO2 are *meta*; -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho*.\n\n**Analysis of Directing Effects:**\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings substituted with a nitro group.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A & B:** These sequences involve sulfonation and subsequent reactions. However, they contain steps in an illogical order. For instance, option A calls for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) at step (iv) when no primary aromatic amine has been formed. Option B calls for nitration of a diazonium salt at step (vi), which is not a standard transformation for this type of synthesis. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Even if the amine were protected (e.g., as an acetanilide), alkylation would predominantly occur at the para position, not yielding the necessary ortho-substituted product in high yield. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence represents a common and logical strategy in multi-step aromatic synthesis: introduce groups, modify their directing effects, and use them to place subsequent substituents correctly.\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is overwhelmingly the para isomer, **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**. This is a high-yield step.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **p-tert-butylaniline**. This reaction changes the substituent from a meta-director to a powerful ortho, para-director.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The strongly activating amino group and the tert-butyl group both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the amine. This forms **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, giving **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nAt this point, the main framework is constructed. The final two steps listed in option D, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, are redundant as they would add and then immediately remove a sulfonic acid group from the molecule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe synthesis outlined in steps (i) through (vii) of option D is a chemically sound, high-yield pathway. However, it produces **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule named in the question. The other options (A, B, C) contain chemically flawed steps. Given that this is a multiple-choice question, it is highly probable that there is a typo in the name of the target compound in the question prompt, and that the valid synthetic pathway presented in option D is the intended correct answer. It is the only sequence that follows a logical and high-yield synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The desired product is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. This is a benzene ring with three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. The key feature is the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:** We will examine each proposed reaction sequence to see if it is chemically logical and if it leads to the desired substitution pattern.\n\n3.  **Option A Analysis:**\n    *   `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n    *   `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n    *   `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This step is not efficient.\n    *   Furthermore, step `vi) SO3/H2SO4` on a diazonium salt from step `v)` is not a standard reaction. This option is chemically flawed.\n\n4.  **Option C Analysis:**\n    *   This sequence lists `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) immediately after `iii) SO3/H2SO4`. Diazotization requires an aromatic primary amine, which has not been formed at this stage. This sequence is out of order and incorrect.\n\n5.  **Option D Analysis:**\n    *   This sequence lists `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` (nitration) on a diazonium salt formed in step `v)`. Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard synthetic procedure. This option is chemically flawed.\n\n6.  **Option B Analysis:** This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze it in detail.\n    *   `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but sterically hinders the ortho position. The major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. This yields **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. This is the key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a strong deactivator and a **meta-director**. The t-butyl group at position 4 is an ortho,para-director.\n        *   The -NH3+ group at C1 directs the incoming nitro group to C3.\n        *   The -tBu group at C4 directs the incoming nitro group to C3 (which is ortho to it).\n        *   Both groups direct the substitution to the same position (C3). This leads to the formation of **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amine group to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   Steps `viii)` and `ix)` (sulfonation and desulfonation) are redundant and do not alter the product from step `vii`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The sequence in Option B produces 1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene. This is an isomer of the target molecule (2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene). However, Options A, C, and D contain chemically nonsensical steps. Option B describes a valid, albeit complex, synthesis pathway. It is the only chemically coherent choice, suggesting there is likely an error in the name of the target molecule in the problem statement.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The relationship between the groups is:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects is crucial for planning the order of substitution reactions.\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-butyl (-tBu)**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it favors *para* substitution.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino (-NH2)** (as an intermediate): Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Anilinium (-NH3+)** (formed from -NH2 in strong acid): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence**\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to see if it's chemically sound and leads to the desired product.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\nii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\niii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation. (Plausible)\niv) **NaNO2/HCl**: This is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). At this stage, there is no amine group on the molecule.\nThis sequence is incorrect because the reagents are in the wrong order.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene → Nitrobenzene. (Plausible)\nii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene → Aniline. (Plausible)\niii) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the nitrogen atom in the amino group. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the alkylation reaction.\nThis sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Plausible)\nii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid (major product). (Plausible)\niii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Plausible)\niv) Fe/HCl: Reduction of nitro group → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. (Plausible)\nv) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization → Diazonium salt. (Plausible)\nvi) **HNO3/H2SO4**: This step attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates. Treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard or viable synthetic procedure; they would likely decompose.\nThis sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nBy elimination, this should be the correct sequence. Let's analyze it carefully. The synthesis of a 1,2,3-substituted product is often challenging and may involve steps with low yields. We must determine if this path is at least chemically possible.\n\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\nii) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. The *para* isomer (4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) is major due to sterics, but the *ortho* isomer (**1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To get the final 1,2,3-product, we must proceed with the *ortho* isomer, even if it's a minor product.\niii) **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group. 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene → **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. (Standard reduction).\niv) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. We need to introduce the new nitro group at position 3 (relative to the final product numbering), which is *meta* to the anilinium group and *ortho* to the tert-butyl group. While the directing effects are conflicting and the yield may be low, the formation of **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** is plausible.\nv) **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. (Standard reaction).\nvi) **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. (Standard reaction).\nvii) **NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is the desired final product.\n\nSteps (viii) SO3/H2SO4 and (ix) dilute H2SO4 are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed. They might be included as red herrings or represent an error in the question's formulation. However, the core sequence (i-vii) is the only one among the options that can chemically lead to the target molecule, even if some steps are not high-yield.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a chemically plausible (though not necessarily high-yield) route to the target product. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   Three substituents:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted or vicinal substitution pattern.\n*   The directing effects of the groups are:\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt is ortho to -tBu.\n*   -tBu is ortho to -NO2.\n*   -OEt is meta to -NO2.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires a careful strategy, frequently involving blocking groups to control the regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA common final step for synthesizing an ether is the **Williamson ether synthesis**. This means the immediate precursor would be the corresponding phenol.\n*   **Final Step:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    This matches step (ix) in option A: `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to synthesizing the precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   The phenol group (-OH) is typically introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+). This is done with `H2O/Heat`. This matches step (vii) in option A.\n*   The diazonium salt is formed from a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) using `NaNO2/HCl`. This matches step (v) in option A.\n\nThis suggests a strategy where we construct a complex aniline derivative, convert it to a phenol, and then to an ether. The sulfonic acid group (`SO3H`) is a common tool in such multi-step syntheses, acting as a blocking group and a directing group, which can be removed later by **desulfonation** (using `dilute H2SO4/Heat`). This matches step (viii) in option A.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed sequences based on this understanding.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by making aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and causing meta-alkylation. This is not a clean or efficient method. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** Both start with `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` to make tert-butylbenzene, followed by `ii) HNO3/H2SO4` (nitration).\n    Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of ortho- and para-isomers. The para-isomer is major (~70-80%), but the ortho-isomer is also formed. A synthesis that starts with a mixture is generally not considered \"high-yield\". Furthermore, Option C has an impossible step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` on a molecule without an amino group. Option B proceeds to nitrate an aniline derivative directly (`iv) HNO3/H2SO4`), which is a very messy reaction prone to oxidation and poor control. Thus, B and C are unlikely to be correct.\n\n*   **Option A:** Let's analyze this sequence in detail, as it seems the most promising.\n\n    i) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.**\n       *   Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    ii) **tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the sterically accessible para position. This is a high-yield, regioselective step. This is a classic use of a blocking group.\n\n    iii) **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both groups direct the incoming -NO2 group to the same position (position 2, which is ortho to -tBu and meta to -SO3H). This is another high-yield, regioselective step.\n\n    iv) **... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.**\n       *   Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. Standard procedure.\n\n    v) **... + NaNO2/HCl → 4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfobenzenediazonium chloride.**\n       *   Diazotization of the amino group. Standard procedure.\n\n    At this point, we have a diazonium salt with the substituents correctly positioned for further manipulation. The subsequent steps are confusingly written but represent the necessary transformations to reach the final product.\n\n    vi) **... + HNO3/H2SO4**\n       *   This step is the most confusing. It is likely a typo or represents a more complex transformation. A plausible interpretation in the context of a complex synthesis puzzle is a second nitration. The existing groups (-N2+, -tBu, -SO3H) would all direct an incoming electrophile to position 6. Let's assume this happens.\n       *   Product: **6-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfobenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n    vii) **... + H3O+, H2O/Heat**\n       *   This step converts the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n       *   Product: **6-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)-2-sulfophenol**.\n\n    viii) **... + dilute H2SO4**\n       *   This step is desulfonation, removing the -SO3H group.\n       *   Product: **3-(tert-butyl)-5-nitrophenol**. This is not the correct precursor.\n\n    **Revisiting the Logic:**\n    Despite the confusing final steps, the initial sequence of Option A (i, ii, iii) is the most logical and efficient way to create a specific trisubstituted intermediate from benzene in high yield. The other options have clear flaws in their early steps (creating mixtures or using problematic reactions). It is common in such problems for the correct option to represent the best overall strategy, even if it contains typos or obscure steps. The strategy in A is to use a para-blocking group (-SO3H) to force subsequent substitutions into specific positions, which is the correct approach for this type of target. The subsequent steps involve the correct types of reagents (for reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, desulfonation, and etherification) to convert the intermediate into the final product, even if their exact sequence or purpose as written is ambiguous. Given the clear flaws in B, C, and D, A remains the most plausible choice.\n\n    Let's assume a different, more logical sequence of the later steps that leads to the correct product, which the question author might have intended.\n    Starting from **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid** (product of step iv):\n    1.  Nitrate (this would be step vi). This requires protection of the amine, then nitration (which goes to position 3 or 5), then deprotection. Let's assume it goes to position 3. Product: **2-amino-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    2.  Diazotize the amino group (step v).\n    3.  Replace the diazonium group with -H (deamination, e.g., with H3PO2, a common reaction not explicitly listed but could be implied by the overall transformation). Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  Replace the -SO3H group with -OH (e.g., by alkali fusion, another step not listed but necessary). Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is the correct precursor.\n    5.  Etherify with NaOH/EtBr (step ix).\n\n    While this requires steps not listed, it shows that the intermediate from A(iv) can be converted to the target. The key is that the initial steps of A are the only ones that set up the regiochemistry correctly in a high-yield manner.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A provides the most chemically sound strategy for a high-yield synthesis, especially in the crucial initial steps that establish the substitution pattern. The other options involve steps that would lead to mixtures or are chemically infeasible. Therefore, despite the confusing nature of the later steps, Option A is the best answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of the proposed options is necessary, considering the directing effects of the substituents and the compatibility of the reactions.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. This 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is sterically crowded, and its synthesis requires careful planning of the reaction order.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option A:** This sequence starts with the tert-butylation of benzene, followed by nitration. The tert-butyl group is ortho, para-directing, but due to its large size, it primarily directs incoming groups to the para position. This would lead to 4-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene, making it difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Analysis of Option B:** This sequence begins with the nitration of benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. The third step is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, and the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) would react with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this pathway is not viable.\n*   **Analysis of Option C:** This route involves using a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a blocking group. After tert-butylation, sulfonation occurs at the para position. Subsequent nitration would be directed to the position ortho to the tert-butyl group. This leads to a 1,2,4-substituted intermediate, which is not the correct isomer for the final product.\n*   **Analysis of Option D:** This sequence presents the most chemically sound, albeit complex, route to the target molecule.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. For this synthesis, the ortho isomer is required, which would need to be separated.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is reduced to an amino group, forming 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a critical step. In the strongly acidic nitrating mixture, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). This ion is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to positions 3 and 5. This is a known strategy for synthesizing such substitution patterns. The desired 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is formed, along with the 5-nitro isomer.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amino group of 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide to form the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nThe subsequent steps (viii and ix) in option D appear to be extraneous, but the core sequence from (i) to (vii) correctly and logically produces the desired compound. This makes Option D the only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe user wants to identify the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents to determine a logical synthetic strategy.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The substituents are a tert-butyl group (-tBu), an ethoxy group (-OEt), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   They are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   -OEt is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   -tBu is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards):**\n\n1.  **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is typically added last via a Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr) on the corresponding phenol. The immediate precursor is therefore **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n2.  **Phenol Formation:** A common way to introduce a hydroxyl group onto a benzene ring is through the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt (e.g., adding H₃O⁺/H₂O and heat). The precursor for this step would be the diazonium salt derived from **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n3.  **Diazonium Salt Formation:** This is achieved by treating an aniline with nitrous acid (NaNO₂/HCl). The precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n4.  **Synthesis of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the most challenging step, as it requires establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. Let's analyze the options to see how this might be achieved. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is complex; the powerful amino group directs ortho and para (to positions 4 and 6), not the desired position 3. A more controlled method is needed.\n\nLet's evaluate the provided options based on fundamental principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with nitration (i) to form nitrobenzene. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation (iii) on the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring would fail or give a very low yield. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is chemically illogical. Step (iv) is the diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl), which requires an amine. However, the amine is not formed until step (viii) (Fe/HCl reduction). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that has not yet been created. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is also illogical. An amine is formed in step (iv) and converted to a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt, which is not a standard or viable reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, with o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene as a minor product. For a high-yield synthesis, we must follow the major product.\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. This converts p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene to **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is a very strong ortho, para-director. To avoid oxidation and control the reaction, the amine is typically protected first (e.g., by acetylation, a step often implied in such problems). The directing effect of the resulting acetamido group (-NHCOCH₃) is still strongly ortho-directing. Nitration will occur at the position ortho to the amine/acetamido group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline** (after deprotection).\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline to form a **diazonium salt**.\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, resulting in **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`: These last two steps, sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and appear to be extraneous.\n\nWhile steps (i) through (vii) of option B outline a coherent synthesis, they produce an isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) of the desired product. The other options (A, C, D) contain fundamental flaws in their reaction order. Given the choices, Option B is the only one that contains a plausible (though flawed) multi-step synthetic sequence. It is highly likely that there is an error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the listed steps. However, among the given choices, B represents the most chemically reasonable sequence, despite its inconsistencies.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a thorough analysis of each proposed route is necessary, paying close attention to the directing effects of the substituents and the viability of each reaction.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** A strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** A strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nLet's evaluate the provided options:\n\n**Option A:**\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, while the desired 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is the minor product. This step already compromises the \"high-yield\" objective.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene gives 2-(tert-butyl)aniline.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Crucially, both the -NH3+ group (at C1) and the -tBu group (at C2) direct incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5. This reaction can produce the required 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline, although likely as a mixture with the 5-nitro isomer.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group in 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline forms a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, forming the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n8.  **viii) SO3/H2SO4 & ix) dilute H2SO4:** These final two steps, sulfonation and desulfonation, are superfluous as the target molecule has already been synthesized.\n\nDespite the low-yield steps and the extraneous final steps, this sequence is chemically plausible and leads to the correct product structure.\n\n**Option B:** This sequence introduces a blocking group (-SO3H) but contains a chemically incorrect step: `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt is not a standard transformation. The overall order of reactions is also illogical for producing the target molecule.\n\n**Option C:** This option is flawed at step `iv) NaNO2/HCl`, which attempts to form a diazonium salt from a substrate that does not contain an amino group.\n\n**Option D:** This sequence fails at step `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A is the only sequence that presents a chemically viable, albeit not high-yielding, pathway to the target molecule. The other options contain fundamentally flawed chemical steps. Therefore, despite its imperfections, Option A is the best choice among the given alternatives.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a vicinal (1,2,3) trisubstituted benzene. The directing effects of the substituents are:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nSynthesizing such a sterically crowded molecule with this specific electronic arrangement requires a carefully planned multi-step synthesis, often involving blocking groups or building the molecule from a precursor where the directing effects align favorably.\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nLet's think backward from the product (retrosynthesis).\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is an ether. The most common way to form an aryl ether is the Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide (from a phenol) with an alkyl halide.\n    *   Precursor: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   Reaction: Deprotonation with a base (like NaOH) followed by reaction with an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr).\n    *   This corresponds to the reagent `NaOH/EtBr` found in the options.\n\n*   **Key Intermediate:** Our main challenge is to synthesize the precursor, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Key Intermediate:** How can we make 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol? Let's consider adding the substituents to a simpler ring.\n    *   **Path A: Start with m-nitrophenol and add a tert-butyl group.**\n        *   In m-nitrophenol (OH at C1, NO2 at C3), we need to add a t-Bu group at C2.\n        *   Let's check the directing effects for Friedel-Crafts alkylation:\n            *   The -OH group is a strong activator and directs *ortho* (to C2, C6) and *para* (to C4).\n            *   The -NO2 group is a strong deactivator and directs *meta* (to C5).\n            *   The powerful -OH group controls the reaction. It directs the incoming electrophile (the t-butyl cation) to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n            *   Alkylation at position 2 gives the desired product: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. While a mixture with 4- and 6-alkylated products is expected, this is a plausible way to form the required C-C bond at the correct position.\n\n    *   **Path B: Start with 2-tert-butylphenol and add a nitro group.**\n        *   In 2-tert-butylphenol (OH at C1, tBu at C2), we need to nitrate at C3.\n        *   Directing effects for nitration:\n            *   -OH directs *ortho* (C6) and *para* (C4).\n            *   -tBu directs *ortho* (C3) and *para* (C5).\n            *   The -OH group is a much stronger activator than -tBu and will dominate, leading to nitration at positions 4 and 6. This path will not yield the desired 3-nitro product.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** Path A is the more plausible route. The synthesis should proceed through m-nitrophenol.\n\n**3. Construct the Full Synthesis from Benzene**\n\nNow, let's build the full sequence, starting from benzene, to get to the final product via Path A.\n\n*   **Step 1: Synthesis of m-Nitrophenol from Benzene.**\n    This is a standard textbook synthesis:\n    a.  **Nitration:** Benzene is nitrated to form nitrobenzene. (Reagent: `HNO3/H2SO4`)\n    b.  **Second Nitration:** Nitrobenzene is nitrated again under harsher conditions. The -NO2 group is a meta-director, so this forms m-dinitrobenzene. (Reagent: `HNO3/H2SO4`)\n    c.  **Selective Reduction:** One of the two nitro groups in m-dinitrobenzene is selectively reduced to an amino group using a reagent like Na2S or (NH4)2S. The options provide `Fe/HCl`, which typically reduces all nitro groups, but for the sake of a multiple-choice question, we may have to assume it can be controlled or it's the intended reagent for reduction. This step yields m-nitroaniline. (Reagent: `Fe/HCl`)\n    d.  **Diazotization:** The amino group of m-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. (Reagent: `NaNO2/HCl`)\n    e.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in an aqueous acidic solution to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming m-nitrophenol. (Reagent: `H3O+, H2O/Heat`)\n\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation of m-Nitrophenol.**\n    f.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** m-Nitrophenol is reacted with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst to introduce the tert-butyl group. As determined earlier, this can yield the desired 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. (Reagent: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`)\n\n*   **Step 3: Etherification.**\n    g.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to its conjugate base with NaOH, which then reacts with ethyl bromide to form the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. (Reagent: `NaOH/EtBr`)\n\n**4. Match the Synthesis with the Given Options**\n\nLet's see which option provides the necessary reagents for this 7-step synthesis. The required reagents are:\n`HNO3/H2SO4` (used twice), `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nLet's examine the reagent list for each option:\n*   **A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4\n*   C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr\n*   D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nOption A contains all the necessary reagents for our proposed synthesis:\n*   `HNO3/H2SO4` (listed twice, as ii and ix)\n*   `Fe/HCl` (listed as viii)\n*   `NaNO2/HCl` (listed as iv)\n*   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (listed as vi)\n*   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (listed as i)\n*   `NaOH/EtBr` (listed as vii)\n\nThe other options are missing key reagents or include steps that lead to the wrong isomer. For example, Option C involves Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (step iii), which is not a feasible reaction. Options B and D, through logical application of their steps, would lead to 1,2,4- or 1,3,4-substituted isomers, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n\nAlthough the sequence of reactions in Option A is written in a scrambled and incorrect order, it is the only option that provides the complete set of reagents required for a plausible (though complex) synthesis of the target molecule. Therefore, it is the best choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's draw its structure and identify the substituents and their relative positions.\n\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern, which is sterically crowded.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents direct incoming groups:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It's very bulky, which influences regioselectivity.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's consider the final step of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Could the last step be nitration?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene. The powerful activating -OEt group would direct nitration to its para position (C4) and ortho position (C6). The desired C3 position is meta to the -OEt group, so this would be a very minor product. This is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Could the last step be Friedel-Crafts alkylation?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The -OEt group (o,p-director) and the -NO2 group (m-director) both direct incoming electrophiles to positions 2, 4, and 6. However, the bulky tert-butyl group would preferentially add to the least sterically hindered position (likely C4 or C6), not the highly hindered C2 position between two existing groups. Also, Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on deactivated rings. This is not a high-yield route.\n\n*   **Could the last step be ether formation?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. The conversion of a phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt) using Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH to form the phenoxide, followed by EtBr) is a standard, high-yield reaction. This is a very plausible final step.\n    *   **Step vii) NaOH/EtBr** is consistent with this.\n\nNow, how to synthesize the precursor, **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**?\nA common way to make phenols is via the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, which is made from an aniline.\n*   Phenol Precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n*   Reaction Sequence: ...-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> ...-N2+ --(H3O+/Heat)--> ...-OH.\n    *   **Step v) NaNO2/HCl** and **Step vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat** are consistent with this.\n\nNow, how to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**?\nLet's renumber this molecule for easier synthetic planning: 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. This has the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern. It is very difficult to create this pattern by direct substitution onto a simple benzene derivative.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options, as they must contain the correct (or most plausible) path. The options seem to have typos and extra steps, so we must focus on the core chemical transformations.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **Option A & B:** Contain chemically illogical steps, such as attempting diazotization on a molecule without an amine group (A) or nitrating a diazonium salt (B). These are incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. FC alkylation on aniline is problematic; it typically requires protection of the amine or occurs on the anilinium ion (meta-directing). Neither route easily leads to the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern after subsequent nitration.\n*   **Option D:** This option seems the most promising, despite its confusing structure. Let's analyze the sequence of transformations it suggests, even if the order or completeness is flawed.\n\n**5. Detailed Analysis of the most plausible pathway (based on reagents in Option D)**\n\nA viable, albeit complex, route to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with this pattern involves dinitration followed by selective reduction. Let's see if the reagents in Option D fit this path.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is major, but the ortho isomer is also formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n3.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** A second nitration. Nitrating o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (C1-tBu, C2-NO2). Both the -tBu group (o,p-directing) and the -NO2 group (m-directing) direct the second nitro group to positions 4 and 6. This gives a mixture of 2,4-dinitro- and **2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene**. Let's assume we can isolate the desired **2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n4.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of a nitro group. In 2,6-dinitro-tert-butylbenzene, the two nitro groups are equivalent. A controlled reduction (e.g., using (NH4)2S, but Fe/HCl can also be used) can reduce one of them to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization. The amino group of 2-amino-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is converted to a diazonium salt.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis. The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming **2-hydroxy-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson Ether Synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH and then treated with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the ether, yielding **2-ethoxy-6-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nLet's check the name of this final product according to IUPAC rules. The priority for numbering is -OEt > -tBu > -NO2.\n*   The carbon with the -OEt group is C1.\n*   The adjacent carbon with the -tBu group is C2.\n*   The next carbon with the -NO2 group is C3.\nThe name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This matches the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions described above successfully produces the target molecule. This sequence uses the reagents listed in Option D. Although the order of steps (iii) and (iv) is swapped in the option text and there are superfluous steps (viii, ix) listed at the end, Option D is the only one that contains the necessary reagents for a chemically plausible synthesis. The other options contain fundamentally incorrect chemical steps. Therefore, despite its flaws, Option D represents the correct synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. A successful synthesis depends on introducing the substituents in the correct order, taking into account their directing effects and the chemical compatibility of the reactions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Substituents**\n\n*   **Target Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents and their properties:**\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the ortho position.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Intermediates:** To introduce the -OEt group, a common strategy is to first create a phenol (-OH) and then perform a Williamson ether synthesis. A phenol can be made from an amino group (-NH₂) via a diazonium salt. An amino group is typically made by reducing a nitro group.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical validity:\n\n**Option D:**\ni) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene. (Valid)\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline. (Valid)\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction **fails** when attempted on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents the alkylation reaction.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect because step (iii) is not a viable reaction.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\niii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of the product from step (ii). (Valid)\niv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: This reagent combination is used for diazotization, a reaction that converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt. The substrate from step (iii) is not an amine.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect because step (iv) is performed on an inappropriate substrate.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\niii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of the product from step (ii). (Valid)\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. (Valid)\nv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\nvi) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: This step proposes reacting the diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture. This is **not a standard or logical synthetic transformation**. The goal is to create a phenol to later form the ether, which is typically achieved by heating the diazonium salt in aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect because step (vi) is chemically nonsensical in this context.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The desired 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is a minor product, but it is formed. (Valid step)\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene to yield 2-tert-butylaniline. (Valid)\niv) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3, yielding 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. (Valid step)\nv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\nvi) `H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form the corresponding phenol, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. (Valid)\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to a phenoxide by NaOH, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ether product. (Valid)\nviii) & ix): The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are superfluous and would not be part of an efficient synthesis, but the core pathway from (i) to (vii) is chemically sound.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Option A, while not ideal in terms of yield due to poor regioselectivity in some steps, represents the only chemically plausible pathway from start to finish among the choices provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nOf course. Here is a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the reasoning process to determine the correct synthetic pathway.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the desired product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n    *   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1.\n    *   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2.\n    *   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3.\n*   **Directing Effects:** Understanding how these groups influence further substitutions is crucial.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. However, it is very large (sterically bulky), which strongly hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** A strongly activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **The Core Synthetic Challenge:** The main difficulty in this synthesis is placing a substituent *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. A standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene will almost exclusively yield the *para* product due to steric hindrance. A successful synthesis must therefore use a specific strategy to overcome this.\n\n### **2. Evaluation of the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option to see if it is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n#### **Option D: Incorrect**\n1.  `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. **This reaction fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) is an acid that reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the alkylation reaction.\n\n#### **Option B: Incorrect**\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (the para product is major).\n3.  `iii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step ii.\n4.  `iv) NaNO2/HCl`: This is a diazotization reaction. **This reaction fails.** Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine.\n\n#### **Option C: Incorrect (Leads to the Wrong Isomer)**\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As established, due to the steric bulk of the -tBu group, the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n3.  The rest of the synthesis would proceed from this 1,4-disubstituted (para) intermediate. It is impossible to rearrange this structure to the required 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. This sequence would produce an isomer of the target molecule, but not the target molecule itself.\n\n#### **Option A: Correct Strategy**\nThis sequence employs a clever and necessary strategy using a **blocking group**.\n\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  `ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) adds to the sterically most accessible position, which is *para* to the tert-butyl group. This forms **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The purpose of this step is to **block** the para position.\n3.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now that the *para* position is blocked, the incoming nitro group is forced to go to a position *ortho* to the tert-butyl group. Both existing groups direct the new substituent to this same position:\n    *   The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, and since *para* is blocked, it directs *ortho*.\n    *   The -SO₃H group is a *m*-director, and it also directs to the position *ortho* to the -tBu group.\n    This step successfully creates an intermediate with the crucial *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups.\n\n**Conclusion:** Although the later steps (iv-ix) in option A appear jumbled and may contain typos, the initial strategy (steps i-iii) is the **only one** presented that correctly solves the main chemical problem of forcing substitution ortho to a bulky tert-butyl group. In multiple-choice chemistry questions, you must identify the sequence that contains the correct core strategy, even if the full sequence is imperfectly written.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's assign the positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: -OEt (ethoxy group), a strong activator and ortho, para-director.\n*   Position 2: -tBu (tert-butyl group), a weak activator and ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, strongly favoring para-substitution.\n*   Position 3: -NO2 (nitro group), a strong deactivator and meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3-arrangement. This is a sterically crowded pattern that is often difficult to achieve through standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, which typically favor 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns depending on the directing groups. A successful synthesis will likely require a careful ordering of reactions and possibly the use of blocking groups.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group is an o,p-director, but strongly favors substitution at the para position due to sterics. The major product is 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The ortho isomer is a minor product. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would not rely on a minor product. Let's assume we proceed with the major para-isomer.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylaniline.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The -NH2 is at C1, -tBu at C4. Both -NH3+ and -tBu direct substitution to the C2 position. Product: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium salt.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene.\nThis final product has a 1,2,4 substitution pattern, which is not the desired 1,2,3 target molecule. Therefore, option A is incorrect. The final two steps (viii, ix) are also superfluous.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThe sequence of reagents is nonsensical. For example, step (iv) is `NaNO2/HCl`, which is used for diazotization of an amine. However, the substrate after step (iii) (5-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid) is not an amine. The reduction step (`Fe/HCl`) appears much later at step (viii). This option is chemically illogical and incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option employs a blocking group strategy, which is often necessary for synthesizing complex substitution patterns.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene. (High yield)\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the para position. → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. This step effectively \"blocks\" the para position. (High yield)\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a meta-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6). → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (High yield, good regioselectivity)\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. → 2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid salt.\nUp to this point, the synthesis is logical and proceeds with high yield and selectivity, producing a key intermediate. The remaining steps must transform this intermediate into the final product. The sequence as written has some ambiguities or potential typos (e.g., step vi, `HNO3/H2SO4`, seems out of place). However, let's analyze the necessary transformations and see if the provided reagents can accomplish them in a plausible (even if reordered) sequence.\nWe need to:\n1.  Replace the diazonium group (-N2+) with an ethoxy group (-OEt). This is typically done by converting it to a phenol (`H3O+, H2O/Heat` - step vii) and then performing a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr` - step ix).\n2.  Introduce a nitro group at the correct position (C3 in the final product). This requires nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4` - step vi).\n3.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group (-SO3H). This is done by heating with dilute acid (`dilute H2SO4` - step viii).\n\nA plausible (though not explicitly written in the correct order in the option) continuation would be:\n1.  Start with 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (after step iv).\n2.  Protect the amine (e.g., acetylation, an implied step).\n3.  Nitrate. The directing groups would place the NO2 group at C6 (relative to the amine).\n4.  Deprotect the amine.\n5.  Remove the sulfonic acid group (desulfonation).\n6.  Diazotize the amine, convert to phenol, then etherify.\nThis is getting very complicated. However, compared to the other options, option C presents the most viable synthetic strategy, using a blocking group to control regiochemistry. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental (wrong product, failed reaction, nonsensical order). Therefore, option C is the best choice among the given possibilities, assuming some ambiguity or error in the statement of the later steps. It correctly identifies the key strategic elements for constructing a complex aromatic molecule.\n\nFinal Decision: Options A, B, and D are clearly incorrect due to producing the wrong isomer, a failed reaction, or an illogical sequence. Option C provides the only rational strategic framework (using a blocking group) to potentially access the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern, making it the most plausible answer despite the confusing ordering of its final steps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequences to determine the correct option for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### Target Molecule Analysis\n\n*   **Structure:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy): Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl): Activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Substitution Pattern (1,2,3):**\n    *   The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The ethoxy and nitro groups are *meta* to each other.\n    *   The tert-butyl and nitro groups are *ortho* to each other.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\nThe key challenges are the *meta* relationship between the powerful ortho/para-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group, and achieving the crowded 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. Direct nitration of a molecule containing an ethoxy group would not place the nitro group in the meta position. This suggests the ethoxy group is formed late in the synthesis from a precursor that directs differently or that its directing influence is overcome.\n\nA common and versatile method to introduce a hydroxyl group (a precursor to the ethoxy group) is via the diazotization of an aniline (-NH2), followed by hydrolysis. The aniline itself is typically formed by the reduction of a nitro group. This suggests the following transformation is likely part of the synthesis: -NH2 → -N2+ → -OH → -OEt.\n\nIf this is the case, the key intermediate to synthesize is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n### Evaluation of Synthetic Pathways to 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline and the final product.\n\nLet's evaluate the most plausible synthesis route based on the reactions provided in the options, even if the options themselves appear scrambled. A chemically sound, high-yield synthesis would proceed as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is reacted with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** To control the regiochemistry of the next step, a blocking group is introduced. Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene with fuming sulfuric acid (SO3/H2SO4) places a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) at the para position, which is sterically favored, yielding **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **Nitration:** The ring is now nitrated (HNO3/H2SO4). The tert-butyl group directs ortho (since para is blocked), and the sulfonic acid group directs meta. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (ortho to the tert-butyl group), giving **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Desulfonation (Removal of Blocking Group):** The sulfonic acid group is removed by heating with dilute sulfuric acid, yielding **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene** (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene). This blocking/deblocking sequence is a standard method to obtain the ortho isomer in high yield, which is normally the minor product of direct nitration.\n5.  **Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine using a reducing agent like iron in hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl), producing **o-tert-butylaniline** (2-tert-butylaniline).\n6.  **Second Nitration:** This is a crucial and non-obvious step. Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline, under carefully controlled conditions, can yield **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. While the amino group is a strong ortho/para director (favoring positions 4 and 6), and the tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director (favoring positions 3 and 5), a combination of steric hindrance at position 3 and reaction control allows for the formation of the desired 3-nitro isomer.\n7.  **Diazotization:** The amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+) using sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid (NaNO2/HCl).\n8.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol by heating with an aqueous acidic solution (H3O+), forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** Finally, the phenol is converted to the target ethoxy ether by reaction with a base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and an ethylating agent like ethyl bromide (EtBr). This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Analysis of the Given Options\n\nNone of the provided options perfectly match this correct, multi-step synthesis. They appear to be scrambled or contain chemically incorrect steps. However, we must choose the best possible option. Option A contains almost all the necessary reaction types, even if they are in the wrong order. Let's analyze it as written:\n\n**Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n\n*   **Steps i-iii:** `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene -> p-tert-Butylnitrobenzene -> p-tert-Butylaniline`. This initial sequence is chemically sound but leads to the para isomer, which does not result in the correct final product via simple subsequent steps.\n*   **Step iv:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. This gives a different isomer, not the required precursor.\n*   **Steps v-vii:** `Diazotization -> Hydrolysis -> Etherification`. This sequence correctly converts an aniline to an ethoxy group.\n*   **Steps viii-ix:** `Sulfonation -> Desulfonation`. These steps are nonsensical at the end of the synthesis and strongly indicate the option is scrambled.\n\nDespite its flaws, Option A is the only one that presents the core sequence `Reduction (iii) -> Nitration (iv) -> Diazotization (v) -> Hydrolysis (vi) -> Etherification (vii)` in the correct relative order needed to transform an initial nitro compound into the final product, following the logic derived from the literature. This suggests that Option A, while poorly constructed, is the intended answer, assuming a non-high-yield synthesis of the necessary *ortho* intermediate at the beginning.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3-arrangement. Let's analyze their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring, especially with this combination of directors, is complex and requires careful planning of the reaction order.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Final Step**\n\nThe final product could be formed by adding one of the three groups last.\n*   **Adding -NO2 last (Nitration):** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. The -OEt group (strong o,p-director) would direct nitration to positions 4 and 6. The -tBu group (weak o,p-director) directs to positions 3 and 5. The powerful -OEt group would dominate, leading to products nitrated at position 4 (para) and 6 (ortho), not position 3. This route is unlikely to be high-yield.\n*   **Adding -tBu last (Alkylation):** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Both -OEt (o,p) and -NO2 (m) direct incoming electrophiles to positions 2, 4, and 6. The bulky -tBu group would likely add at position 6 or 4 to minimize steric hindrance, making the desired substitution at the crowded position 2 a minor product. This route is also unlikely to be high-yield.\n*   **Adding -OEt last (Etherification):** The precursor would be 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This would involve a standard Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH, then EtBr), which is generally a high-yield reaction. This suggests that forming the phenol is the key challenge.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Provided Options**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option. Often in such problems, there might be a typo in the question (e.g., the target molecule's name). A robust and chemically sound sequence is a strong indicator of the correct answer, even if the final product doesn't perfectly match a potentially erroneous name.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    i.   `Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3` -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    ii.  `Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)` -> The bulky -tBu group directs para. -> **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (major product).\n    iii. `Reduction (Fe/HCl)` -> **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv.  `Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)`: To control the reaction, the amine is typically protected as an acetanilide (-NHCOCH3). The -NHCOCH3 group (at position 1) and the -tBu group (at position 4) are both o,p-directors. They cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 2. -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    v.   `Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl)` -> Forms the corresponding diazonium salt.\n    vi.  `Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat)` -> Converts the diazonium salt to a phenol. -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n    vii. `Etherification (NaOH/EtBr)` -> **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    \n    This sequence is chemically sound and each step is logical and typically high-yield. However, it produces a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, not the 1,2,3-isomer specified in the name. Given the difficulty of synthesizing the 1,2,3-isomer and the clean logic of this path, it is highly probable that the target molecule's name in the question contains a typo and this is the intended answer. The remaining steps (viii, ix) are placed nonsensically at the end and are likely extraneous distractors.\n\n*   **Option B & D:** These sequences contain chemically nonsensical steps. For example, in B, step (iv) attempts to diazotize a molecule without an amine group. In D, step (vi) attempts to nitrate an unstable diazonium salt. These options are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence starts with `Nitration -> Reduction -> Alkylation`. Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline with AlCl3 forms the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director, leading to **3-tert-butylaniline**. Subsequent steps would lead to different isomers, none of which are the target, and the key nitration step would have poor regioselectivity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence A describes a logical, multi-step synthesis that is consistent with the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution and functional group interconversion. It leads cleanly to a specific isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene). The other options are either chemically flawed or would not produce a single major product. The most reasonable conclusion is that the question intended this 1,2,4-isomer as the target, making sequence A the correct choice.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the correct reaction sequence to synthesize a specific molecule.\n# I will analyze each option step-by-step to determine its chemical validity and the final product.\n\n# Analysis of Option A:\n# i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene\n# ii) Nitration -> p-tert-butylnitrobenzene (major product)\n# iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> p-tert-butylaniline\n# iv) Nitration (with protection) -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline (directing groups agree)\n# v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) -> Diazonium salt\n# vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+/Heat) -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol\n# vii) Etherification (NaOH/EtBr) -> 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene\n# This sequence is chemically sound and high-yield, although it produces an isomer of the named target.\n# It is the most plausible sequence among the choices, suggesting a typo in the problem's target name.\n\n# Analysis of Option B:\n# Step iv) NaNO2/HCl is for diazotizing an amine, but the substrate from step iii) is a sulfonic acid.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Relative Positions:** The groups are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern. This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nTo achieve a high-yield synthesis, the directing effects of the substituents must be carefully controlled, often using activating/deactivating properties and blocking groups.\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Moderately activating, ortho/para director. Very bulky, so it often directs to the para position.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino):** Strongly activating, ortho/para director. (Common intermediate).\n*   **-SO3H (Sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta director. Crucially, it's a reversible group (can be removed with dilute acid and heat), making it an excellent **blocking group**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe goal is to find a sequence that logically and efficiently places the three groups in the correct 1,2,3 orientation. Synthesizing such a crowded molecule often requires a blocking group strategy to force substituents into positions they would not normally occupy.\n\nLet's analyze the beginning of each sequence, as this is the most critical part for setting up the regiochemistry.\n\n*   **Sequence A:**\n    *   i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → The Lewis acid AlCl3 complexes with the -NH2 group, converting it into a deactivating, meta-directing group (-NH2+-AlCl3). This correctly yields **3-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) Nitration of 3-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 group (activating, o,p director) and -tBu group (activating, o,p director) cooperatively direct to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 is highly sterically hindered. The major products would be 4-nitro and 6-nitro isomers, not the required 2-nitro isomer. This path fails to provide a high yield.\n\n*   **Sequence B:**\n    *   i) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → The bulky t-butyl group strongly directs nitration to the para position, yielding mainly **4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   iii) 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → The ring is deactivated, but both groups direct to position 2 (ortho to t-Bu, meta to NO2), yielding **4-nitro-2-sulfo-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   iv) + NaNO2/HCl → This reagent is for diazotizing an amine (-NH2). The current molecule has a nitro group (-NO2). This step is chemically impossible. The sequence fails.\n\n*   **Sequence C:**\n    *   The sequence of reagents seems illogical. For instance, sulfonation (viii) and desulfonation (ix) are placed near the end, after several other transformations have occurred, which makes no strategic sense for a blocking group. The entire sequence is out of order.\n\n*   **Sequence D:**\n    *   i) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → The bulky t-butyl group directs sulfonation to the less hindered para position. This forms **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic blocking group strategy, protecting the para position.\n    *   iii) 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → Now we nitrate. The -tBu group is an o,p director, and the -SO3H group is a meta director.\n        *   -tBu (at pos 1) directs to positions 2 and 6.\n        *   -SO3H (at pos 4) directs to positions 2 and 6.\n        *   Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 2 (or 6, which is equivalent). This yields **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield. This intermediate correctly establishes the required ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups.\n    *   iv) + Fe/HCl → The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   v) + NaNO2/HCl → The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    *   The subsequent steps (vi-ix) are listed in a confusing or incorrect order, likely due to typos in the question. However, the initial steps (i-iii) represent the most logical and effective strategy among all options for creating the necessary 1,2-disubstituted pattern (t-Bu and NO2 ortho to each other) by using a sulfonic acid blocking group. No other option presents a viable high-yield path. Despite the apparent errors in the later steps, the core strategy of Sequence D is the most sound. It establishes the critical ortho relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups, which is essential for forming the final product. The subsequent steps would involve replacing the sulfonic acid and the diazonium group with the required ethoxy group and then re-introducing a nitro group in the correct location, or a similar series of transformations. The beginning of sequence D is the only one that correctly sets up the key structural feature.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence D outlines the most plausible synthetic strategy, especially in its initial steps, which employ a blocking group to correctly establish the ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and a future nitro group. While the full sequence as written has errors, its strategic foundation is superior to the other options, which contain more fundamental chemical impossibilities or low-yield steps early on.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe user wants to identify the correct multi-step synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure**: The target molecule is a benzene ring with three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: The numbering indicates a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Director Effects of Substituents**:\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene**: This is a standard electrophilic nitration.\nii) **Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline**: This is the standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\niii) **Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → 2-tert-butylaniline**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. While this reaction is problematic on aniline (the Lewis acid catalyst complexes with the basic amine) and the major product would be the *para* isomer due to steric hindrance, the formation of the required *ortho* isomer is theoretically possible, even if in low yield.\niv) **2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**: This is a nitration step. In the strong acid medium, the amine (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -NH3+ group at C1 directs the incoming nitro group to C3. The bulky tert-butyl group at C2 would also favor substitution away from it. This step correctly places the nitro group at the desired C3 position.\nv) **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylbenzenediazonium salt**: This is a standard diazotization reaction of the primary amine.\nvi) & vii) **SO3/H2SO4** and **dilute H2SO4**: These steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are superfluous and don't contribute to the main synthetic pathway. They are likely included as distractors.\nviii) **Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**: The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) upon heating in aqueous acid. This correctly places the -OH group at C1.\nix) **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide ion attacks ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ethoxy ether product.\n\n**Conclusion for A**: Despite potential low yields in steps (iii) and (iv) and the presence of extraneous steps (vi, vii), this sequence is the only one that logically leads to the correct 1,2,3-substitution pattern of the target molecule.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) **tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**: The tert-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but due to its large size, the *para* product is heavily favored.\nThis pathway will lead to a 1,4-disubstituted intermediate, making it impossible to achieve the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted final product. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nThe order of reactions is synthetically incorrect. For instance, step (iv) calls for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) on the product from step (iii), which is a sulfonic acid derivative. Diazotization requires a primary amino group, which is not present at that stage. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence is also synthetically flawed. For example, step (v) calls for diazotization on a molecule that has no amino group. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Final Verdict**\nOption A is the only chemically plausible route among the choices provided. Although the question mentions \"high-yield,\" which might not be accurate for all steps, it represents the correct logical progression of reactions to achieve the desired isomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nAn evaluation of the reaction sequences is necessary to determine the one that results in the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern (ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro), which is sterically crowded and requires a carefully planned synthetic route.\n\n### Analysis of the Synthetic Options:\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence attempts to use a sulfonic acid group as a directing group.\n    1.  `i)` Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  `ii)` Sulfonation blocks the para position, yielding 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.\n    3.  `iii)` Nitration occurs ortho to the tert-butyl group, giving 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    4.  `iv)` Reduction of the nitro group gives 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.\n    5.  `v)` Diazotization converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  `vi)` The addition of `HNO3/H2SO4` to a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical synthetic step, making this pathway incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence has a fatal flaw in its ordering. Step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) is attempted before step `viii) Fe/HCl` (reduction of a nitro group to an amine). Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine, which has not yet been formed. Therefore, this sequence is impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins by forming aniline, then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on rings with strongly deactivating groups, and the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) would react with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and directing substitution to the meta position. This would lead to the wrong isomer and is an invalid step.\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene occurs. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the para product is major, but the ortho product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is also formed. While this step may not be high-yield for the ortho isomer, the sequence proceeds with this intermediate.\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: This step involves the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is a very strong ortho, para-director. The para position is already occupied by the bulky tert-butyl group. Of the two available ortho positions (3 and 6), position 6 is sterically hindered by the adjacent tert-butyl group. Therefore, the incoming nitro group is directed to position 3, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a known regioselective reaction.\n    5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt via diazotization.\n    6.  `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, which forms **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis. The NaOH deprotonates the hydroxyl group, and the resulting phenoxide ion reacts with ethyl bromide to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe sequence of steps `i` through `vii` in option B correctly describes a valid, albeit potentially low-yield in one step, synthesis of the target molecule. The final two steps, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are extraneous and would perform a sulfonation and then a desulfonation on the final product, which serves no purpose. Their inclusion is likely an error in the question's option listing. However, compared to the other options which contain chemically impossible or incorrect steps, the core synthetic route of Option B is the only one that logically leads to the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nAnswering this question requires a deep understanding of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, including the directing effects of various substituents, the use of blocking groups, and functional group interconversions. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a polysubstituted benzene with a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   The ethoxy (-OEt) group is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   The tert-butyl (-tBu) group is an activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, sterically hindering adjacent positions.\n*   The nitro (-NO2) group is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern, which is often challenging to achieve directly due to conflicting directing effects.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These sequences contain fundamental flaws.\n    *   **Option C** fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline (from step ii) is not effective. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group to form a positively charged anilinium-type complex, which strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the reaction.\n    *   **Option B** fails at step (iv). It attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (NaNO₂/HCl) on 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂), which is not present at this stage.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is chemically logical, but it produces the wrong isomer.\n    1.  **Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **tert-Butylbenzene → p-tert-Butylnitrobenzene:** Nitration. The para product is major due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group.\n    3.  **p-tert-Butylnitrobenzene → p-tert-Butylaniline:** Reduction of the nitro group.\n    4.  **p-tert-Butylaniline → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitroaniline:** Nitration. The amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. Both the -tBu (o,p) and -NH₃⁺ (m) groups direct nitration to the position ortho to the t-butyl group.\n    5.  **Diazotization →** Converts the -NH₂ group into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    6.  **Hydrolysis (H₃O⁺/Heat) →** Replaces the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to give 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.\n    7.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) →** Converts the -OH group to an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n    The final product of this sequence is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. This is the 1,2,4-isomer, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is the most complex and contains a step that appears chemically incorrect as written, but it is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze its strategy.\n    1.  **Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts.\n    2.  **tert-Butylbenzene → p-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** Sulfonation. The -SO₃H group acts as a blocking group, occupying the para position which is sterically favored for substitution.\n    3.  **Nitration → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** With the para position blocked, nitration is directed by the o,p-directing t-butyl group to the open ortho position.\n    4.  **Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine.\n    5.  **Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) →** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    \n    At this point, we have established a 1,2,4 relationship between the t-butyl, diazonium, and sulfonic acid groups. The subsequent steps (vi-ix) must transform this into the final 1,2,3 product. Step (vi), nitration of a heavily deactivated diazonium salt, is highly problematic and likely a typo. However, the overall strategy involving blocking the para position, introducing groups ortho, and then using a series of transformations (reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, desulfonation, etherification) is a powerful and necessary approach for synthesizing highly substituted, sterically hindered molecules like the target. By eliminating options B, C, and D based on more definitive flaws (failed reaction or wrong product), option A remains the only plausible, albeit imperfect, choice. It is the only sequence that attempts the kind of complex maneuvering required for such a synthesis.\n\nTherefore, despite a likely error in the description of step (vi), the overall synthetic plan outlined in Option A is the most likely to be the intended correct answer for achieving the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's dissect its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relative positions of the substituents are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with the bulky tert-butyl group flanked by two other groups, suggests a complex synthesis is required, likely involving careful control of directing effects, possibly with blocking groups.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of the groups (or their precursors) in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, ortho/para-director. Bulky, so it strongly favors the para position.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Precursor to -OEt. Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Precursor to -OH (via diazotization). Very strongly activating, ortho/para-director. In strong acid, it becomes **-NH3+**, which is deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Deactivating, meta-director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze the provided options. Many of the sequences as written contain chemically incorrect ordering of steps (e.g., diazotization before forming an amine). We must identify the most plausible intended chemical pathway. We will analyze the sequence in option D, which is the most coherent series of reaction *types*, assuming potential typos in the exact ordering.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThe listed reagents suggest a specific strategy. Let's trace the reaction step-by-step, assuming we start with the major product at each stage to ensure a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Product: **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-Butylbenzene**: This is nitration. The -tBu group is an ortho, para-director, but due to its large steric bulk, the major product is overwhelmingly the para isomer.\n    *   Major Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**: This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Product: **p-tert-butylaniline** (4-tert-butylaniline).\n\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on p-tert-butylaniline**: This is another nitration step. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   We are nitrating the **p-tert-butyl anilinium ion**.\n    *   The -NH3+ group is a deactivating meta-director. It directs incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5 (meta to itself).\n    *   The -tBu group is an activating ortho, para-director. It directs to positions 2 and 6 (ortho to itself).\n    *   The positions ortho to the -tBu group (2 and 6) are also meta to the -NH3+ group. Therefore, the directing effects of both groups reinforce each other, guiding the incoming nitro group (NO2+) to position 2 (or 6, which is equivalent).\n    *   Product: **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**: This is the diazotization of the primary amino group.\n    *   Product: **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: This reaction involves heating the diazonium salt in an aqueous acidic solution, which hydrolyzes it to a phenol.\n    *   Product: **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol to form a phenoxide ion, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack the ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether.\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**: These final two steps as listed are chemically illogical. Sulfonating a finished product and then immediately removing the sulfonic acid group (desulfonation) would be redundant and inefficient. This suggests a likely typo in the option's construction.\n\n**Conclusion of the Analysis**\n\nThe logical sequence of reactions (i through vii) in option D leads to the synthesis of **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. Let's compare this with the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Product of sequence D**: Substituents at C1(-OEt), C2(-NO2), C4(-tBu).\n*   **Target Molecule**: Substituents at C1(-OEt), C2(-tBu), C3(-NO2).\n\nThese are different constitutional isomers. However, when comparing the four options, options A, B, and C contain more severe logical flaws in the ordering of fundamental reactions (e.g., attempting diazotization before reduction to an amine). The sequence of reaction *types* in option D (alkylation, nitration, reduction, further substitution, functional group conversion) is the most plausible and represents a valid, coherent synthesis of a complex trisubstituted benzene, despite yielding an isomer of the named target. In the context of a multiple-choice question that is likely flawed, option D represents the \"best\" and most chemically sound synthetic plan among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy group) at position 1. This is a strong activating group and an *ortho, para* director.\n    *   -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl group) at position 2. This is a weak activating group and an *ortho, para* director.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro group) at position 3. This is a strong deactivating group and a *meta* director.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,2,3, which is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   Relative positions:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires careful control of directing effects, possibly using blocking groups or functional group interconversions. The presence of reagents like `NaNO2/HCl` in the options strongly suggests that a diazotization reaction of an amine is involved. The amine (-NH2) is often derived from the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2). The final ethoxy group (-OEt) is typically formed by Williamson ether synthesis from a phenol (-OH).\n\n**3. Analyze the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on standard principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n    *   Step iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. This reaction does not work as intended. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-). This complex is strongly deactivating and a *meta* director, leading to the wrong product isomer and low yields. Thus, **Option D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   This sequence contains several inconsistencies. For example, step (viii) is a reduction (Fe/HCl), but the likely intermediate before this step (based on the preceding reagents like `NaOH/EtBr`) would be an ether, which has no nitro group to be reduced at this stage. Also, having a reduction followed immediately by a nitration is unusual. The sequence of reagents is not logical. Thus, **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This sequence attempts to use sulfonation as a blocking strategy.\n    *   i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Sulfonation -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocks the *para* position).\n    *   iii) Nitration -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This correctly establishes an *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and a nitro group.\n    *   iv) Reduction -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   v) Diazotization -> [2-sulfo-4-tert-butyl-phenyldiazonium salt].\n    *   vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`. This step is problematic. Applying nitrating acid to a diazonium salt is not a standard synthetic transformation. This step makes the entire sequence chemically invalid as written. Thus, **Option C is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   Let's trace this path carefully. This sequence is long but follows a logical progression of functional group transformations.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the bulky t-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. This is a high-yield reaction.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. Direct nitration of anilines is problematic (oxidation). The standard procedure involves protecting the amine as an acetamide (-NHCOCH3), performing the nitration, and then deprotecting. Assuming this is done, the strong *ortho, para*-directing acetamido group will direct the nitro group to its *ortho* position (position 2). This yields **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group to form the **[4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenyldiazonium] salt**.\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **viii) SO3/H2SO4** and **ix) dilute H2SO4**: This is a sulfonation followed by a desulfonation.\n\n    **Evaluation of Option B:** The sequence of steps (i) through (vii) is a chemically sound and high-yield synthesis for the specific isomer **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is not the target molecule named in the question. However, Options A, C, and D contain fundamentally incorrect chemical steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a valid synthesis. The final two steps (viii, ix) are often used to isomerize a compound to its most thermodynamically stable form. While it is highly unlikely that this process would convert the 1,2,4-isomer into the more sterically hindered 1,2,3-target isomer, Option B is the only one that is not outright incorrect from a chemical reaction standpoint. Given the likely flaws in the question (either the target name or the options), Option B represents the \"best\" and most chemically plausible synthetic route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThis problem requires us to identify the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. We must evaluate each proposed synthetic pathway based on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution and functional group transformations.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe target product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It is a tri-substituted benzene ring with the substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Weakly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. Its large size sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options\n\n**Option A:**\n1.  `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n2.  `ii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n3.  `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction **fails** when attempted on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired alkylation.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis option attempts to use a blocking group strategy.\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  `ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The sulfonic acid group will add to the *para* position, forming 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n3.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration occurs *ortho* to the t-Bu group, yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This creates a 1,2,4-substitution pattern. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern. This route will not produce the correct isomer. Furthermore, step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is not a standard reaction for a diazonium salt.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitrates tert-butylbenzene.\n3.  `iii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonates the product from step ii.\n4.  `iv) NaNO2/HCl`: This is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate at this point does not have an amino group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\nThis sequence is the only remaining possibility. Let's verify its chemical logic.\n1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Alkylation of benzene gives **tert-butylbenzene**. Correct.\n2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. While the *para* isomer is the major product, the desired **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** is also formed and can be isolated.\n3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: Reduction of the nitro group in o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene yields **o-tert-butylaniline**. Correct.\n4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline. In the strongly acidic conditions, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an activator and *o,p*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to the C3 position. This is a highly regioselective step that yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the primary amine to form a diazonium salt. Correct.\n6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. Correct.\n7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide to form the final ether product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Correct.\nThe remaining steps (viii and ix) are superfluous, but the core synthesis (i-vii) is chemically sound and represents the only viable route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's analyze the substituents and their relative positions:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Bulky, so para-substitution is often favored over ortho.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Can be converted to -OH and other groups via a diazonium salt.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Precursor to -OEt.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nThe goal is to introduce these three groups in the correct positions. Achieving a 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging and may require multi-step strategies involving blocking groups or modification of functional groups. Let's evaluate each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction generally fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, Option A is not a viable high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence starts with tert-butylation of benzene, followed by nitration. This would primarily yield p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step (iv) is diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) (sulfonation of p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) does not have an amino group. The reduction step (Fe/HCl) is listed much later (viii). The sequence as written is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence uses a sulfonic acid group. Let's trace the likely products:\n        *   i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene.\n        *   ii) Sulfonation -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para due to sterics).\n        *   iii) Nitration -> The -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) groups both direct the incoming -NO2 to the position ortho to the -tBu group. Product: 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) of -NO2 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   At this stage, we have the -tBu group and the precursor to our -OEt group (the -NH2) in a *meta* relationship (at positions 4 and 2 respectively). The target molecule requires these groups to be *ortho*. This pathway will not lead to the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   This sequence is complex and involves many steps. Let's analyze the most logical pathway using these reagents, which may not be the strict written order, to see if the target can be formed. A common strategy for complex substitution patterns is to build a core structure and then use blocking groups to direct the final substitution.\n    *   **Part 1: Building the 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene core.**\n        1.  `i) Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)-->` tert-butylbenzene.\n        2.  `ii) tert-butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. While the para isomer is major, the ortho isomer is formed and can be separated. A high-yield synthesis might require an alternative route to this intermediate, but among the given options, this is a necessary starting point for an ortho-disubstituted product.\n        3.  `iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene --(Fe/HCl)-->` o-tert-butylaniline. The nitro group is reduced to an amine.\n        4.  The amine group can be converted into an ethoxy group:\n            *   `v) o-tert-butylaniline --(NaNO2/HCl)-->` Diazotization to form a diazonium salt.\n            *   `vi) Diazonium salt --(H3O+/Heat)-->` Hydrolysis to form 2-tert-butylphenol.\n            *   `vii) 2-tert-butylphenol --(NaOH/EtBr)-->` Williamson ether synthesis to form **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Part 2: Introducing the nitro group at the correct position.**\n        *   We now have the correct ortho relationship between the -OEt and -tBu groups. We need to introduce a -NO2 group at position 3.\n        *   Direct nitration of 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene is problematic. Both -OEt and -tBu are o,p-directors, so they would direct nitration to positions 4 and 6, not 3.\n        *   This is where the blocking group reagents `(viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `(ix) dilute H2SO4` become crucial.\n        5.  `viii) 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene --(SO3/H2SO4)-->` Sulfonation. The most activated and sterically accessible position is C4 (para to the strong activator -OEt). This blocks position 4. Product: **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n        6.  `iv) Nitrate the blocked intermediate --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` Now, we nitrate. The available positions for substitution are 3, 5, and 6. Let's analyze the directing effects on the remaining positions:\n            *   -OEt (at C1) directs to C6.\n            *   -tBu (at C2) directs to C6.\n            *   -SO3H (at C4) directs to C6.\n            *   All groups strongly direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to position 6.\n            *   However, to form the target product, nitration must occur at position 3. Position 3 is meta to the -OEt group (electronically disfavored) but ortho to the -tBu group. While standard rules predict substitution at position 6, complex steric and electronic interactions in highly substituted rings can sometimes lead to unusual regioselectivity. Given that this is a multiple-choice question and other options are clearly flawed, this pathway represents the most strategically sound approach, assuming the desired, albeit unusual, nitration at position 3 occurs to yield **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n        7.  `ix) Desulfonation --(dilute H2SO4)-->` The final step is to remove the sulfonic acid blocking group by heating with dilute acid. This reveals the final target molecule: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the nitration in step 6 is not the outcome predicted by simple rules, the overall strategy presented by the reagents in Option D is the most chemically sophisticated and plausible for achieving the complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern. The use of a minor isomer from an early step, followed by conversion of functional groups and a blocking group strategy, is a hallmark of advanced organic synthesis. The other options contain chemically invalid steps or lead definitively to the wrong isomeric skeleton. Therefore, Option D outlines the correct sequence of reactions required.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThe initial analysis of the reaction options proved challenging, as standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) rules do not obviously lead to the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted product in high yield. Synthesizing such compounds can be complex, often requiring non-obvious strategies like blocking groups or directing group manipulation. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key precursor to this ether is likely 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol, which would be converted to the final product via a Williamson ether synthesis (using a base like NaOH and an ethylating agent like EtBr).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the provided options by tracing the intermediates, keeping in mind that one of them must represent a viable, high-yield pathway.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which produces **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** This is a nitration reaction. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A high-yield synthesis would proceed using this major product.\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene:** This reaction reduces the nitro group to an amine, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 4-tert-butylaniline:** This is the nitration of an aniline derivative. In the strongly acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a deactivating, *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an activating, *ortho, para*-director. The directing effects of the two groups are cooperative:\n    *   The -tBu group at position 1 directs ortho, to positions 2 and 6.\n    *   The -NH3+ group at position 4 directs meta, to positions 2 and 6.\n    Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (position 2). This results in the high-yield formation of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline:** This step converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt. The product is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Heating an aqueous acidic solution of a diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This forms **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to displace the bromide from ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether. The product is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, it is clear that this reaction sequence (Option D) produces an isomer of the desired product, not the target molecule 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. There seems to be an issue with all the provided options, as none follow a standard, logical pathway to the target molecule in high yield.\n\nHowever, if we are forced to choose the \"best\" option, we must re-examine the premises. Let's reconsider step (iv) of option D. Perhaps the naming of the final compound is based on the IUPAC priority of the ethoxy group, which would renumber the ring. Let's check the final product from Option D: 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. This is a 1,2,4 substitution pattern, which is different from the target's 1,2,3 pattern.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in the question's options and re-evaluate the most plausible synthetic route from scratch, which often involves a blocking group strategy that none of the options correctly represent.\n\nA plausible, though not listed, synthesis might be:\n1.  **t-Butylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  **Sulfonation:** -> 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocks the para position).\n3.  **Nitration:** -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n4.  **Reduction of Nitro:** -> 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n5.  **Removal of Sulfonic Acid Group:** (e.g., via diazotization followed by reduction with H3PO2, not straightforward) to get 3-tert-butylaniline. This is already convoluted.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, let's reconsider the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline from my initial scratchpad analysis.\n1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  Nitration -> *o*-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene (minor isomer, but let's assume it's isolated for this hypothetical path).\n3.  Reduction -> 2-tert-Butylaniline.\n4.  Nitration: If we could somehow force nitration at position 3, we would get 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n5.  Diazotization -> Diazonium salt.\n6.  Hydrolysis -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n7.  Etherification -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nThis path is also flawed due to the difficulty of the nitration step (step 4).\n\n**Conclusion based on elimination**\n\n*   Options A and B involve sulfonation steps that lead to incorrect isomers.\n*   Option C starts with nitration, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which is problematic and leads to meta-alkylation, not the required ortho-substitution.\n*   Option D provides a chemically sound sequence of reactions that proceeds via major isomers and cooperative directing effects. However, it leads to the wrong final isomer: 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene instead of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that there is an error in the question or the provided options, as none of them correctly synthesize the target compound in high yield. However, if a choice must be made, Option D represents the most logical and regiochemically controlled sequence of reactions, even though its final product is incorrectly named or is an isomer of the target. Without a viable alternative, and acknowledging the discrepancy, none of the choices are correct. If this is a multiple-choice question from a source, there may be an error in the source material itself.\n\nSince I must choose from the given options, and none perfectly match, I cannot provide a definitive correct answer. The process of elimination reveals fatal flaws in A, B, and C. Option D is the most synthetically sound pathway, but it leads to the wrong isomer.\n\nGiven the constraints, no option is correct. However, if forced to select the \"most plausible\" chemical sequence despite the incorrect final product, Option D is the strongest contender in terms of regiochemical control. This highlights a likely error in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nMy initial analysis of the reaction sequence in option C led to the incorrect isomer, 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, instead of the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. This discrepancy suggests a potential flaw in the proposed reaction pathway or an incorrect interpretation of the directing effects of the substituents under the specified conditions. Let's re-evaluate the synthesis from a different perspective, keeping the target molecule's structure—with its ortho/meta relationships—at the forefront.\n\nThe target has an ethoxy and a nitro group *meta* to each other, and a *tert*-butyl group *ortho* to both. This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is notoriously difficult to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution, which typically favors ortho/para or meta products, not a mix. This often requires a more complex strategy, sometimes involving blocking groups or rearrangement of substituent positions.\n\nLet's meticulously re-examine the sequence in Option C, which remains the most plausible choice after eliminating the other options due to clear chemical impossibilities (e.g., diazotization without an amine, Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring).\n\n**Re-evaluation of Option C:**\n\n1.  **i) `tert`-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ on benzene:** This yields `tert`-butylbenzene. This step is sound.\n2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ on `tert`-butylbenzene:** Standard nitration. The `tert`-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to significant steric hindrance, the major product is *p*-nitro-`tert`-butylbenzene, with *o*-nitro-`tert`-butylbenzene as a minor product. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, relying on a minor product is inefficient. However, let's proceed with the major product, **4-`tert`-butylnitrobenzene**.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl on 4-`tert`-butylnitrobenzene:** This reduces the nitro group to an amino group, yielding **4-`tert`-butylaniline**. This is a standard and high-yield reduction.\n4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ on 4-`tert`-butylaniline:** This is the most critical and complex step. Direct nitration of anilines is problematic; the amino group is often protected via acetylation first. Assuming the intended reaction is the nitration of protected 4-`tert`-butylaniline (N-acetyl-4-tert-butylaniline), the acetylamino group (-NHCOCH₃) is a strong ortho, para-director. The `tert`-butyl group is also an ortho, para-director. The directing effects cooperate, and nitration occurs *ortho* to the powerfully directing acetylamino group. This gives **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitroacetanilide**, which is then hydrolyzed to **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This intermediate is a known compound.\n5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl on 4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitroaniline:** This step converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, yielding **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**. This is a standard diazotization.\n6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Heating an aqueous solution of the diazonium salt replaces the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This produces **4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrophenol:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The strongly basic NaOH deprotonates the phenolic -OH group, and the resulting phenoxide ion attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The product is **1-ethoxy-4-`tert`-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis detailed analysis confirms that the sequence in option C produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule but not the target molecule itself. The substituent positions are (1-OEt, 2-NO₂, 4-tBu) instead of the required (1-OEt, 2-tBu, 3-NO₂).\n\nGiven that options A, B, and D contain chemically flawed steps, and option C leads to an isomer, there appears to be an error in the question or the provided options. No sequence listed correctly and efficiently produces 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question where one option must be the best fit despite potential inaccuracies, let's consider if there is any alternative, albeit less common, reaction pathway that could be implied. It's highly unlikely. The regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution is fundamental, and the outcome of the sequence in C is quite clear.\n\nSince the prompt requires selecting the best option among the given choices, and options A, B, and D are definitively incorrect due to misplaced or impossible reactions, option C represents the most chemically logical (though ultimately flawed in its outcome) sequence of reactions for synthesizing a trisubstituted nitro-ethoxy-tert-butyl-benzene. It follows a common synthetic logic: introduce directing groups, perform substitutions, and then modify the functional groups (nitro reduction, diazotization, hydroxyl substitution, etherification). The error lies in the regiochemical outcome, not the logic of the steps themselves. Therefore, it is the \"least wrong\" answer.\n\nFinal conclusion based on eliminating the impossible options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThe correct sequence of reactions to achieve the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene is outlined in option A. Let's analyze the steps to understand why this sequence is the most effective.\n\nThe target molecule is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring with an ethoxy group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group. The key to this synthesis is establishing the correct relative positions of the substituents, which requires careful control of the directing effects of the groups at each stage.\n\n1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃):** The first step is the alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director for subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n    `Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene`\n\n2.  **ii) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the *para* product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is typically major. However, to arrive at the 1,2,3-substituted final product, the *ortho* isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) must be carried forward. For a high-yield synthesis, this implies that the isomers are separated at this stage.\n    `tert-Butylbenzene → 1-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzene`\n\n3.  **iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group using iron in acidic medium. This transforms the nitrobenzene derivative into an aniline.\n    `1-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzene → 2-(tert-butyl)aniline`\n\n4.  **iv) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** This is the crucial step for setting up the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. In the strong acid mixture, the amino group of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The anilinium ion is a deactivating, *meta*-director, while the tert-butyl group remains an *ortho, para*-director. The directing effects of both groups now converge on the C3 and C5 positions. This allows for the successful nitration at the C3 position, which is *meta* to the anilinium group and *ortho* to the tert-butyl group.\n    `2-(tert-butyl)aniline → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline`\n\n5.  **v) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl):** The primary amino group of 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction for transforming an amino group into a variety of other functional groups.\n    `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride`\n\n6.  **vi) Hydrolysis (H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat):** The diazonium salt is gently heated in aqueous acid to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol.\n    `Diazonium salt → 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`\n\n7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is first deprotonated by sodium hydroxide to form a more nucleophilic sodium phenoxide. This phenoxide then reacts with an ethyl halide (ethyl bromide) in an Sₙ2 reaction to form the final ether product.\n    `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`\n\nThe subsequent steps listed in option A, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, are superfluous as the target molecule has already been synthesized. Their inclusion does not invalidate the correctness of the preceding sequence. The other options (B, C, and D) contain chemically incorrect steps, such as attempting to form a diazonium salt without an amine or nitrating a diazonium salt directly. Therefore, option A describes the only viable synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   The ethoxy group and the tert-butyl group are *ortho* to each other.\n*   The tert-butyl group and the nitro group are *ortho* to each other.\n*   The ethoxy group and the nitro group are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. Very bulky, so it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It can be added and removed, making it an excellent blocking group.\n\n**The Synthetic Challenge:**\nThe main challenge is establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with two *ortho, para*-directing groups (-OEt, -tBu) located *ortho* to each other. Direct electrophilic substitution to create this arrangement is very difficult due to steric hindrance and directing effects. For example, nitrating 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene would add the nitro group at positions 4 or 6, not position 3. This indicates that a more complex strategy involving blocking groups or functional group interconversions is required.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration) -> Nitrobenzene\nii) Fe/HCl (Reduction) -> Aniline\niii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation): This reaction is problematic with aniline. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form anilinium (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. This leads to poor yields and incorrect regiochemistry. This option is not viable.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration) -> This gives a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product (>70%), making this a low-yield step for any synthesis requiring the *ortho* isomer.\niv) NaNO2/HCl: This reagent is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The product from step (iii) (a nitro-sulfonic acid) does not have an amino group. This step is chemically incorrect in this position. This option is flawed.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence starts similarly to C by creating a mixture of ortho/para isomers, which is not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. Following the path with the minor *ortho*-isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), subsequent reduction, nitration, diazotization, and other steps lead to 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, which is the wrong isomer.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis sequence employs a more sophisticated strategy using a blocking group. Let's analyze it step-by-step.\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** Sulfonation. The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming -SO3H group almost exclusively to the *para* position. This blocks the para position.\n*   **iii) 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, and the -SO3H group is a *m*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the t-butyl group (C2). This is a powerful strategy to force ortho-substitution.\n*   **iv) 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amino group.\n*   **v) 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → 4-tert-Butyl-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonate:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n*   **vi) ... + HNO3/H2SO4:** This step is unusual. If interpreted as nitration, it would occur on a highly deactivated ring. The most plausible interpretation in the context of creating the target is that a series of transformations begins, using the remaining reagents. Let's assume there is a specific, albeit perhaps non-obvious, sequence of reactions involving the remaining reagents that leads to the target.\n*   **vii) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This reagent cocktail replaces a diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **viii) ... + dilute H2SO4:** This is the standard condition for desulfonation (removal of the -SO3H group).\n*   **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr:** This is the Williamson ether synthesis, which converts a phenol (-OH) into an ether (-OEt).\n\nAlthough the exact sequence and regiochemical outcome of steps vi-viii are complex and may involve non-standard reactions or specific conditions, the overall strategy presented in option A is the most chemically sound. It correctly addresses the main synthetic challenge of achieving the required ortho-substitution by using a blocking group. The other options contain more fundamental and insurmountable flaws (e.g., incorrect reactions, poor yields from the start, nonsensical reagent order). Therefore, by elimination and by recognizing the superior underlying strategy, Option A is the most plausible path.\n\nFinal logic: The blocking group strategy (steps i-iii) is the only presented method that can create the t-butyl group and nitro group ortho to each other in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-ix) are a series of functional group interconversions designed to manipulate this intermediate into the final product. While the specific order might be debatable or involve complex transformations, the foundation of the synthesis in A is far superior to the other options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequences provided in the options to determine the correct path for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Directing Effects:** The relationship between the directing effects of the groups is crucial. The ethoxy group is a strong *ortho, para*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. The nitro group is a *meta*-director. Achieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern often requires a multi-step strategy involving blocking groups or manipulation of functional groups (e.g., via a Sandmeyer reaction).\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence introduces a sulfonic acid group as a blocking group, which is a good strategy. However, step (iv) reduces the nitro group to an amine (Fe/HCl), and step (vi) attempts a nitration on a diazonium salt intermediate, which is chemically unsound in this context. The sequence does not logically lead to the final product.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence begins with the nitration of benzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, this pathway is not viable for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence has a fatal flaw at step (iv). It calls for the use of NaNO₂/HCl, which is used to create a diazonium salt from a primary aromatic amine. However, the substrate at this stage, 2-(tert-butyl)-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, does not contain an amino group, making this step impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence carefully, as it represents the most plausible (though complex) synthetic route among the choices.\n    1.  **i) `tert`-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form *tert*-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of *tert*-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the *tert*-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, 1-(*tert*-butyl)-4-nitrobenzene, which allows for a high-yield separation from the minor *ortho* isomer.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-(*tert*-butyl)-4-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding 4-(*tert*-butyl)aniline.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 4-(*tert*-butyl)aniline. The amino group (-NH₂) is a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director. Since the *para* position is blocked by the *tert*-butyl group, nitration occurs at one of the equivalent *ortho* positions (C2 or C6), yielding 4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitroaniline.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The primary amino group of 4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization reaction.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by heating in aqueous acid to form a phenol, yielding 4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitrophenol.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenolic hydroxyl group is deprotonated by NaOH and then alkylated with ethyl bromide (EtBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis to form an ethoxy group. This produces 1-ethoxy-4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene.\n    8.  **viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ & ix) dilute H₂SO₄:** These final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are chemically nonsensical in this position after the target-like molecule has been synthesized and would not contribute to the formation of the desired product. It is highly probable that these steps are erroneously included in the option.\n\nHowever, when comparing the molecule synthesized through steps (i) to (vii) of option D, **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, with the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, it becomes clear they are not the same isomer. There appears to be a discrepancy between the provided options and the exact structure named in the question.\n\nGiven the common patterns in multistep synthesis problems of this nature, it is most likely that Option D describes a valid, high-yield synthesis pathway for a specific trisubstituted benzene, and it is the most chemically sound choice among the flawed alternatives, despite the final product not matching the name perfectly and the inclusion of superfluous final steps. The core of the synthesis (steps i-vii) is logical and follows established organic chemistry principles for directing group effects and functional group interconversions.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the relative positions of the substituents:\n*   The ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position 1.\n*   The tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position 2.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is at position 3.\n\nBased on this numbering:\n*   Ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2) are **ortho** to each other.\n*   tert-Butyl (2) and nitro (3) are **ortho** to each other.\n*   Ethoxy (1) and nitro (3) are **meta** to each other.\n\nA successful high-yield synthesis must install these groups in the correct positions by carefully considering their directing effects and steric hindrance.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe will evaluate each sequence of reactions:\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ...`\n    *   Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The product from step (iii) is a substituted nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, which does not have an amine group. This step is chemically incorrect in this position. Therefore, sequence A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `... ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...`\n    *   Step (ii) nitrates tert-butylbenzene, primarily at the para position. Step (iii) reduces the nitro group to an amine. Step (iv) attempts to nitrate an aniline derivative (`2-tert-butylaniline`) under strong acid conditions (`HNO3/H2SO4`). This reaction is problematic as it leads to oxidation of the amine and a mixture of products, because the amine group protonates to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. This would not be a high-yield process for the desired product. Therefore, sequence B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (product of step ii). The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amine group, deactivating the ring and preventing the alkylation. Even if the amine is protected, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work well on rings deactivated by a nitro group (from step i). Therefore, sequence D is incorrect from the start.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; ...`\n    *   This option utilizes a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a blocking group, which is a sophisticated and powerful strategy for directing substitution. Let's trace a logical pathway using the steps from this option, as the provided order has flaws (e.g., step vi nitrating a diazonium salt is illogical).\n    *   **A plausible, re-ordered synthesis using the reagents from Option C:**\n        1.  `(i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n        2.  `(ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation blocks the para position due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        3.  `(iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration occurs ortho to the t-butyl group, as this position is activated by the t-butyl group and meta to the deactivating sulfonic acid group. This gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        4.  `(iv) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        5.  `(v) NaNO2/HCl`: The amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n        6.  `(vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        7.  `(vi) HNO3/H2SO4`: Now, we nitrate this intermediate. The existing groups (-OH, -tBu, -SO3H) all cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. This gives **2-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**, establishing the correct relative positions.\n        8.  `(ix) NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the hydroxyl group to an ethoxy group, giving **2-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        9.  `(viii) dilute H2SO4`: Desulfonation removes the blocking group to yield the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n    This rearranged sequence is chemically sound and would lead to a high-yield synthesis.

Let's analyze the substitution pattern and the nature of the substituents.\n- **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at C1: Strong activator, ortho/para-director.\n- **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at C2: Weak activator, ortho/para-director, very bulky.\n- **Nitro group (-NO2)** at C3: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-pattern.\n- The ethoxy and nitro groups are meta to each other.\n- The tert-butyl group is ortho to both the ethoxy and the nitro group.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern with this specific combination of groups is challenging to achieve via direct electrophilic aromatic substitution, often requiring a more complex strategy involving blocking groups or functional group conversions that alter directing effects.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate each reaction sequence step by step. We will assume standard reaction conditions and outcomes. The key is to check if the sequence can logically lead to the desired 1,2,3-isomer in high yield.\n\n**Option B and C Analysis (Elimination):**\n- **Option B)** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\nStep (iv) is the diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) group. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which does not have an amine group. Therefore, this sequence is chemically incorrect.\n\n- **Option C)** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\nStep (i) forms nitrobenzene. Step (ii) reduces it to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. The amine group (-NH2) is a strong base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex (-NH2-AlCl3). This complex deactivates the ring and acts as a meta-director. Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on deactivated rings. Furthermore, it would lead to meta-alkylation, not the ortho relationship required. This route is very low-yield and leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n**Option D Analysis (Elimination):**\n`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\nThis sequence contains the steps for a blocking group strategy to force ortho substitution (steps i, ii, iii), which is a valid strategy. However, step (vi) suggests the nitration of a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are generally not subjected to nitration; they are unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions. This step is highly unorthodox and makes the sequence chemically unsound as written.\n\n**Option A Analysis (Detailed Walkthrough):**\nThis sequence appears to be the most chemically plausible in terms of standard functional group transformations, despite potential issues with regiochemistry.\n- **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n- **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but due to its large steric bulk, substitution at the para position is heavily favored. This yields **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** as the major product. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, we must proceed with this isomer.\n- **iii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group gives **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n- **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director.\n    - Starting with p-tert-butylanilinium (-NH3+ at C1, -tBu at C4).\n    - The -NH3+ group directs nitration to its meta positions (C3, C5).\n    - The -tBu group directs to its ortho positions (C2, C6).\n    - The positions ortho to the activating t-butyl group (C2, C6) are also meta to the deactivating -NH3+ group. Thus, substitution is strongly directed to these positions. The product is **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n- **v) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the primary amine group forms the corresponding **diazonium salt**.\n- **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n- **vii) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into an ether. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), yielding **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion of the Analysis of Option A:**\nThe sequence of reactions in option A (steps i-vii) is a logical and standard synthesis pathway. However, it unambiguously leads to the 1,2,4-substituted isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), not the requested 1,2,3-substituted isomer (2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene). The final two steps (viii, ix) involve sulfonation followed by desulfonation, which would not change the isomer and are nonsensical as placed.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThere is a high probability that the question is flawed, either in the name of the target compound or in the options provided. None of the options correctly describe a high-yield synthesis of the specified 1,2,3-isomer using standard organic reactions.\nHowever, in a multiple-choice context, one must choose the \"best\" option. Options B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or extremely inefficient steps. Option A describes a coherent, multi-step synthesis where each step is a standard, valid transformation. The only flaw is in the final regiochemistry. It is the most plausible sequence among the flawed choices, likely representing the intended answer despite the error in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Backbone**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   C1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   C3: nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Relative Positions**:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it strongly favors substitution at the para position over the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe key challenge in this synthesis is establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern, particularly the *meta* relationship between the tert-butyl group and the nitro group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option. Most organic syntheses on benzene rings involve a series of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions. The order in which these substitutions are performed is critical to obtaining the desired isomer.\n\n*   **Options starting with tert-butylation (B, C, D):**\n    *   **Step (i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation):** When benzene is alkylated with a tert-butyl group, the -tBu group is an ortho, para-director. Because of its significant steric bulk, the major product is overwhelmingly the para-substituted product, p-tert-butylbenzene. Any subsequent reactions will start from this 1,4-disubstituted intermediate (or its precursor).\n    *   **Problem:** Building a 1,2,3-trisubstituted product from a 1,4-disubstituted starting material is generally impossible without complex rearrangements or esoteric reactions not listed in the options. For example, in Option D, starting with p-tert-butylbenzene leads to p-tert-butylaniline, which upon nitration gives 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline. This leads to a final product with a 1,2,4 substitution pattern (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), not the desired 1,2,3 pattern. A similar regiochemical problem arises in options B and C. Therefore, options B, C, and D are unlikely to produce the target molecule in high yield.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    This option starts with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline.\n    *   **i) HNO3/H2SO4**: Benzene → **Nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **ii) Fe/HCl**: Nitrobenzene → **Aniline**.\n    *   **iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: This is the crucial step. Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is not straightforward. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form an anilinium complex [-NH2-AlCl3]+. This complex is strongly deactivating and, importantly, a **meta-director**. Therefore, the tert-butyl group will be directed to the meta position.\n        *   Product: **m-tert-butylaniline**. This step successfully establishes the required *meta* relationship between the future nitro group's position (C3 relative to the amine) and the tert-butyl group. However, let's reconsider the final product numbering. The final product is `2-tBu`, `1-OEt`, `3-NO2`. The aniline precursor for this must be `2-tBu-3-nitro-aniline` which is diazotized and converted to the phenol. To make this, one must start with `2-tBu-aniline`. A less common, but possible, outcome of alkylating aniline under certain conditions is ortho-alkylation. Let's assume the reaction conditions are set to produce **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   Let's follow the path from **o-tert-butylaniline** (2-tert-butylaniline), which is the necessary intermediate to achieve the final 1,2,3 pattern.\n        *   Intermediate: 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration. To avoid oxidation of the amino group and control regioselectivity, this is typically done by first protecting the amine as an acetanilide (`2-tert-butylacetanilide`). The powerful `NHAc` group directs para (to C4), while the `tBu` group directs to C3 and C5. While the para position (C4) is electronically favored by the `NHAc` group, the target requires nitration at C3. This is sterically hindered but electronically directed by the `tBu` group. A mixture of isomers is expected, but the desired **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** (after hydrolysis of the amide) is a possible product.\n    *   The remaining steps in Option A are unusually ordered. `v) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), `vi) SO3/H2SO4` (sulfonation), `vii) dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation), `viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat` (hydrolysis), `ix) NaOH/EtBr` (ether synthesis). The sulfonation/desulfonation steps (vi, vii) placed after diazotization seem illogical. A more standard application would be to use them after nitration (step iv) to separate the desired `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline` isomer from other isomers (a classic purification technique). Assuming this is the intended purpose, let's correct the order mentally.\n    *   **Corrected conceptual flow for A:**\n        1.  (i, ii, iii) Form **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n        2.  (iv) Nitrate (via acetanilide) to get a mixture containing **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n        3.  (vi, vii - reordered) Use sulfonation/desulfonation to isolate the desired isomer.\n        4.  (v) Take the pure **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** and diazotize it with `NaNO2/HCl`.\n        5.  (viii) Treat the diazonium salt with `H3O+, H2O/Heat` to hydrolyze it to the phenol: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n        6.  (ix) Use Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`) to convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the unconventional alkylation of aniline and the seemingly misplaced steps, Option A is the only sequence that provides a plausible route to establishing the crucial meta-relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups. The other options (B, C, D) start with a para-directing Friedel-Crafts reaction that leads to the wrong overall substitution pattern. Therefore, Option A represents the most viable, albeit complex and non-ideal, synthetic pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a logical analysis of each proposed pathway is necessary, paying close attention to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\nThe target molecule has the following substitution pattern:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at position 2 (ortho to the ethoxy group).\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at position 3 (meta to the ethoxy group and ortho to the tert-butyl group).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n**Option A Analysis**\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields tert-butylbenzene. This is a standard and effective first step.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, the major product is p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene, while the desired o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is the minor product. This step results in a low yield of the required intermediate.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group in o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene to an amino group, forming o-tert-butylaniline. This is a standard reduction.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to an anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivating meta-director. The tert-butyl group is a weak activating ortho, para-director. The directing effects are conflicting. However, literature confirms that nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline can produce the 3-nitro isomer.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This is a standard method to introduce a hydroxyl group.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n8.  **viii) SO3/H2SO4 & ix) dilute H2SO4**: These sulfonation and desulfonation steps are nonsensically placed at the end of the synthesis.\n\nDespite the low yield in step (ii) and potential regioselectivity issues in step (iv), the sequence of chemical transformations (i-vii) is logical. The final two steps (viii, ix) are likely an error in the question's formulation.\n\n**Other Options Analysis**\n*   **Option B**: This sequence fails at step (iii). Aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form a salt, which deactivates the ring and prevents the Friedel-Crafts alkylation from occurring.\n*   **Option C**: This sequence is illogical because it calls for diazotization (step iv) on a molecule that does not contain an amino group.\n*   **Option D**: This sequence is incorrect at step (vi). Treating a diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4) is not a standard synthetic transformation for aromatic substitution and would likely lead to decomposition.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy process of elimination, Option A is the only sequence where the proposed transformations are chemically plausible, even if some steps present yield challenges. The other options contain fundamentally flawed steps that would not work as described. Therefore, Option A represents the most viable, albeit imperfect, pathway among the choices provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nAn optimal synthesis must consider the directing effects of substituents to ensure the correct regiochemistry at each step, aiming for a high yield. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nLet's analyze the substitution pattern and directing effects:\n*   **Substituents:** -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) at C1, -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl) at C2, and -NO2 (nitro) at C3.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   Ethoxy (-OEt) is a strongly activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   tert-butyl (-tBu) is a moderately activating ortho, para-director.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2) is a strongly deactivating meta-director.\n\nA key feature of the target molecule is that the activating groups (-OEt, -tBu) are ortho to each other, while one activating group (-OEt) is meta to the deactivating group (-NO2). This suggests that the nitro group was likely introduced when a meta-directing group was present on the ring. The most effective way to control the position of multiple substituents is often through the use of blocking groups, such as a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be added and later removed.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed synthetic pathways based on these principles.\n\n### Analysis of the Correct Synthetic Route:\n\nA logical high-yield synthesis for this 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene would proceed as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is alkylated with tert-butyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3. This attaches the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + (CH3)3CCl / AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director.\n\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** To control the position of the next substituent, we use a sulfonic acid group as a reversible blocking group. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, sulfonation occurs predominantly at the para position.\n    *   tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   This blocks the para position, forcing the next electrophile to add to an ortho position.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** Now, nitration is performed. We have an ortho, para-directing tert-butyl group at C4 and a meta-directing sulfonic acid group at C1. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 position. Their directing effects are cooperative, leading to a high yield of a single isomer.\n    *   4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n4.  **Reduction of the Nitro Group:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, which is a necessary precursor for introducing the hydroxyl group via diazotization.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n5.  **Diazotization:** The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    *   2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid salt.\n\n6.  **Hydrolysis to a Phenol:** The diazonium salt is gently heated in water to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group.\n    *   Diazonium salt + H2O/Heat → 4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n7.  **Desulfonation (Removal of Blocking Group):** The sulfonic acid blocking group is removed by heating in dilute acid. This is a critical step that reveals the desired meta relationship between the -OH group and the position where the t-butyl group is.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/Heat → 3-tert-butylphenol.\n\n8.  **Nitration:** The phenol is nitrated. The hydroxyl group is a powerful ortho, para-director, and the tert-butyl group is also an ortho, para-director. The -OH at C1 directs to C2, C4, C6. The t-butyl at C3 directs to C2, C4, C6. Their effects are strongly cooperative, directing the nitro group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 (ortho to -OH and ortho to -tBu) is sterically hindered and highly activated. Position 4 (para to -OH) is also strongly activated. Position 6 (ortho to -OH) is another possibility. The most probable major product will be 6-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol due to the powerful directing effect of the hydroxyl group. This leads us to the desired precursor. Let's assume the numbering starts from OH.\n    *   3-tert-butylphenol + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol. (The numbering is now C1=-OH, C3=-tBu, C6=-NO2. This is equivalent to C1=-OH, C2=-NO2, C5=-tBu, which is not our target precursor).\n\nThere seems to be a mistake in the above logical path, let's re-examine Option A, as it contains many of the key transformations.\n\n### Re-evaluation of Option A:\n\n**A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr**\n\nLet's assume there are typos in this provided sequence and try to rearrange it into the correct order based on the steps given. The correct synthesis likely involves these reagents but in a different sequence. Comparing the required steps to build the molecule with the reagents provided in the options, none of the sequences are perfectly logical or synthetically sound as written. There are misplaced steps (like Fe/HCl before nitration), redundant steps, or steps that would lead to incorrect isomers.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" option by assuming significant typographical errors in the order of reactions, one must find a path that is the most plausible. No option provides a direct, high-yield path to the target molecule as written. The complexity of the synthesis and the flaws in each option suggest the question itself may be flawed.\n\nGiven the significant issues with all provided options, it is not possible to definitively select a correct sequence of reactions that would lead to a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. All options contain fatal chemical errors in the proposed order of reactions.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis, none of the options are correct. However, if this is a multiple-choice question from a source, there might be an intended answer despite the flaws. Without a valid pathway among the choices, a definitive answer cannot be provided.\n\nLet's analyze again to see if a different interpretation can make one option work. The target is 2-tBu, 1-OEt, 3-NO2.\nIf we re-examine D:\ni) tBu -> tert-butylbenzene\nii) NO2 -> o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (let's assume ortho isomer is taken, low yield) -> 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene\niii) Fe/HCl -> 2-tert-butylaniline\n*At this point we have the 1,2 arrangement of the amino and t-butyl groups.*\niv) **HNO3/H2SO4** -> Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. Protonation of -NH2 gives -NH3+, a meta-director. -tBu is an o,p director. Directing effects are opposed. This step would give a mixture of products, likely 2-tert-butyl-4-nitroaniline and 2-tert-butyl-6-nitroaniline, not the required 3-nitro isomer.\n\nLet's check C again:\ni) HNO3 -> Nitrobenzene\nii) Fe/HCl -> Aniline\niii) tBuCl/AlCl3 -> This would produce meta-tert-butylaniline, as AlCl3 complexes with the amine, making it a meta-director. The target has the amine-derived group and the t-butyl group ortho. So this is incorrect.\n\nAll options contain incorrect steps that would either fail, give very low yields, or produce the wrong isomer. There is no correct answer among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nThe goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene with high yield. Let's analyze the substitution pattern of the target molecule and evaluate the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\n\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n*   **Positions:** These three groups are adjacent on the benzene ring in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   Ethoxy (-OEt): Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   tert-Butyl (-tBu): Activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Nitro (-NO2): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nA successful high-yield synthesis must carefully control the order of substitution to take advantage of these directing effects. Let's evaluate the correct synthetic strategy, which should match one of the options.\n\n**Plausible Synthetic Pathway Determination:**\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Begin by adding the tert-butyl group to benzene using tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3. This forms tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director.\n    *   *Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene*\n\n2.  **Nitration:** Nitrate tert-butylbenzene using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product will be the para-substituted isomer, 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene. The ortho isomer is a minor product. For a high-yield synthesis, we proceed with the major isomer.\n    *   *tert-Butylbenzene → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene*\n\n3.  **Reduction of Nitro Group:** Reduce the nitro group to an amino group using a reducing agent like iron (Fe) in hydrochloric acid (HCl). This forms 4-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   *1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene → 4-tert-butylaniline*\n\n4.  **Second Nitration (Key Step):** This is the crucial step to establish the 1,2,3 substitution pattern. We nitrate 4-tert-butylaniline. In the strongly acidic nitrating medium (HNO3/H2SO4), the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group remains an ortho/para-director. On the 4-tert-butylaniline substrate, the meta-directing -NH3+ group (at C4) and the ortho-directing -tBu group (at C1) both direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 position. This results in the formation of 4-amino-3-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (IUPAC: 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline). This step allows for the specific placement of the nitro group adjacent to the tert-butyl group.\n    *   *4-tert-butylaniline → 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline*\n\n5.  **Diazotization:** Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt using sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) at low temperature.\n    *   *4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline → 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride*\n\n6.  **Hydrolysis to Phenol:** The diazonium salt is then hydrolyzed to a phenol by heating in an aqueous acidic solution (H3O+, H2O/Heat). This replaces the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   *Diazonium salt → 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol*\n\n7.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** Finally, the hydroxyl group of the phenol is converted to an ethoxy group. This is achieved by deprotonating the phenol with a base (like NaOH) to form a phenoxide, followed by reaction with an ethyl halide (like EtBr). This yields the final product, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   *4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene*\n\n**Comparison with Options:**\n\nNow, let's compare this viable sequence with the given options.\n\n*   **Option A:** Uses sulfonation as a directing group, which leads to a different isomer, and has an illogical nitration step on a diazonium salt.\n*   **Option B:** Fails at step (iii) because Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on anilines due to the Lewis acid complexing with the amino group.\n*   **Option C:** Has an incorrect order of reactions, attempting to use a diazotizing agent on a molecule without an amino group.\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Correct)\n    *   ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Correct)\n    *   iii) Fe/HCl (Correct)\n    *   iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (Correct - the key step)\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl (Correct)\n    *   vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (Correct)\n    *   vii) NaOH/EtBr (Correct - forms the final product)\n\nThe first seven steps of option D perfectly match the chemically sound pathway derived above. The final two steps, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, are superfluous as the target molecule has already been synthesized. They are likely included as distractors. Among the choices provided, option D is the only one that presents a correct sequence to achieve the desired product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct sequence of reactions:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down its structure:\n    *   A benzene ring.\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n    The substituents are adjacent to each other on the ring (1, 2, 3 substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Substituents and Their Directing Effects:**\n    In Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS), the existing groups on the ring direct where the new group will go.\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, ortho, para-director. It's very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the ortho positions.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Retrosynthesis Strategy (Working Backwards):**\n    *   **Step a: Introducing the ethoxy group.** An ethoxy group is typically added via the Williamson ether synthesis. This requires a phenol (-OH group) as a precursor. The reaction is `Ar-OH + base (e.g., NaOH) -> Ar-O-`, followed by `Ar-O- + ethyl halide (e.g., EtBr) -> Ar-OEt`.\n        *   So, the immediate precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Note: When -OH is present, it gets numbering priority as the parent 'phenol', so C1 has the OH. The other groups are at C2 and C3, hence the name 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol).\n    *   **Step b: Creating the phenol group.** A phenol group is commonly made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. The sequence is `Ar-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Ar-N2+ --(H2O, heat)--> Ar-OH`.\n        *   The precursor to our phenol must be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **Step c: Synthesizing 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.** This molecule has three groups. We need to determine the order of their introduction. Let's consider the last addition.\n        *   **Option c1: Nitration.** If we nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a very strong o,p-director. However, in strong acidic conditions (like HNO3/H2SO4 for nitration), it gets protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a **meta-director**. The t-butyl group at C2 is an o,p-director.\n            *   On 2-tert-butylanilinium, the -NH3+ (at C1) directs to positions 3 and 5.\n            *   The -tBu (at C2) directs to positions 3, 5, and 1 (blocked).\n            *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to positions 3 and 5. The desired product requires nitration at position 3. This is a plausible step.\n        *   **Option c2: Alkylation.** Introducing a t-butyl group onto 3-nitroaniline. Friedel-Crafts alkylation doesn't work well on rings with deactivating groups like -NO2 or with basic groups like -NH2 (which reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst). This path is not viable.\n        *   **Option c3: Reduction.** Starting with 1-tert-butyl-2,3-dinitrobenzene and selectively reducing one nitro group. Creating 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivatives like this can be very difficult. Nitrating 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene would direct the second nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not 3.\n    *   **Conclusion from Step c:** The most likely path to 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   **Step d: Synthesizing 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is easily made by reducing the corresponding nitro compound, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. A common reagent for this is Fe/HCl or Sn/HCl.\n    *   **Step e: Synthesizing 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.** This comes from the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Nitration will produce a mixture of ortho (the desired product) and para isomers. The para isomer is usually the major product due to less steric hindrance. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, this step is not ideal, but it's a standard reaction. A blocking group strategy could be used to improve the yield of the ortho product, but let's stick to the simplest path first.\n    *   **Step f: Synthesizing tert-butylbenzene.** This is done by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Forward Synthesis and Compare with Options:**\n    Based on our retrosynthesis, the forward reaction sequence is:\n    1.  **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**  -> tert-butylbenzene\n    2.  **tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4** -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (+ para isomer)\n    3.  **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl** -> 2-tert-butylaniline\n    4.  **2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4** -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline\n    5.  **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl** -> Diazonium salt\n    6.  **Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat** -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n    7.  **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr** -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (Final Product)\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A)** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts. Friedel-Crafts on aniline is problematic as the catalyst reacts with the amine. Also, step (vi) `SO3/H2SO4` on a diazonium salt is chemically incorrect. **Option A is wrong.**\n    *   **B)** After making nitro-tert-butylbenzene, it tries to sulfonate it. The subsequent steps are illogical. **Option B is wrong.**\n    *   **C)** Let's match its steps with our derived sequence:\n        *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` - Matches step 1.\n        *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` - Matches step 2.\n        *   iii) `Fe/HCl` - Matches step 3.\n        *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` - Matches step 4.\n        *   v) `NaNO2/HCl` - Matches step 5.\n        *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` - Matches step 6.\n        *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr` - Matches step 7.\n        This sequence perfectly matches our logical synthesis. The option includes two additional, unnecessary steps (viii, ix) at the end, which are likely typos in the question. However, the core synthesis (i-vii) is the most plausible route among all choices.\n    *   **D)** It attempts a blocking group strategy (`SO3/H2SO4` at step ii) but then follows with an incorrect sequence of reactions (e.g., reducing the nitro group before removing the blocking group, and attempting to nitrate a diazonium salt). **Option D is wrong.**\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option C outlines the most chemically sound pathway to synthesize the target molecule, despite potential regioselectivity issues and two superfluous steps listed at the end. The other options contain fundamental chemical errors. Therefore, C is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern and the nature of the substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at C1: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at C2: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at C3: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* (1,2).\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* (2,3).\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* (1,3).\n\n**2. Evaluate the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nAchieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is often difficult using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the substituents can conflict. The most challenging aspect here is the *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl group (an o,p-director) and the nitro group (a m-director). A direct electrophilic attack to create this arrangement on a ring that already contains one of these groups is unlikely. For instance, nitrating tert-butylbenzene would primarily give the para product, with the ortho product as a minor isomer (not a high-yield route). Alkylating nitrobenzene with tert-butyl chloride (Friedel-Crafts) does not work because the nitro group strongly deactivates the ring.\n\nThis difficulty suggests that a more sophisticated strategy is required, likely involving a **blocking group** to control the regiochemistry. A sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is an excellent choice for a blocking group because it's bulky, a meta-director, and can be easily removed later by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Develop a Logical Synthetic Strategy (using a blocking group)**\n\nA powerful strategy to control substitution is to:\n1.  Install the alkyl group.\n2.  Use a blocking group to occupy the most reactive position (usually para).\n3.  Install the next substituent, which will now be directed to the remaining activated positions (ortho).\n\nLet's apply this:\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start by adding the tert-butyl group to benzene.\n    Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n*   **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** Add the blocking group. Due to the steric bulk of the t-Bu group, sulfonation will occur almost exclusively at the para position.\n    tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   **Step 3: Nitration.** Now, nitrate the ring. We have two directing groups:\n    *   -tBu at C1 is an o,p-director (directs to C2, C6).\n    *   -SO3H at C4 is a m-director (directs to C2, C6).\n    Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to the same positions (C2 and C6). This is a highly regioselective reaction.\n    4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n\nThis initial sequence (Alkylation → Sulfonation → Nitration) is a very logical and high-yield approach to creating a specific trisubstituted benzene intermediate.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's examine which of the given options follows this logical start.\n*   **A)** i) tBu-Cl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4... The order is incorrect.\n*   **B)** i) tBu-Cl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4... The order is incorrect. It also leads to the wrong isomer and has superfluous steps.\n*   **C)** i) HNO3/H2SO4... Starts with nitration, and the subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (after reduction) is problematic. The order is incorrect.\n*   **D)** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4... This option perfectly matches the first three steps of our logical, regiocontrolled strategy.\n\n**5. Assess the Complete Sequence in Option D**\n\nWhile the first three steps of Option D are the most chemically sound approach among all choices, the entire sequence as written presents inconsistencies. The intermediate produced, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, has the t-Bu and -NO2 groups *meta* to each other. The final product requires them to be *ortho*. The subsequent steps as listed in option D do not provide a standard mechanism to alter this relative positioning.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question where options A, B, and C contain clear and fundamental errors (failed reactions, incorrect starting order for selectivity), Option D presents the most plausible *strategic thinking*, even if the problem statement (target molecule or subsequent steps) might be flawed. The use of a blocking group as shown in the initial steps of D is the key textbook method for tackling such a complex substitution pattern. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\nThe subsequent (hypothetically correct) steps would involve manipulation of the nitro and sulfonic acid groups (e.g., reduction, diazotization, substitution, desulfonation) to arrive at the final product, but the exact order is scrambled or incorrect in the provided option. Nevertheless, the foundation of the synthesis in D is superior to all other options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to identify the correct synthetic route.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Benzene.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Positions:** The substituents are on adjacent carbons, a 1,2,3-pattern.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Synthetic Strategies in the Options\nThe final ethoxy group (-OEt) is a strong ortho,para-director. It's often installed late in a synthesis via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/R-X`) from a phenol (-OH). A phenol, in turn, can be created from a primary amine (-NH2) using a Sandmeyer-like reaction (diazotization with `NaNO2/HCl` followed by hydrolysis with `H3O+`). This amine -> diazonium -> phenol -> ether sequence is a powerful tool for controlling substitution patterns and is a key feature to look for.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option by predicting the major products.\n\n#### **Option A: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n1.  **Step i):** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives `tert-butylbenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** Nitration of `tert-butylbenzene`. The t-Bu group is an ortho,para-director, but its extreme bulk heavily favors para-substitution. The major product is `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`.\n3.  **Step iv):** Diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. The molecule produced in the preceding steps does not have an amino group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence contains a chemically impossible step and is incorrect.\n\n#### **Option C: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n1.  **Step i):** Benzene → `tert-butylbenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** Sulfonation of `tert-butylbenzene`. Due to the steric hindrance of both the t-Bu and -SO3H groups, the substitution occurs at the para position, yielding `p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n3.  **Step iii):** Nitration. Now the t-Bu group directs ortho (since para is blocked) and the -SO3H group directs meta. Both direct to the position at C2. The product is `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence leads to a **1,2,4-substitution pattern**, which is the wrong isomer.\n\n#### **Option D: `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n1.  **Step i):** Benzene → `tert-butylbenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** Nitration of `tert-butylbenzene` gives `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` as the major product.\n3.  **Step iii):** Reduction of the nitro group with `Fe/HCl` gives `p-tert-butylaniline`.\n4.  **Step iv):** Nitration of `p-tert-butylaniline`. In the strongly acidic nitrating conditions, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. Both the -NH3+ at C1 and the -tBu at C4 direct the incoming nitro group to the position between them (C3). The product is `3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence leads to a **1,3,4-substitution pattern**, which is the wrong isomer.\n\n#### **Option B: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tBuCl/AlCl3 ...`**\nLet's analyze the core transformations in this sequence. Although some steps have low yields in practice and the step order is listed confusingly, it is the only remaining possibility.\n1.  **Step i):** `HNO3/H2SO4` on benzene → `Nitrobenzene`.\n2.  **Step ii):** `Fe/HCl` on `Nitrobenzene` → `Aniline`. This correctly creates the amine handle for further transformations.\n3.  **Step iii):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on `Aniline`. While Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline is problematic, let's assume the question intends for it to work. To get the final product, the t-Bu group must be installed ortho to the amine, giving `o-tert-butylaniline`. This is the only way presented in the options to create the necessary 1,2-arrangement of the nitrogen and t-butyl groups.\n4.  **Step iv):** `HNO3/H2SO4` on `o-tert-butylaniline`. In strong acid, we get the o-tert-butylanilinium ion. The -NH3+ (meta-director) and the -tBu (ortho,para-director) have competing effects. However, substitution at C3 is a possible outcome and is the only one that leads to the required 1,2,3-pattern, forming `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`.\n5.  **Step v):** `NaNO2/HCl` converts the amine into a diazonium salt.\n6.  **Step viii):** `H3O+, H2O/Heat` hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`.\n7.  **Step ix):** `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) converts the phenol into the ethoxy ether, yielding the final target product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Despite some steps being non-ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, this is the only option that presents a plausible chemical pathway to the correct isomer. The other options are definitively wrong as they lead to incorrect isomers or involve impossible reactions.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must evaluate the chemical feasibility and regioselectivity of each proposed route.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule and Strategy\n\nThe target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. This arrangement is sterically crowded, and its high-yield synthesis requires careful control over the directing effects of substituents. A simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work due to the formation of undesired isomers. The presence of reagents for sulfonation (`SO₃/H₂SO₄`) and subsequent desulfonation (`dilute H₂SO₄`) strongly suggests that a **blocking group strategy** is required. The sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is used to temporarily occupy a position (usually the para position) to force subsequent substituents into other desired locations, and is then removed later in the sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **Option A**: This sequence fails early on. Step (ii) would nitrate tert-butylbenzene primarily at the *para* position, not leading to the 1,2,3-pattern. Furthermore, step (iv) `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization) is performed without an amine functional group being present, which is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B**: This sequence starts by making aniline (`i` and `ii`). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic lone pair on the amine, deactivating the ring towards alkylation.\n\n*   **Option D**: This sequence also fails on regioselectivity. Step (ii) involves the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director that heavily favors substitution at the sterically unhindered *para* position. This leads to 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene as the major product, which cannot be converted into the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted final product.\n\n*   **Option C**: This sequence presents the only viable strategy using a blocking group.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: This correctly performs a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on benzene to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄**: This step introduces a sulfonic acid (-SO₃H) group at the *para* position of tert-butylbenzene, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This effectively **blocks** the para position from further substitution.\n    3.  **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: With the para position blocked, nitration is forced to occur at an *ortho* position relative to the t-butyl group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is the crucial step that establishes the 1,2 relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to a primary amine, forming **4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    5.  **Remaining steps (v-ix)**: The remaining reagents are used to install the final nitro and ethoxy groups and remove the blocking group. Although the order listed might seem slightly confusing, the reagents are correct for the necessary transformations: diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), conversion to a phenol (`H₃O⁺/Heat`), introduction of the final nitro group (`HNO₃/H₂SO₄`), removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group (`dilute H₂SO₄`), and finally, Williamson ether synthesis to form the ethoxy group (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n\nBy a process of elimination and by recognizing the necessary blocking group strategy, Option C is the only chemically sound choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nI have analyzed the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern on the benzene ring. I will evaluate each option to determine the most viable high-yield pathway.\n\n**Analysis of the Target Molecule and Substituent Effects:**\n*   **Target:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, *ortho, para*-director, very bulky.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Positional Relationships:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nA successful high-yield synthesis must carefully control the sequence of reactions to use the directing effects of the substituents to install the new groups in the desired positions.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene would primarily yield the *para* product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group.\n    iii) If we proceed with the major *para* product, sulfonation would occur at the position ortho to the tert-butyl group, leading to an incorrect substitution pattern.\n    iv) The sequence proceeds to a diazotization step (NaNO2/HCl), but there is no primary amine present to react. This makes the sequence chemically impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    This option includes steps for using a sulfonic acid blocking group (ii, viii), which is a valid strategy for directing substitution. However, the order of the reactions as listed is illogical. For example, it performs a reduction (iv), followed by diazotization (v), and then attempts another nitration (vi). This sequence is not chemically sound. While the list of reagents might be useful in a different order, the sequence as presented is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.\n    iii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the nitrogen atom of the amino group is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack. Therefore, this option is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step, assuming it aims for a high-yield process by taking the major product at each stage.\n    i) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene.** A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    ii) **tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives the *para* product as the major isomer due to the large steric hindrance of the tert-butyl group, which disfavors *ortho* substitution. This step is high-yield.\n    iii) **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butylaniline.** Reduction of the nitro group to a primary amine.\n    iv) **4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline.** The powerful activating, *ortho, para*-directing amino group (-NH2) directs the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to itself (position 2).\n    v) **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.** The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    vi) **Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n    vii) **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ethoxy ether.\n\nThe final product of this logical sequence is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is an *isomer* of the target molecule. The remaining steps, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, would not cause the necessary skeletal rearrangement to form the desired product. Given that options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible or illogical steps, option D describes the only chemically coherent multi-step synthesis, albeit for an isomer of the target compound. This suggests a likely error in the problem statement's target molecule name. Assuming the question intended to ask for the synthesis of the isomer produced by this logical pathway, this is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe problem asks to identify the sequence of reactions that would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and work backward (retrosynthesis) and then evaluate the given options.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nThe substituents are:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relationships are: -OEt is *ortho* to -tBu and *meta* to -NO2. The -tBu is *ortho* to both -OEt and -NO2.\n\n**Analysis of the final steps:**\nThe final product is an ether. A very common method for synthesizing aryl ethers is the Williamson ether synthesis, which involves reacting a phenoxide with an alkyl halide. The reagent `NaOH/EtBr` (step vii in option B) is characteristic of this reaction. This implies the immediate precursor is a phenol: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\nHow is this phenol synthesized? A common route to phenols is through the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, which is in turn made from an aniline. The reagents `NaNO2/HCl` followed by `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (steps v and vi in option B) correspond to this transformation. This suggests the precursor to the phenol is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\nNow, the central chemical puzzle is how to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline with the correct regiochemistry. The -NH2 and -NO2 groups are *meta* to each other, while the -tBu group is *ortho* to both. This specific arrangement can be achieved by following a specific sequence of reactions that control the directing effects of the substituents.\n\nLet's evaluate the sequence proposed in Option B, which aligns with our retrosynthetic analysis.\n\n**Evaluation of Option B:**\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation which installs the tert-butyl group, forming *tert-butylbenzene*. This is a logical first step.\n\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** This is electrophilic aromatic nitration. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. However, due to its large steric bulk, nitration heavily favors the *para* position (forming 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) over the *ortho* position (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene). While the yield of the *ortho* isomer is lower, it is the necessary intermediate for the desired final product. We must proceed with this *ortho* product.\n\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** This is a standard and high-yield reduction of a nitro group to an amino group, producing *2-tert-butylaniline*.\n\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 2-tert-butylaniline:** This is the key step for establishing the correct regiochemistry. Under the strongly acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. Although the tert-butyl group is an activating *ortho, para*-director, nitration can be directed to the position *meta* to the -NH3+ group, which is position 3. This reaction is known to produce the desired *2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline*.\n\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the diazotization of the primary amino group to form a diazonium salt. This is a standard procedure.\n\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol upon heating in acidic water, yielding *2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol*.\n\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** The phenol is first deprotonated by NaOH to form the more nucleophilic phenoxide ion, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis seven-step sequence is a chemically logical and valid pathway to the target molecule. The remaining steps, (viii) and (ix) in option B, are extraneous as the final product has already been formed. The other options contain chemically flawed sequences. For instance, option C attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a nitrobenzene ring, which is highly deactivated and does not work. Option A has a nonsensical step of adding nitrating mixture to a diazonium salt.\n\nTherefore, despite the issue of yield in step (ii) and the extraneous final steps, the sequence of reactions i-vii in option B represents the most plausible and correct synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern and directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at C1: Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at C2: Activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at C3: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern. This is a sterically crowded arrangement that is often challenging to synthesize directly via electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), as directing groups typically favor substitution at less hindered positions. Achieving this pattern often requires a multi-step strategy involving blocking groups or the conversion of one functional group into another after directing other substitutions.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options by Forward Synthesis**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step should proceed with good regioselectivity for the desired intermediate.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation).\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-Bu group is o,p-directing but bulky. The major product is `para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` (~70-80%), with the `ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` being a minor product. To proceed towards a 1,2,3-substituted product, we would need the ortho isomer. This low yield in an early step makes this pathway inefficient and not \"high-yield\".\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline is problematic as the Lewis acid (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. To perform this reaction, the amino group must be protected, typically as an acetanilide (-NHCOCH3). The acetamido group is a strong o,p-director. FC-alkylation of acetanilide gives predominantly the `para-tert-butylacetanilide` due to sterics. After deprotection, this yields `p-tert-butylaniline`. The t-butyl and amino groups are para, while the target requires them to be ortho (in relative positions 1 and 2). This path leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n**Option D:** This option starts with a blocking group strategy, which is often employed for controlling regiochemistry in EAS. Let's analyze it carefully.\n\n*   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene → `tert-butylbenzene`**. This is a standard, high-yield reaction.\n*   **ii) `SO3/H2SO4` on `tert-butylbenzene` → `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**. The bulky t-Bu group directs the incoming sulfonic acid group to the sterically accessible para position. This is a high-yield step.\n*   **iii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` → `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`**. Now we have two directing groups:\n    *   The t-Bu group (at C1) is an o,p-director. The para position is blocked by -SO3H, so it directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   The -SO3H group (at C4) is a meta-director. It directs to C2 and C6.\n    Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C2/C6). This leads to a high yield of the desired product, `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this molecule, the t-Bu and NO2 groups are *ortho* to each other, which is the required relative positioning for the final product.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence D provide a high-yield route to an intermediate with the correct ortho-relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups, which is a significant challenge overcome. The other options fail at this early stage to provide a high-yield path to the required substitution pattern. Although the remaining steps in option D appear scrambled (e.g., nitrating a diazonium salt), the initial sequence is the most chemically sound and strategic among all choices. In multiple-choice questions of this nature, the option with the most logical and effective initial strategy is typically the intended answer, even if there are typos in later steps. The path laid out in steps (i)-(iii) of option D is the standard and most effective way to achieve ortho-nitration of tert-butylbenzene.\n\nLet's hypothetically unscramble the rest of D to show a plausible route:\n1.  i) `t-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> t-butylbenzene\n2.  ii) `SO3/H2SO4` -> 4-t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n3.  iii) `HNO3/H2SO4` -> 4-t-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid\n4.  viii) `dilute H2SO4` (Desulfonation) -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene\n5.  iv) `Fe/HCl` (Reduction) -> 2-tert-butylaniline\n6.  `HNO3` (under special conditions, e.g., nitration of the anilinium salt) -> 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline\n7.  v) `NaNO2/HCl` (Diazotization)\n8.  vii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (Hydrolysis to phenol) -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n9.  ix) `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n\nThis long but plausible synthesis uses the reagents provided in option D. The crucial part is that the start of sequence D is the only one that correctly uses a blocking group to establish the difficult ortho-substitution pattern in high yield.\n\nTherefore, sequence D represents the most viable strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nA comprehensive analysis of the reaction options is required to determine the correct high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern (ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro), which is often challenging to achieve and typically requires a specific order of reactions, sometimes involving blocking groups.\n\nLet's analyze the steps for the most plausible synthetic route:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: The synthesis must begin by introducing the tert-butyl group onto the benzene ring. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl₃. This reaction is generally effective.\n    *   *Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-butylbenzene*\n\n2.  **Nitration**: The next step is nitration. Nitrating tert-butylbenzene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) will yield a mixture of ortho and para products. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product will be *4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene*, with *2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene* as the minor product. A high-yield synthesis must effectively utilize the major isomer.\n\n3.  **Reduction of the Nitro Group**: The nitro group of *4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene* is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂), typically using a reducing agent like iron in hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This yields *4-tert-butylaniline*.\n\n4.  **Second Nitration**: The next crucial step is another nitration. In 4-tert-butylaniline, the amino group is a powerful ortho, para-directing and activating group. It will direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to it (position 2), as the para position is blocked by the tert-butyl group. This reaction yields *4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline*.\n\n5.  **Diazotization**: The amino group of *4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline* is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻) using sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid (NaNO₂/HCl) at low temperatures.\n\n6.  **Hydrolysis to a Phenol**: The diazonium salt is then converted into a phenol by heating with water (H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat). The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming *4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol*.\n\n7.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis**: Finally, the ethoxy group is introduced. The phenol is treated with a base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form a phenoxide ion, which then reacts with an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis. This converts the hydroxyl group to an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), yielding the final product.\n\nHowever, this detailed pathway leads to the synthesis of **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, not the desired *2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene*. None of the provided options correctly map out a high-yield synthesis for the specified target molecule. The substitution pattern of the intended product requires a more complex synthetic strategy, likely involving blocking groups in a different sequence or using less common reactions that are not reflected in the standard options. For example, creating the ortho-tert-butyl-nitro arrangement is non-trivial. It appears there is a fundamental flaw in the question's options relative to the stated target product.\n\nGiven the significant discrepancy between the target molecule and the products of the reaction sequences, it is not possible to select a correct option from the list provided.\n\n<<<The provided options do not lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Target Molecule Analysis:**\nThe target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. This is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   The two ortho/para-directing groups (-OEt, -tBu) are ortho to each other.\n*   The strongly activating -OEt group is meta to the -NO2 group.\n*   The -tBu group is ortho to the -NO2 group.\n\nThe fact that the powerful activating group (-OEt) is meta to a group introduced by electrophilic aromatic substitution (-NO2) is a major clue. This typically happens if the nitration occurs when the precursor to the -OEt group is a meta-director. The standard way to achieve this is by nitrating an anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -NH3+ group can then be converted to an -OEt group.\n\n**2. Evaluation of Reaction Sequences:**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this strategy and general principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by making aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivating group (-NH3+) that poisons the catalyst and prevents the alkylation. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) is the formation of a diazonium salt from an amine. Step (vi) is the nitration of this intermediate. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used immediately. Attempting to perform a nitration reaction on a diazonium salt under strong acid and heat is not a viable synthetic step. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** This is a permutation of the reagents from other options, but the sequence is also flawed and does not lead to the desired product through a logical synthetic pathway. For example, step (iii) involves sulfonating o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene which would give a mixture, and step (iv) attempts to use NaNO2/HCl on the resulting sulfonic acid, which is not a standard reaction.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    Let's analyze this sequence carefully:\n    1.  `i) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3` -> `tert-butylbenzene`. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  `ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene`. This gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The bulky t-Bu group favors the formation of the para isomer (`p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`) in high yield, with the ortho isomer (`o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`) as a minor product. To match the final product's ortho relationship between the t-Bu and a NO2 group, we would have to proceed with the minor ortho isomer, which is a flaw for a \"high-yield\" synthesis but is chemically possible. Let's assume we isolate `o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`.\n    3.  `iii) Reduction of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene with Fe/HCl` -> `o-tert-butylaniline`. Standard reduction.\n    4.  `iv) Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline`. Under the strong acidic conditions of HNO3/H2SO4, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Let's analyze the directing effects on `o-tert-butylanilinium` (NH3+ at C2, tBu at C1): The -NH3+ group at C2 directs meta to C4 and C6. The -tBu group at C1 directs ortho,para to C2(blocked), C4, and C6. Both groups direct incoming electrophiles to positions 4 and 6. This would not yield the required 3-nitro isomer needed for the final product structure. *However, this is a known complex reaction, and all other options are chemically impossible*. Given that this is a multiple-choice question, and options B, C, and D are definitively wrong due to fundamental errors, A remains the only possibility, implying this path works as intended, even if it appears low-yield or complex.\n    5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr`: This is the correct and standard three-step sequence to convert the aniline intermediate into an ethoxy group.\n    6.  `viii) and ix)`: These final steps, sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are redundant on the final product and likely represent a flaw in the question's option list, but they don't invalidate the core synthetic pathway from i to vii.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy eliminating options B, C, and D which contain impossible synthetic steps, Option A remains the only plausible, albeit imperfect, choice. It outlines a sequence of known reactions that could, in principle, form the target molecule.\n\n```python\ndef solve_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided reaction sequences to identify the one that synthesizes\n    2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analysis of the Reaction Sequences:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    print(\"Target Molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\")\n    print(\"This requires a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring (OEt at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Option D Analysis:\")\n    print(\"Starts with nitration then reduction to aniline.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n*   -OEt is a strong activator and an ortho, para-director.\n*   -tBu is a weak activator and an ortho, para-director. It is very bulky.\n*   -NO2 is a strong deactivator and a meta-director.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires a careful strategy, sometimes involving blocking groups or exploiting changes in directing effects of functional groups during the synthesis.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options based on Initial Steps**\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration of benzene (i), followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (iii). Friedel-Crafts reactions on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) do not work. Even on aniline, it is problematic as the amine reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst. So, Option D is incorrect.\n*   **Options A, B, C:** All start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride (i), forming tert-butylbenzene. This is a logical first step. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director.\n\n**3. Analyze the Core Synthetic Strategy**\n\nAchieving the 1,2,3-substitution pattern directly from tert-butylbenzene is difficult. Direct substitution on tert-butylbenzene would occur at the para (C4) and ortho (C2, C6) positions. To get a group at C3, a more complex strategy is needed. A common high-yield strategy for controlling regiochemistry is the use of a blocking group, typically a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be easily added and later removed.\n\nLet's look for a sequence that employs this strategy logically.\n\n*   **Option A and C:** They introduce the nitro group (ii) right after the tert-butyl group. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mostly the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) due to the steric bulk of the t-Bu group. To obtain an ortho relationship as needed for the final product, we would have to rely on the minor ortho-nitration product, which contradicts the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n*   **Option B:** This option starts with alkylation (i) followed by sulfonation (ii). This is the hallmark of a blocking group strategy. Let's analyze this path in detail.\n\n**4. Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis of Option B (and its implied logic)**\n\nThe listed order of reagents in the options can sometimes be confusing or contain typos. The key is to see if the *set* of reagents can form a logical and high-yield pathway to the product. Option B contains a very clever, known synthesis route.\n\n**The logical (rearranged) synthesis using the reagents from Option B:**\n\n1.  **Step (i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   This is the start of the sequence.\n\n2.  **Step (ii) Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   The bulky t-Bu group directs the sulfonation to the para position, making this a high-yield step.\n\n3.  **Step (iii) Nitration:** 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   This is a critical step. Let's analyze the directing effects on 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   The -tBu group at C4 is an activator and o,p-director, directing to C3 and C5 (its ortho positions).\n        *   The -SO3H group at C1 is a deactivator and m-director, also directing to C3 and C5 (its meta positions).\n    *   Since both groups direct to the same positions (C3 and C5), this nitration is highly regioselective and high-yield.\n\n4.  **Step (iv) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine. 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → **3-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   The nitro group is reduced, which is a key step to later introduce the oxygen atom.\n\n5.  **Step (v) Diazotization:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt. 3-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → **4-tert-butyl-3-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n6.  **Step (vii) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. ...diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → **3-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n7.  **Step (viii) Desulfonation (Removal of Blocking Group):** 3-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4 → **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   Heating with dilute acid removes the sulfonic acid group. The resulting molecule, with an -OH group and a -tBu group ortho to each other, is 2-tert-butylphenol. This is a clever, high-yield synthesis of this important intermediate.\n\n8.  **Step (ix) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** 2-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   The phenol is converted to the desired ethoxy ether.\n\n9.  **Step (vi) Final Nitration:** 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This final step introduces the required nitro group. The directing effects are complex (-OEt at C1 directs to C4/C6; -tBu at C2 directs to C3/C5). However, nitration at C3, which is ortho to the bulky t-butyl group, is required. While potentially yielding a mixture, this is the final step to achieve the target structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the order of reagents listed in option B (specifically steps vi-ix) is jumbled from a linear synthesis perspective, the collection of reagents in Option B corresponds to a known, logical, and high-yield multi-step synthesis. The other options either use reactions that would fail or would not lead to the correct isomer in high yield. The core of the correct synthesis is the elegant use of a sulfonic acid blocking group to synthesize the key intermediate, 2-tert-butylphenol, which is only possible with the reagents and initial steps outlined in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break it down:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1. This is an ortho, para-directing and activating group.\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)** at position 2. This is an ortho, para-directing and activating group.\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3. This is a meta-directing and deactivating group.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern.\n*   The -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho to each other.\n*   The -tBu and -NO2 groups are ortho to each other.\n*   The -OEt and -NO2 groups are meta to each other.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring can be challenging, especially when dealing with competing directing effects. The final arrangement often requires a multi-step synthesis involving functional group transformations or the use of blocking groups.\n\n**2. Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies**\n\nLet's consider how the final arrangement might be achieved.\n\n*   **Final step is Nitration?** If we try to nitrate 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene, both the -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho, para-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. So, this is not a high-yield approach.\n\n*   **Final step is Williamson Ether Synthesis?** This would mean the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is a plausible penultimate step (`...-OH + NaOH/EtBr -> ...-OEt`). This sequence appears in the options.\n\n*   **Final step is Friedel-Crafts Alkylation?** If we try to alkylate 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the activating -OEt group (o,p-directing) would compete with the deactivating -NO2 group (m-directing). The -OEt group would direct the incoming t-butyl group to position 4 or 6, not position 2.\n\nThis analysis suggests that the OEt group is likely introduced late in the synthesis from a phenol, which itself is likely generated from an amine via a diazonium salt. This common synthetic route is:\n`-NH2 -> (NaNO2/HCl) -> -N2+ -> (H3O+) -> -OH -> (NaOH/EtBr) -> -OEt`.\nThis sequence of transformations appears in option A as steps (iii), (v), (vi), and (vii).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on chemical principles. All options list the starting material as benzene.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. Direct alkylation of aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and promoting meta-substitution, which is not the desired outcome. Therefore, this sequence is flawed.\n\n*   **Option B:** In step (iii), it sulfonates a nitro-compound, and in step (iv), it attempts diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`). Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2), but the amine formation step (`Fe/HCl`) only occurs much later at step (viii). The order of reactions is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** After forming an amine (step iv) and a diazonium salt (step v), it attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt (step vi). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; they are typically not subjected to further electrophilic aromatic substitution like nitration. This step is chemically unsound.\n\n*   **Option A:** This option remains. Let's trace its steps carefully to see if it leads to the desired product. The sequence contains a complete set of plausible reactions, including alkylation, nitration, reduction, the full aniline -> ether conversion, and a sulfonation/desulfonation pair which suggests the use of a blocking group. Although the order as written seems strange (sulfonation and desulfonation at the end), it is the only option without chemically invalid steps. Let's analyze the expected outcome from the main reaction pathway.\n\n    i)  `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: The tert-butyl group is o,p-directing. Due to steric hindrance, the major product is the para-isomer. -> **1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine. -> **4-tert-Butylaniline**.\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of an aniline. To avoid oxidation and control the reaction, the amino group is typically protected first (e.g., by acetylation to form acetanilide, -NHCOCH3). The acetamido group is a strong o,p-director. In 4-tert-butylacetanilide, both the -NHCOCH3 and -tBu groups direct to the same positions (2 and 6). Nitration will occur ortho to the stronger directing acetamido group. After hydrolysis of the protecting group, the product is -> **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n    v)  `NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. -> **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group. -> **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether. -> **1-Ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis product is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target molecule itself. There appears to be an issue with all the options or the problem statement. However, by eliminating options B, C, and D based on fundamentally incorrect chemical steps, option A is the only remaining possibility. While the straightforward interpretation of option A yields an isomer, it represents the most chemically sound sequence of *types* of reactions among the choices for a complex synthesis. It's possible a less common reaction pathway or regioselectivity is intended, or that there is an error in the question. In a multiple-choice scenario, the best approach is to eliminate the definitively incorrect options.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically invalid or incorrectly ordered reaction steps. Option A provides a sequence of plausible reactions, even though the standard regiochemical outcome does not yield the named target. By the process of elimination, A is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThe user wants to identify the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene with a high yield.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and the required steps.\n**Target Molecule**: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring with the following groups:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), an activating *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃), an activating *ortho, para*-director (but sterically bulky).\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a deactivating *meta*-director.\n\nA common final step for introducing an ethoxy group is a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This means the immediate precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This reaction involves using a base like NaOH followed by an ethylating agent like ethyl bromide (EtBr). This corresponds to step `(vii) NaOH/EtBr` in option C.\n\nThe phenol itself is often prepared from a primary aromatic amine via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. This means the precursor to the phenol would be **1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**. The reactions are treatment with `NaNO₂/HCl` followed by `H₃O⁺/Heat`. This matches steps `(v)` and `(vi)` in option C.\n\nSo, the core of the problem lies in the synthesis of **1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**. Following the sequence in option C backwards, this intermediate should be the product of step `(iv)`.\n\nLet's evaluate each option to find the most plausible route.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation fails on aniline. The lone pair of the amino group coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\nii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is bulky and directs *para*. The major product is **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\niii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Both the tert-butyl group (o,p-director) and the sulfonic acid group (m-director) direct the incoming nitro group to position 2 (relative to the sulfonic acid). The product is **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\nThis pathway creates a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, which cannot lead to the desired 1,2,3-substituted final product. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene → 4-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product).\niii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄`: Sulfonation → 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene-2-sulfonic acid.\niv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. At this stage of the synthesis, there is no amino group present. The molecule contains a nitro group and a sulfonic acid group. Therefore, this step is not possible. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nLet's analyze the sequence as written:\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\nii) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. For the synthesis to proceed towards a 1,2,3-product, the minor *ortho*-isomer (**2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**) must be used. This contradicts the \"high-yield\" claim but is necessary for the sequence to have any chance of succeeding.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. 2-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene → **2-tert-Butylaniline**.\niv) `HNO₃/H₂SO₄`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the most problematic step. Under the strongly acidic conditions, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Directing effects conflict, and the position needed for the final product (position 3) is ortho to both groups and thus extremely sterically hindered. This reaction would give a complex mixture of products with very low yield of the desired isomer.\nv) `NaNO₂/HCl`: Assuming the desired **1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene** was formed in the previous step, it would be converted to a diazonium salt.\nvi) `H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis gives the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nviii) `SO₃/H₂SO₄` ; ix) `dilute H₂SO₄`: The placement of sulfonation and desulfonation at the end of the synthesis is illogical.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible steps in their sequences. Option C outlines a sequence that, while suffering from severe yield and regioselectivity problems (especially in steps ii and iv) and having nonsensical final steps (viii, ix), is the only pathway that isn't definitively impossible from a fundamental reaction standpoint. By the process of elimination, it is the most likely intended answer, despite its significant flaws. The set of reagents in C is plausible for a complex synthesis involving blocking groups and functional group interconversions, even if they are presented in a confusing order.\n\nTherefore, despite its issues, option C represents the only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nAn analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution, as well as the potential for multi-step functional group transformations.\n\n### Target Molecule Analysis\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are **ortho** to each other.\n*   tert-Butyl and nitro are **ortho** to each other.\n*   Ethoxy and nitro are **meta** to each other.\n\n### Evaluation of Synthetic Pathways\n\nA sound synthetic strategy must install these groups in the correct positions with high yield. This involves considering the activating/deactivating nature and ortho-, para-, or meta-directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n*   **-C(CH₃)₃ (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho,para-director. It is very bulky, strongly favoring substitution at the para position to minimize steric hindrance.\n*   **-OCH₂CH₃ (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH₂ (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director. Can be converted to -OH via diazotization.\n*   **-SO₃H (sulfonic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director. Crucially, it is a reversible blocking group that can be removed with dilute acid and heat.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options step-by-step.\n\n#### **Option A**\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation):** Benzene is converted to tert-butylbenzene.\nii) **HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** The tert-butyl group directs the incoming nitro group. Due to the bulkiness of the tert-butyl group, the major product is overwhelmingly the para isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. The ortho isomer, which would be needed for a 1,2,3-pattern, is formed in very low yield. This makes the overall synthesis not \"high-yield\" if it relied on the ortho isomer. However, let's follow the major product pathway.\niii) **Fe/HCl (Reduction):** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\niv) **HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** The amino group is a very strong ortho,para-director. It must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation to form acetanilide) to prevent oxidation and to moderate its reactivity. The acetamido group (-NHCOCH₃) directs ortho to itself. The tert-butyl group is at the para position. Thus, nitration occurs at the position ortho to the acetamido group, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** (after hydrolysis of the amide).\nv) **NaNO₂/HCl (Diazotization):** The amino group of 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline is converted into a diazonium salt.\nvi) **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat (Hydrolysis):** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\nvii) **NaOH/EtBr (Williamson Ether Synthesis):** The phenolic -OH group is deprotonated by NaOH and then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\nviii) **SO₃/H₂SO₄ (Sulfonation)** and **ix) dilute H₂SO₄ (Desulfonation):** These final two steps would sulfonate the ring and then remove the sulfonic acid group, making them redundant and pointless.\n\nThe product of this sequence is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target itself. The substituents are in a 1,2,4-arrangement. Therefore, this option does not lead to the desired product.\n\n#### **Option B**\ni) **HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene.\nii) **Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline.\niii) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions fail on aniline because the amino group complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. Even if the amine is protected as an acetanilide, it directs the incoming tert-butyl group to the para position. This pathway does not work.\n\n#### **Option C** and **Option D**\nBoth of these options seem to contain typos or have steps in an illogical order. For instance, in Option C, step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), but there is no amino group present at that stage. Option D has two nitration steps in a row in a way that is synthetically unviable (`v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4`).\n\n### Conclusion\nUpon rigorous examination, none of the provided options describe a correct, high-yield synthesis for **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Option A describes a plausible multi-step synthesis, but it yields the wrong isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene). Options B, C, and D contain fundamental flaws in their proposed sequences. Given the constraints of the question, there is likely a significant error in the question itself, either in the name of the target compound or in the listed steps of the options.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" synthesis among the flawed choices, the sequence in A is the most elaborate and follows a logical (though ultimately incorrect for the stated target) progression of standard organic reactions. It's plausible that the intended target was the isomer produced by pathway A, and the name was written incorrectly in the prompt.\n\nGiven the significant flaws in all options for producing the named target, a definitive correct answer cannot be determined from the choices provided. However, pathway A represents a coherent synthesis of a related isomer.\n\nAfter re-evaluating the possibility of steric hindrance guiding the tert-butylation of 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene to the C2 position, it remains a less likely pathway compared to substitution at the more electronically favored and less hindered C6 position. The most chemically sound methods for creating the ortho-ortho relationship between the substituents involve a blocking group strategy, which is not correctly represented in any of the options to produce the final target molecule.\n\nTherefore, based on a rigorous analysis, none of the options are correct. But if we must assume an error in the question and choose the most coherent synthetic sequence presented, option A is the only one that represents a viable (though long) synthesis of *an* isomer. For the purpose of selecting an answer from the given list, it's the most likely intended sequence despite leading to the wrong named product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nAn analysis of the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, reveals a specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. To achieve this arrangement with high yield, the order of reactions is critical, as each substituent influences the position of subsequent additions (directing effects).\n\nLet's break down the required synthesis strategically and then evaluate the given options.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule and Retrosynthesis\n\n*   **Target:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents and their directing effects:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-C(CH3)3):** Activating, ortho, para-director. It is a very bulky group, which has significant steric effects.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Relative positions:** The -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho to each other. The -tBu and -NO2 groups are also ortho to each other. This crowded arrangement suggests that the bulky tert-butyl group should be introduced carefully, as it might be sterically hindered from entering a position between two existing groups.\n\nA common and effective strategy in complex aromatic syntheses is the use of a **blocking group**. A sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this. It can be added to the ring via sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) to block a specific position (usually the para position) and then removed later in the synthesis via desulfonation (heating with dilute acid).\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on these principles.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **Option A & D:** These options start with (i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form tert-butylbenzene, followed by (ii) nitration. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene overwhelmingly yields the *para* isomer (*p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene), with the desired *ortho* isomer being a minor product. A synthesis pathway relying on a minor product cannot be considered \"high-yield.\" Therefore, options A and D are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This option starts with (i) nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by (ii) reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), deactivating the ring and preventing the alkylation. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This option presents the most logical sequence of initial steps for controlling the regiochemistry to get an ortho-substituted product in high yield.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene:** This produces *tert-butylbenzene*.\n    *   **ii) SO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** The bulky tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to sterics, it strongly directs the incoming sulfonic acid group to the para position, yielding *p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid*. This blocks the para position.\n    *   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4 on p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** Now, the ring is nitrated. The tert-butyl group directs to its ortho positions (C2, C6), and the sulfonic acid group directs to its meta positions (C2, C6). Both groups cooperate, directing the nitro group to the position ortho to the tert-butyl group. A known strategy for synthesizing ortho-substituted tert-butylbenzene derivatives involves this exact sequence.\n    *   **Subsequent Steps:** Although the remainder of the steps in option B appear to be out of order or chemically nonsensical (e.g., step vi, nitrating a diazonium salt with mixed acid), the initial three steps represent the only plausible high-yield strategy among the choices to establish the required ortho-relationship between the tert-butyl group and another substituent. The options provided are likely flawed, but option B contains the core correct strategy for regiocontrol. The use of a blocking group is the key to solving this synthetic problem.\n\nBased on the critical strategic step of using a sulfonic acid blocking group to achieve the necessary ortho-substitution in high yield, Option B is the only choice that incorporates this correct initial sequence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern (all adjacent). Let's consider their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strong activator, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Weak activator, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nThe final arrangement has two ortho-, para-directors (-OEt, -tBu) ortho to each other, and a meta-director (-NO2) ortho to the -tBu group but meta to the very strong directing -OEt group. Direct introduction of the nitro group at C3 on a 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene precursor would be very difficult because the strong -OEt group directs incoming electrophiles to positions 4 and 6, not 3. This suggests a more complex strategy is required, likely involving blocking groups or functional group interconversions that change directing effects during the synthesis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final Reaction Step**\n\nMost of the options end with a step involving `NaOH/EtBr`. This is characteristic of the Williamson ether synthesis, which is used to form an ether from an alcohol (in this case, a phenol) and an alkyl halide.\n*   `Ar-OH + NaOH -> Ar-O- Na+` (forms a phenoxide)\n*   `Ar-O- Na+ + EtBr -> Ar-OEt + NaBr`\n\nThis strongly implies that the immediate precursor to our target molecule is a phenol: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The final step is the conversion of this phenol to the ethoxy ether.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options by Elimination**\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical feasibility and whether it leads to the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires an amino (-NH2) group. The product from step (iii) is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, which does not contain an amino group. Therefore, step (iv) is impossible as written. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts with benzene, nitrates it to nitrobenzene (i), then reduces it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is problematic because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards alkylation. Even if the reaction could be made to work (e.g., by protecting the amino group), it would lead to a mixture of o- and p-tert-butylaniline. Subsequent steps starting from either isomer do not lead to the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern (they typically lead to 1,2,4-isomers). **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Let's trace this path:\n    i. Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    ii. Nitration -> 1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major product)\n    iii. Reduction -> 4-tert-Butylaniline\n    iv. Nitration (under acidic conditions, -NH2 becomes -NH3+, a meta-director) -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitroaniline\n    v. Diazotization -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt\n    vi. Hydrolysis -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrophenol\n    vii. Etherification -> 1-Ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\n    The final product has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. This is the wrong isomer. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**4. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nBy elimination, Option A must be the correct choice. Let's analyze its sequence to confirm it is a viable pathway. This path uses a sulfonic acid group as a removable blocking group, a common and powerful strategy for controlling regiochemistry.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Product: **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) + SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation. The bulky t-Bu group sterically hinders ortho-substitution, so the reaction proceeds to the para position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n*   **iii) + HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration. The t-Bu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to t-Bu (and meta to -SO3H). Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This sets up the crucial ortho relationship between the future t-Bu and NO2 groups.\n*   **iv) + Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) + NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid salt**.\n*   **vi) + HNO3/H2SO4 and vii) + H3O+, H2O/Heat**: These two steps are best interpreted as a one-pot process. The diazonium salt is unstable and will react in the hot, acidic, aqueous, nitrating mixture. First, the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group upon heating with water (hydrolysis). Then, the resulting phenol is nitrated.\n    *   Phenol intermediate: **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Nitration of this phenol: The powerful activating -OH group directs the new -NO2 group. The positions ortho and para to the -OH are C3 and C5. While C5 is sterically less hindered, the electronic environment can favor nitration at C3. Assuming the reaction is driven to this product: **2-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **viii) + dilute H2SO4**: Desulfonation. Heating with dilute acid removes the sulfonic acid blocking group. Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. We have now successfully synthesized the key phenol precursor.\n*   **ix) + NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to its ethoxy ether. Final Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis detailed pathway correctly uses all the reagents listed in option A in a chemically logical sequence to arrive at the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   **C1: ethoxy group (-OEt)**. This is a strongly activating, *ortho, para* director.\n*   **C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)**. This is an activating, *ortho, para* director. It is very bulky.\n*   **C3: nitro group (-NO2)**. This is a strongly deactivating, *meta* director.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   All three substituents are adjacent (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n*   The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the deactivating group (-NO2). This is unusual for a direct electrophilic aromatic substitution and is a major clue. It suggests the activating group was not present in its final form during the nitration step, or its directing effect was overridden.\n*   The -tBu and -NO2 groups are ortho to each other.\n*   The -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nWe need to find a sequence of reactions that correctly installs these groups in the specified arrangement with high yield. We will consider the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. Due to its large size, the *para* product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is the major product. The required *ortho* isomer is the minor product, so this step has a low yield for the necessary intermediate.\niii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization. This step requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. However, the product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. Therefore, this reaction sequence is chemically incorrect as written. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The lone pair on the nitrogen of the amino group coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms an anilinium-like complex (-NH2-AlCl3), which is strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director. Thus, alkylation would yield primarily *meta*-tert-butylaniline, not the *ortho* or *para* isomers needed to build towards the target. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para position is blocked).\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group → diazonium salt.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt. Diazonium groups are extremely strong deactivators and meta-directors. Performing a nitration under these harsh conditions is not a standard or viable synthetic step and would likely lead to decomposition. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence is the most synthetically plausible, so let's analyze it in detail.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As noted before, this gives mainly the para-isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**, which we will assume is carried forward as the high-yield pathway.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group → **4-tert-butylaniline**.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The amine must be protected to prevent oxidation and to control regioselectivity. Typically, it is converted to an acetamide (-NHCOCH3). The acetamido group is a strong *o,p*-director. Since the *para* position is blocked by the -tBu group, nitration occurs *ortho* to the acetamido group. Product after hydrolysis is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. (An alternative pathway without protection involves forming the anilinium ion, -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both direct nitration to the position meta to the anilinium and ortho to the tBu, leading to **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. So the outcome is the same).\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amine (4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline) → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\nviii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step (vii). The strong directing groups (-OEt, -tBu) would direct sulfonation to the C6 position.\nix) `dilute H2SO4`: Desulfonation. This step removes the sulfonic acid group just added.\n\n**Conclusion on Option D:**\nSteps (i) through (vii) constitute a coherent, high-yield synthetic pathway using standard reactions. The final two steps (viii and ix) appear redundant as they add and then remove a sulfonic acid group. The main issue is that the product synthesized, 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (a 1,2,4-substituted isomer), is an isomer of the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (a 1,2,3-substituted isomer).\n\nHowever, comparing the four options, Options A, B, and C contain steps that are fundamentally flawed or non-viable. Option D, while leading to an isomer of the named product (likely due to an error in the question's premise), consists of a sequence of chemically sound and logical reactions. In the context of a multiple-choice question, Option D is the \"best\" answer because it represents a valid synthetic strategy, whereas the others do not.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nTo solve this problem, we need to devise a synthetic route for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This requires a careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents and the order in which they are introduced.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1.\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2.\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3.\n\nThe key substituent properties are:\n*   **-OEt:** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu:** Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which can influence the position of substitution.\n*   **-NO2:** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical feasibility and regioselectivity.\n\n**Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ...`\n*   Step (i) makes nitrobenzene, and step (ii) makes aniline.\n*   Step (iii) attempts a **Friedel-Crafts alkylation** on aniline. This reaction **fails**. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a strongly deactivated anilinium ion (-NH3+), which prevents the electrophilic alkylation reaction. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n*   This sequence is illogical. Step (v) is a diazotization, which requires an amine (formed in step iv). Step (vi) is a nitration. Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard procedure in a sequence like this; the diazonium salt is a highly reactive intermediate that is typically used immediately for substitution. This sequence does not lead to the desired product in a logical way. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n*   This sequence is impossible. Step (iv) is a **diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`)**, which requires a primary amino group (-NH2) to be present on the ring. The preceding steps (alkylation, nitration, sulfonation) do not form an amino group. Therefore, this reaction cannot be performed at this stage. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; ...`\n*   By elimination, this is the most likely answer. Let's verify the sequence:\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to its bulk, the *para* isomer is favored, but the *ortho* isomer (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed and can be separated.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 and -tBu groups are both *ortho, para*-directors. This step would have low yield for the desired 3-nitro isomer, but it's theoretically possible.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol (-OH group), forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: The phenol is converted to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding the final product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  Steps (viii) and (ix) are extraneous and likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the sequence in Option A has steps that would result in low yields of the desired isomer, it is the only option that is chemically plausible from start to finish. The other options contain fundamental flaws (reactions that fail or are performed in an impossible order). Therefore, Option A is the correct choice among the given alternatives.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's analyze the substitution pattern and the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1:** A strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at position 2:** A weakly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2) at position 3:** A strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -tBu is *ortho* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *meta* to -OEt.\n*   -NO2 is *ortho* to -tBu.\n\nThis complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern requires careful strategic planning, often involving blocking groups, to control the regioselectivity of the electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's evaluate each option step by step, considering the major products and standard reaction mechanisms.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is bulky, so nitration yields predominantly the *para* product, 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group gives 4-tert-butylaniline.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The strongly activating -NH2 group directs the new -NO2 group *ortho* to itself, yielding 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group gives the corresponding diazonium salt.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces -N2+ with -OH, yielding 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the -OH to -OEt, yielding **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\nThis final product has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4, which is the wrong isomer. The last two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are pointless. Thus, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene (major product).\niii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene. Both -tBu (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) direct the incoming -SO3H group to the same position (position 2 relative to nitro). This gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This step is for diazotization, which requires an amino group (-NH2). The substrate at this stage has no amino group. Therefore, this reaction step is impossible as written. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction → Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is problematic and not \"high-yield\". The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group to form a complex (-NH2-AlCl3), which is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, shutting down the desired alkylation. Furthermore, N-alkylation and polyalkylation are common side reactions. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option utilizes a blocking group strategy, which is the key to achieving this type of substitution pattern. Let's analyze the sequence.\n\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation. To minimize steric hindrance, the -SO3H group adds to the *para* position, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. Now, the -tBu group (o,p-directing) and the -SO3H group (m-directing) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to position 2 (and 6). This gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the -NO2 group to an -NH2 group gives **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\nAt this point, the sequence becomes problematic as written:\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. This reaction is performed at low temperatures (0-5 °C) as diazonium salts are unstable.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of the diazonium salt. This is highly unusual and problematic. Diazonium salts readily decompose, and subjecting one to harsh nitrating conditions is not a standard synthetic step.\n\nHowever, there is likely a typo in the question, and steps (v) and (vi) are swapped. Let's analyze the sequence with the corrected order (vi then v):\nvi') `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration) of 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. In acidic solution, the amine is protonated to -NH3+, which is meta-directing. However, there is an equilibrium, and the unprotonated -NH2 group is a powerful ortho-, para-director. Let's assume conditions are chosen to allow the -NH2 group to direct the substitution. The directing groups are -NH2 (at 2, o,p-director), -tBu (at 4, o,p-director), and -SO3H (at 1, m-director). All three groups direct the incoming electrophile to positions 3 and 5. For the desired product, we need nitration at position 3. While position 5 is sterically more accessible, let's assume conditions can favor position 3, yielding **3-nitro-2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\nv') `NaNO2/HCl` (Diazotization) of the amino group.\nvii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium group is replaced with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to give **3-nitro-2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\nviii) `dilute H2SO4`: Heating with dilute acid causes desulfonation, removing the -SO3H blocking group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\nix) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol (-OH) to an ethoxy ether (-OEt). This yields **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis logically constructed pathway, which uses all the reagents from Option C, successfully synthesizes the target molecule. Since options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed, Option C, despite the likely typo in the order of steps v and vi, is the only plausible choice as it outlines the correct overall strategy.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nRationale Breakdown:\n\nThe goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule first:\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1, tert-Butyl (-tBu) at C2, and Nitro (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   The -OEt and -tBu groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The -tBu and -NO2 groups are also *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The -OEt and -NO2 groups are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern requires a carefully planned sequence of reactions, paying close attention to the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n**Option A:** This sequence lists reagents in a jumbled order, with duplicated step numbers, making it impossible to follow as a coherent synthesis.\n\n**Option D:**\n1.  `i) HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is strongly deactivating.\n2.  `ii) Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: This attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming an ammonium salt (-NH3+). This deactivates the ring even more strongly than a nitro group, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** The sequence of reagents is chemically illogical. For example, it attempts diazotization (v) on a molecule that doesn't have a primary aromatic amine and nitration (vi) after diazotization under conditions that would not yield the target.\n\n**Option B:** This option presents the most chemically plausible, albeit challenging, route. Let's analyze it step-by-step, assuming we can control the regiochemistry to favor the desired isomers.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This Friedel-Crafts alkylation yields **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. While the para-isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is the major product due to sterics, the ortho-isomer (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To synthesize the target molecule, we must proceed with this ortho isomer.\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group yields **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. The powerful activating amino group (-NH2) must be protected first (e.g., by acetylation to -NHCOCH3), a step often implied in such problems. The acetylamino group is an ortho, para-director. The para position (C5) is sterically hindered by the adjacent C4 hydrogen and the C6 hydrogen. The ortho position (C3) is also sterically hindered by the groups at C1 and C2. However, this is the only way to introduce the nitro group at the required C3 position. The product after deprotection is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the primary amino group in 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline produces a diazonium salt. This is the first step of the Sandmeyer reaction or related substitutions.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by warming in acidic water, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming the final ether product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n8.  **viii) and ix):** The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are superfluous and do not fit in this synthesis, suggesting they may be distractors or errors in the question.\n\nDespite the challenges with yield and regioselectivity at certain steps (ii and iv), this sequence of functional group transformations is the only one provided that logically builds the complex target molecule from the starting material.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents at each step is required. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern, which is often challenging to achieve due to the ortho, para, and meta directing effects of various functional groups.\n\nLet's break down the structure of the final product:\n*   **A benzene ring** is the starting scaffold.\n*   **An ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position C1 (a strongly activating, ortho/para director).\n*   **A tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position C2 (an activating, ortho/para director).\n*   **A nitro group (-NO2)** at position C3 (a strongly deactivating, meta director).\n\nA thorough evaluation of the provided options reveals that options A, B, and D contain chemically unfeasible steps, such as attempting to perform diazotization on a compound without an amino group or trying to nitrate a diazonium salt. This makes them incorrect pathways.\n\nOption C presents the most plausible sequence of reaction *types*, although the regiochemical outcome requires careful consideration. Let's analyze this pathway step-by-step:\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation which attaches a tert-butyl group to the benzene ring, forming tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director, but due to its significant steric bulk, the major product of subsequent reactions is often the para-substituted isomer.\n\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a nitration reaction. The nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields primarily p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** This reaction reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH2), converting p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene into p-tert-butylaniline (also known as 4-tert-butylaniline).\n\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is the second nitration step, now on p-tert-butylaniline. The directing effects must be carefully considered. The amino group is a very strong ortho, para-director, while the tert-butyl group is a weaker ortho, para-director. Typically, an amino group would be protected (e.g., by acetylation) before nitration. However, if the nitration proceeds on the unprotected aniline, the directing effects must be analyzed. One possible, though not always dominant, pathway for nitrating anilines in strong acid involves the protonation of the amino group to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). This ion is a deactivating, meta-director. In the case of the p-tert-butylanilinium ion, the -NH3+ group at C1 would direct nitration to the C3 position, while the activating -tBu group at C4 directs to the C3 position. This synergistic effect would lead to the formation of 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\n\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the primary amino group of 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline into a diazonium salt.\n\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, replacing the -N2+ group with an -OH group, yielding 3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\n\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This final step is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenolic -OH group is deprotonated by NaOH and then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether, yielding the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Note: the IUPAC priority rules change, causing the ethoxy-bearing carbon to be numbered C1).\n\nWhile the regiochemical outcome of step (iv) can be complex, the sequence of transformations presented in option C is the only one that is chemically logical and avoids impossible reaction steps, leading to a structure consistent with the target molecule's substitution pattern. The final two steps listed in option C, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, appear to be superfluous or incorrectly placed, but the core synthesis pathway (i-vii) remains the only viable option among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nAn analysis of the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, reveals a 1,2,3-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. A high-yield synthesis of such a molecule requires careful control of the regiochemistry at each step, making use of the directing effects of the substituents.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene, then reducing it to aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a strongly deactivating anilinium complex which prevents the electrophilic substitution. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    This sequence is chemically illogical. For instance, step (iv) attempts to perform diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) on a nitro-sulfonated intermediate. Diazotization is a reaction for primary aromatic amines, which are only formed much later in the proposed sequence at step (viii) (Fe/HCl). The order of reactions is incorrect. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    This sequence also contains a chemically nonsensical step. After forming a diazonium salt in step (v), step (vi) suggests a nitration reaction. Diazonium salts are generally not nitrated in this manner; they are typically used in substitution or coupling reactions. This step makes the entire sequence incorrect as written. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    This sequence is composed of chemically plausible steps, so let's analyze the regiochemical outcome:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** This Friedel-Crafts alkylation yields **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene:** The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is the para isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A high-yield synthesis would proceed with this major isomer.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction of the nitro group:** `Fe/HCl` reduces the nitrobenzene derivative to **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline:** In a strong acidic medium like `HNO3/H2SO4`, the basic amino group is protonated to form an anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a **meta-director**. The t-butyl group at position 4 is an ortho,para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions meta to the anilinium ion, i.e., positions 3 and 5. This leads to the formation of **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group of 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** Heating the diazonium salt in aqueous acid yields a phenol: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is reacted with sodium hydroxide and ethyl bromide to form the corresponding ether: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  The remaining steps (viii, ix) are sulfonation and desulfonation, which are not necessary at this stage and suggest a possible flaw in the question's construction, but the core synthesis pathway is established by steps i-vii.\n\nThe final product from this logical sequence is `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`, which is a 1,3,4-substituted isomer, not the target 1,2,3-substituted `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. However, Options B, C, and D contain fundamentally impossible reaction sequences. Option A describes a sequence of valid chemical reactions that would lead to a high yield of a specific isomer, leveraging the meta-directing effect of the anilinium ion. It is the only plausible reaction sequence among the choices, assuming there is an error in the chemical name of the target product in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
