The search results confirm the fundamental principles I used:\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy and Momentum:** This is the cornerstone of solving this problem.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a particle is E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor and m is the rest mass.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momentum of a particle is p = γmv. An alternative and more direct formula is p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²)/c, which can be expressed using the Lorentz factor as p = mc * sqrt(γ² - 1).\n*   **Electron-Positron Annihilation:** When an electron and a positron collide, they annihilate, producing two photons to conserve both energy and momentum. The photons have equal energy and are emitted at equal and opposite angles to the initial line of collision if the net transverse momentum is zero, which is the case here.\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is p = E/c.\n\nThe derived formula for the angle is:\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(γ_e² - 1) - sqrt(γ_p² - 1)) / (γ_e + γ_p)`\nwhere θ is the angle of one photon with respect to the horizontal axis. The total angle between the two photons is 2θ.\n\nLet's re-calculate the values:\n*   γ_e = 4\n*   γ_p = 2\n*   cos(θ) = (sqrt(4² - 1) - sqrt(2² - 1)) / (4 + 2)\n*   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n*   cos(θ) ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205) / 6 ≈ 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.35682\n*   θ = arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69.09°\n*   Total angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.09° = 138.18°\n\nThis value is extremely close to 138. The steps, formulas, and calculation are all verified.\n\nFinal check of the question:\n*   Electron from left, γ=4.\n*   Positron from right, γ=2.\n*   Annihilate, 2 photons.\n*   Photons have same energy.\n*   One upper-right, one lower-right.\n*   Find the angle between the photons.\n\nThe setup implies conservation of momentum in the y-direction is satisfied by the symmetric emission of the photons (θ and -θ). The conservation of energy and x-momentum are used to find the angle. The logic holds. The calculation is confirmed. The answer is D.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe problem describes a collision between an electron and a positron, resulting in their annihilation and the production of two photons. To solve this, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Initial State:\n\n*   **Electron:** Moving from the left with a Lorentz factor (γe) of 4.\n*   **Positron:** Moving from the right with a Lorentz factor (γp) of 2.\n*   The rest mass of an electron and a positron are identical (me).\n\n### Final State:\n\n*   **Two photons:** They have equal energy (Eγ) and move away from the collision point. One moves in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right direction, forming an angle θ with the horizontal axis.\n\n### Applying Conservation Laws:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Initial Energy (Ei) = Energy of electron + Energy of positron = γe*me*c² + γp*me*c²\n    *   Final Energy (Ef) = Energy of photon 1 + Energy of photon 2 = Eγ + Eγ = 2Eγ\n    *   Therefore: (γe + γp) * me*c² = 2Eγ\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. Momentum is a vector, so we analyze its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components separately.\n    *   The relativistic momentum of a particle is p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n    *   **Initial Momentum (pi):**\n        *   The electron moves in the positive x-direction, and the positron in the negative x-direction.\n        *   pi,x = pe,x + pp,x = √(γe² - 1) * me*c - √(γp² - 1) * me*c\n        *   pi,y = 0, as both particles move along the horizontal axis.\n    *   **Final Momentum (pf):**\n        *   The momentum of a photon is pγ = Eγ / c.\n        *   The two photons move at angles +θ and -θ to the horizontal.\n        *   pf,x = pγ1,x + pγ2,x = (Eγ / c) * cos(θ) + (Eγ / c) * cos(θ) = 2 * (Eγ / c) * cos(θ)\n        *   pf,y = pγ1,y + pγ2,y = (Eγ / c) * sin(θ) - (Eγ / c) * sin(θ) = 0. The vertical components cancel out, which is consistent with the initial conditions.\n\n### Calculation:\n\nBy equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\nme*c * (√(γe² - 1) - √(γp² - 1)) = 2 * (Eγ / c) * cos(θ)\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can express the energy of a single photon as:\nEγ = (γe + γp) * me*c² / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for Eγ into the momentum equation:\nme*c * (√(γe² - 1) - √(γp² - 1)) = 2 * [((γe + γp) * me*c² / 2) / c] * cos(θ)\n\nSimplifying the equation by canceling out terms (me*c):\n√(γe² - 1) - √(γp² - 1) = (γe + γp) * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can solve for the angle θ by plugging in the given Lorentz factors (γe = 4, γp = 2):\ncos(θ) = (√(4² - 1) - √(2² - 1)) / (4 + 2)\ncos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6\ncos(θ) ≈ 2.141 / 6\ncos(θ) ≈ 0.3568\n\nθ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\nTotal Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum from special relativity.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Define the System and Initial Conditions**\n\n*   We have an electron (e⁻) and a positron (e⁺). They have the same rest mass, which we'll call $m_e$.\n*   Let's set up a coordinate system where the collision happens along the horizontal x-axis.\n*   The electron moves from left to right, so its velocity is in the +x direction. Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n*   The positron moves from right to left, so its velocity is in the -x direction. Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Initial Energy**\n\nThe energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n\n*   Energy of the electron: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$\n*   Energy of the positron: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$\n\nThe total initial energy of the system is the sum of their energies:\n$E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Initial Momentum**\n\nThe momentum of a relativistic particle can be calculated using the formula $p = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\cdot mc$. Momentum is a vector quantity.\n\n*   Momentum of the electron (in the +x direction):\n    $p_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{15} \\cdot m_e c$\n*   Momentum of the positron (in the -x direction):\n    $p_p = \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot m_e c$\n\nThe total initial momentum is the vector sum. Since they are moving in opposite directions along the x-axis:\n$P_{initial} = p_e - p_p = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$\nThe total momentum is in the +x direction.\n\n**4. Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced.\n*   **Energy:** According to the law of conservation of energy, the total final energy must equal the total initial energy.\n    $E_{final} = E_{initial} = 6 m_e c^2$\n    The problem states that the two photons have the same energy ($E_{\\gamma1} = E_{\\gamma2} = E_\\gamma$).\n    Therefore, $E_{\\gamma1} + E_{\\gamma2} = 2E_\\gamma = 6 m_e c^2$, which means the energy of each photon is $E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n\n*   **Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$.\n    So, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is $p_\\gamma = (3 m_e c^2) / c = 3 m_e c$.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation of Momentum to Find the Angle**\n\nThe initial momentum was purely horizontal. To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitude, they must be emitted at symmetric angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be $\\theta$. One photon goes up at angle $\\theta$, and the other goes down at angle $-\\theta$.\n\nThe total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum:\n$P_{final} = p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) + p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nNow, we equate the initial and final momentum:\n$P_{initial} = P_{final}$\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nSubstitute the value we found for $p_\\gamma$:\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos(\\theta)$\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 6 m_e c \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nWe can cancel $m_e c$ from both sides and solve for $\\cos(\\theta)$:\n$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n$\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n\n$\\cos(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n\n$\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons. This is the sum of the angle of the first photon above the horizontal and the second photon below the horizontal, which is $2\\theta$.\n\nAngle = $2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the angle between the two photons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Physical Principles**\n\n*   **System:** An electron and a positron are moving towards each other and will annihilate.\n*   **Electron:** Moves from left to right (we'll define this as the +x direction). Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n*   **Positron:** Moves from right to left (the -x direction). Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n*   **Annihilation:** The collision results in two photons.\n*   **Governing Principles:** The process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds (as indicated by Lorentz factors > 1), we must use the formulas from Special Relativity.\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\nWe need to find the total energy and total momentum of the electron-positron system before the collision. Let $m_e$ be the rest mass of both the electron and the positron, and $c$ be the speed of light.\n\n*   **For the Electron:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: We can find the momentum using the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$.\n        *   $(4 m_e c^2)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $16 (m_e c^2)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $(p_e c)^2 = 15 (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $p_e = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$.\n    *   Since it moves in the +x direction, its momentum is $p_{e,x} = +\\sqrt{15} m_e c$.\n\n*   **For the Positron:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: Using the same relation:\n        *   $(2 m_e c^2)^2 = (p_p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $4 (m_e c^2)^2 = (p_p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $(p_p c)^2 = 3 (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $p_p = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$.\n    *   Since it moves in the -x direction, its momentum is $p_{p,x} = -\\sqrt{3} m_e c$.\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Total Momentum (x-direction): $P_{x, initial} = p_{e,x} + p_{p,x} = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n    *   Total Momentum (y-direction): $P_{y, initial} = 0$ (since both particles move along the horizontal axis).\n\n**3. Define the Final State**\n\nThe final state consists of two photons.\n\n*   **Properties:** They have the same energy, which we'll call $E_\\gamma$. For a photon, its momentum is $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$.\n*   **Directions:** One moves upper-right, and the other lower-right. Because the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero, the final y-momenta of the two photons must cancel out. Since their energies (and thus momentum magnitudes) are equal, their angles with the x-axis must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let's call these angles $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$.\n\n*   **Total Final System:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{final} = E_\\gamma + E_\\gamma = 2 E_\\gamma$.\n    *   Total Momentum (x-direction): The x-component of each photon's momentum is $p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta = (E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta$.\n        *   $P_{x, final} = (E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta + (E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta = 2(E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta$.\n    *   Total Momentum (y-direction): The y-components are $(E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta$ and $(E_\\gamma/c)\\sin(-\\theta) = -(E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta$.\n        *   $P_{y, final} = (E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta - (E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta = 0$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nNow we equate the initial and final properties.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $6 m_e c^2 = 2 E_\\gamma$\n    *   $E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$. This is the energy of each photon.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (x-direction):**\n    *   $P_{x, initial} = P_{x, final}$\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2(E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta$.\n    *   Now, substitute the value of $E_\\gamma$ we just found:\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2((3 m_e c^2)/c)\\cos\\theta$\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 6 m_e c \\cos\\theta$.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nWe can now solve the momentum equation for the angle $\\theta$.\n\n*   Cancel the common term $m_e c$ from both sides:\n    *   $\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos\\theta$\n*   Isolate $\\cos\\theta$:\n    *   $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n*   Calculate the numerical value:\n    *   $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n    *   $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n    *   $\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n*   Find the angle $\\theta$:\n    *   $\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$.\n\n**6. Find the Angle Between the Photons**\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons. One photon has a direction of $\\theta$ relative to the x-axis, and the other has a direction of $-\\theta$.\n\n*   Total Angle = $\\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta$.\n*   Total Angle $\\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$.\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Relativistic Formulas:** It is crucial to use relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$) and momentum ($E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$), not classical ones.\n2.  **Momentum Direction:** The direction of motion is critical. The positron's momentum is negative because it moves in the -x direction. A mistake here would lead to an incorrect total initial momentum.\n3.  **Symmetry in Final State:** The fact that the photons have equal energy and the initial transverse (y) momentum is zero forces the final state to be symmetric. The angles must be $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$.\n4.  **Final Question:** The question asks for the angle *between* the photons ($2\\theta$), not the angle of one photon with the axis ($\\theta$). This is a common trap.\n\nBased on the analysis, the angle between the photons is approximately 138 degrees.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe reasoning and the physics principles applied are correct. The calculation steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Energy:**\n    *   Electron Energy: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c^2 = 4 * m_e * c^2`\n    *   Positron Energy: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c^2 = 2 * m_e * c^2`\n    *   Total Initial Energy: `E_i = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * m_e * c^2 = 6 * m_e * c^2`\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Momentum:**\n    *   Electron Momentum: `p_e*c = sqrt(E_e^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2) = sqrt(16 - 1) * m_e*c^2 = sqrt(15) * m_e*c`\n    *   Positron Momentum: `p_p*c = sqrt(E_p^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2) = sqrt(4 - 1) * m_e*c^2 = sqrt(3) * m_e*c`\n    *   Total Initial Momentum (in the x-direction): `p_i_x = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c`\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws to the Final State (2 Photons):**\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The total energy of the two photons is `E_f = E_i = 6 * m_e*c^2`. Since they have equal energy, each photon has `E_γ = 3 * m_e*c^2`.\n    *   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, `E = pc`. So, the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3 * m_e*c`.\n    *   **Momentum Conservation:**\n        *   The initial momentum in the y-direction is 0. For the final y-momentum to be 0, the photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (`θ` and `-θ`) to the x-axis.\n        *   The final momentum in the x-direction must equal the initial x-momentum: `p_f_x = p_γ*cos(θ) + p_γ*cos(-θ) = 2*p_γ*cos(θ)`.\n        *   `p_i_x = p_f_x` => `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c = 2 * (3 * m_e*c) * cos(θ)`\n        *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n        *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Angle:**\n    *   The angle `θ` is `acos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n    *   The code execution calculated this value: `2 * degrees(acos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)) ≈ 138.19°`.\n\nThis calculated value is closest to the option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe initial state of the system is now calculated. The total energy is 6.0 (in units of `m_e*c^2`) and the total momentum in the x-direction is ~2.141 (in units of `m_e*c`).\n\nMy next step is to use the conservation laws to find the angle between the two photons.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons. Since they have equal energy, each photon has `E_photon = E_total_initial / 2`.\n*   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E = pc`. In our units where `c=1`, `p_photon = E_photon`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum is entirely in the x-direction. The final momentum is the sum of the two photon momenta. Since one photon goes up-right (`+θ`) and the other down-right (`-θ`), their y-momenta cancel. Their x-momenta add up: `p_total_initial_x = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ)`.\n\nI can now solve for `θ` and then find the total angle `2θ`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Values from the previous step\nE_total_initial = 6.0\np_total_initial_x = 2.14093253863854\n\n# Energy of a single photon\nE_photon = E_total_initial / 2\n\n# Momentum of a single photon (since E = pc and c=1, p = E)\np_photon = E_photon\n\n# From conservation of momentum: p_total_initial_x = 2 * p_photon * cos(theta)\n# We can rearrange to solve for cos(theta)\ncos_theta = p_total_initial_x / (2 * p_photon)\n\n# Calculate theta in degrees\ntheta_rad = np.arccos(cos_theta)\ntheta_deg = np.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta\ntotal_angle = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(f\"Energy of one photon: {E_photon}\")\nprint(f\"cos(theta): {cos_theta}\")\nprint(f\"Angle theta (degrees): {theta_deg}\")\nprint(f\"Total angle between photons (2*theta): {total_angle}\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Energy of one photon: 3.0\ncos(theta): 0.35682208977309\nAngle theta (degrees): 69.09484255211069\nTotal angle between photons (2*theta): 138.18968510422138\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe search results confirm the fundamental principles used in the calculation. Specifically, the conservation of energy and momentum is the correct approach for this type of problem. The formulas for relativistic energy (E = γmc²) and momentum (p = √(γ² - 1)mc) are standard. The relationship between a photon's energy and momentum (p = E/c) is also correct.\n\nThe search results also discuss that when the initial net momentum is not zero (as is the case here), the angle between the photons will deviate from 180 degrees. This aligns with the problem statement and the calculation performed. The calculation correctly determined the net initial momentum and used it to find the final momentum components of the photons.\n\nThe steps taken were:\n1.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy:** Sum the relativistic energies of the electron and positron.\n    *   E_initial = (γ_electron + γ_positron) * m * c²\n2.  **Calculate Final Photon Energy:** Apply energy conservation. Since the two resulting photons have equal energy, the energy of each is half the total initial energy.\n    *   E_final = 2 * E_photon = E_initial  => E_photon = E_initial / 2\n3.  **Calculate Total Initial Momentum:** Calculate the relativistic momentum of the electron and positron and find the net momentum. Since they are moving in opposite directions along the same axis, this is a subtraction of magnitudes.\n    *   P_initial = p_electron - p_positron = (√(γ_electron² - 1) - √(γ_positron² - 1)) * m * c\n4.  **Calculate Final Momentum:** The final momentum is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta. Since the photons have equal energy, their momenta have equal magnitude (p_photon = E_photon / c).

Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's consider the horizontal (x-axis) as the direction of motion. The electron moves from the left (+x direction) and the positron from the right (-x direction).\n\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = √(γ² - 1)mc.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e) = √(4² - 1)mc = √(15)mc (in the +x direction).\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p) = √(2² - 1)mc = √(3)mc (in the -x direction).\n    *   Total initial momentum (P_initial) is the vector sum:\n        P_initial_x = √(15)mc - √(3)mc = (√15 - √3)mc\n        Since there is no initial vertical motion, P_initial_y = 0.\n\n    After the collision, we have two photons. The momentum of a photon is p = E/c.\n    *   Momentum of each photon (p_ph) = E_ph / c = (3mc²) / c = 3mc.\n\n    The photons move away in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Because the initial vertical momentum was zero, the final vertical momenta of the two photons must cancel each other out. This happens if they are emitted at symmetric angles, θ and -θ, with respect to the horizontal axis.\n\n    *   The horizontal component of the final momentum (P_final_x) is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum:\n        P_final_x = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ) = 6mc * cos(θ).\n    *   The vertical component of the final momentum (P_final_y) is:\n        P_final_y = p_ph * sin(θ) + p_ph * sin(-θ) = p_ph * sin(θ) - p_ph * sin(θ) = 0. This confirms our symmetric angle assumption.\n\n    Equating the horizontal components of the initial and final momentum:\n    (√15 - √3)mc = 6mc * cos(θ)\n\n    We can cancel 'mc' from both sides:\n    cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n3.  **Calculate the Angle**\n\n    Now, we calculate the value of θ.\n    *   √15 ≈ 3.873\n    *   √3 ≈ 1.732\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees\n\n    The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons. This is the sum of the angle of the first photon above the horizontal and the angle of the second photon below the horizontal.\n    *   Total Angle = θ - (-θ) = 2θ\n    *   Total Angle ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\nFirst, we establish the energy and momentum of the electron and positron before the collision. The rest mass of both an electron and a positron is denoted by *m₀*.\n\n*   **Electron**: Moving from the left with a Lorentz factor (γ_e) of 4.\n*   **Positron**: Moving from the right with a Lorentz factor (γ_p) of 2.\n\nThe total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γ * m₀ * c², where *c* is the speed of light.\n\nThe relativistic momentum (p) is given by p = √(γ² - 1) * m₀ * c.\n\n*   **Initial Total Energy (E_i)**:\n    The total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron.\n    E_i = (γ_e * m₀ * c²) + (γ_p * m₀ * c²) = (4 + 2) * m₀ * c² = 6 * m₀ * c²\n\n*   **Initial Total Momentum (P_i)**:\n    Momentum is a vector. Assuming the electron moves in the positive x-direction and the positron in the negative x-direction, the total initial momentum is:\n    p_e = √(4² - 1) * m₀ * c = √15 * m₀ * c\n    p_p = √(2² - 1) * m₀ * c = √3 * m₀ * c\n    P_i = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3) * m₀ * c\n\n### 2.

Apply Conservation Laws\n\nThe total energy and momentum of the system must be conserved.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy**:\n    The initial energy equals the final energy. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons.\n    E_i = E_f\n    6 * m₀ * c² = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph\n    Therefore, the energy of each photon is:\n    E_ph = 3 * m₀ * c²\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by p_ph = E_ph / c.\n    p_ph = (3 * m₀ * c²) / c = 3 * m₀ * c\n\n    The total final momentum (P_f) is the vector sum of the two photon momenta. Due to the symmetric angles, the vertical components of their momenta cancel each other out, and the horizontal components add up.\n    P_f = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)\n    P_f = 2 * (3 * m₀ * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m₀ * c * cos(θ)\n\n    Now, we equate the initial and final momentum:\n    P_i = P_f\n    (√15 - √3) * m₀ * c = 6 * m₀ * c * cos(θ)\n\n### 4.

Due to momentum conservation in the y-direction, their angles with the horizontal axis must be equal and opposite (θ and -θ).\n        *   The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum: p_fx = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ).\n        *   The total final momentum in the y-direction is p_fy = p_ph * sin(θ) - p_ph * sin(θ) = 0, which is consistent with the initial state.\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction: (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ).\n\n3.  **Calculating the Angle:**\n    *   From the momentum conservation equation, we can solve for the angle θ:\n        cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n    *   Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n        cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.357\n    *   Taking the arccosine gives θ ≈ 69.1°.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is 2θ.\n        Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°.\n\nThis result is very close to 138.

We use natural units where the electron rest mass `m_e = 1` and the speed of light `c = 1`.\n    *   Relativistic energy is given by `E = γ * m_e * c^2`, which simplifies to `E = γ`.\n    *   Initial Energy (Electron + Positron): `E_initial = γ_electron + γ_positron = 4 + 2 = 6`.\n    *   After annihilation, two photons of equal energy `E_photon` are produced.\n    *   Final Energy: `E_final = 2 * E_photon`.\n    *   By conservation, `E_initial = E_final`, so `6 = 2 * E_photon`, which means each photon has an energy `E_photon = 3`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system is also conserved.\n    *   Relativistic momentum is `p = sqrt(γ^2 - 1)`.\n    *   Initial Momentum (along the x-axis):\n        *   Electron (moving right): `p_electron = +sqrt(4^2 - 1) = +sqrt(15)`.\n        *   Positron (moving left): `p_positron = -sqrt(2^2 - 1) = -sqrt(3)`.\n        *   Total Initial Momentum: `p_initial = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.141`.\n    *   Final Momentum:\n        *   For a photon, momentum `p = E`, so each photon has a momentum magnitude of `p_photon = 3`.\n        *   To conserve momentum in the transverse (up/down) direction, the photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis.\n        *   The total final momentum in the x-direction is `p_final = p_photon * cos(θ) + p_photon * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ) = 6 * cos(θ)`.\n\n3.  **Solving for the Angle:**\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum: `p_initial = p_final`.\n    *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`.\n    *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ≈ 0.3568`.\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2 * θ`.\n    *   Total Angle = `2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`.\n\nThis value is extremely close to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Define the System and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe problem involves an electron-positron annihilation, which must obey the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. We will analyze the system before and after the collision. The rest energy of an electron (and a positron) is denoted as `mc²`, which has a value of approximately 0.511 MeV.\n\n**2. Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n    *   Total energy (E_e) is given by the relativistic energy formula E = γmc².\n        *   E_e = 4 * mc²\n    *   The momentum (p) can be found using the energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n        *   (p_e * c)² = E_e² - (mc²)² = (4mc²)² - (mc²)² = 15(mc²)²\n        *   p_e * c = √15 * mc²\n    *   Since the electron moves from the left, its momentum is in the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n    *   Total energy (E_p) = 2 * mc²\n    *   Momentum (p_p):\n        *   (p_p * c)² = E_p² - (mc²)² = (2mc²)² - (mc²)² = 3(mc²)²\n        *   p_p * c = √3 * mc²\n    *   Since the positron moves from the right, its momentum is in the negative x-direction.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   Total Energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²\n    *   Total Momentum (P_initial) = p_e + p_p = (√15 * mc²/c) - (√3 * mc²/c) = (√15 - √3) * mc²/c along the x-axis.\n\n**3. Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\n*   The final state consists of two photons.\n*   It is given that the photons have equal energy. Let the energy of each photon be E_ph.\n*   From the conservation of energy:\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   6mc² = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is E_ph = 3mc².\n*   For a photon, the magnitude of its momentum is related to its energy by p = E/c.\n    *   p_ph = E_ph / c = 3mc²/c.\n*   The photons move away at angles to the horizontal axis. Since one moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\", and the initial momentum had no vertical (y-axis) component, their vertical momenta must be equal and opposite. This means they are emitted at the same angle θ relative to the horizontal axis, one above and one below.\n\n**4.

Each photon has a momentum of magnitude `3mc`.\n\n3.  **Momentum Conservation and Final Angle**\n    *   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero. To conserve momentum, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. Since the two photons have equal momentum magnitude, they must be emitted at symmetric angles to the horizontal axis, let's say `θ` and `-θ`.\n    *   The total final momentum in the x-direction `P_f` is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta.\n        *   `P_f = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(-θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n        *   Substituting `p_γ = 3mc`: `P_f = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ) = 6mc cos(θ)`\n    *   **Equating Initial and Final Momentum:** `P_i = P_f`\n        *   `(√15 - √3)mc = 6mc cos(θ)`\n\n4.  **Calculation of the Angle**\n    *   We can cancel `mc` from both sides and solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        *   `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n    *   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n        *   `√15 ≈ 3.873`\n        *   `√3 ≈ 1.732`\n        *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    *   The angle `θ` is the arccosine of this value:\n        *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n    *   The question asks for the angle **between** the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n        *   Total Angle = `2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points\n\n*   **Methodology:** The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers (at least 13 out of 15) correctly apply the conservation laws and derive the same formula for the angle.

This appears to be a simple mistake in the final step of matching the result to the given options and does not reflect an error in the physics or calculation. For example, Answer 2 calculates 138.2° but selects A (96), and Answer 4 calculates 138.2° but selects B (172).\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct physical derivation and calculation robustly point to an angle of approximately 138.2°.

An alternative and more direct formula is p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²)/c, which can be expressed using the Lorentz factor as p = mc * sqrt(γ² - 1).\n*   **Electron-Positron Annihilation:** When an electron and a positron collide, they annihilate, producing two photons to conserve both energy and momentum. The photons have equal energy and are emitted at equal and opposite angles to the initial line of collision if the net transverse momentum is zero, which is the case here.\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is p = E/c.\n\nThe derived formula for the angle is:\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(γ_e² - 1) - sqrt(γ_p² - 1)) / (γ_e + γ_p)`\nwhere θ is the angle of one photon with respect to the horizontal axis.

To solve this, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Initial State:\n\n*   **Electron:** Moving from the left with a Lorentz factor (γe) of 4.\n*   **Positron:** Moving from the right with a Lorentz factor (γp) of 2.\n*   The rest mass of an electron and a positron are identical (me).\n\n### Final State:\n\n*   **Two photons:** They have equal energy (Eγ) and move away from the collision point. One moves in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right direction, forming an angle θ with the horizontal axis.\n\n### Applying Conservation Laws:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Initial Energy (Ei) = Energy of electron + Energy of positron = γe*me*c² + γp*me*c²\n    *   Final Energy (Ef) = Energy of photon 1 + Energy of photon 2 = Eγ + Eγ = 2Eγ\n    *   Therefore: (γe + γp) * me*c² = 2Eγ\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. Momentum is a vector, so we analyze its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components separately.\n    *   The relativistic momentum of a particle is p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n    *   **Initial Momentum (pi):**\n        *   The electron moves in the positive x-direction, and the positron in the negative x-direction.\n        *   pi,x = pe,x + pp,x = √(γe² - 1) * me*c - √(γp² - 1) * me*c\n        *   pi,y = 0, as both particles move along the horizontal axis.\n    *   **Final Momentum (pf):**\n        *   The momentum of a photon is pγ = Eγ / c.\n        *   The two photons move at angles +θ and -θ to the horizontal.\n        *   pf,x = pγ1,x + pγ2,x = (Eγ / c) * cos(θ) + (Eγ / c) * cos(θ) = 2 * (Eγ / c) * cos(θ)\n        *   pf,y = pγ1,y + pγ2,y = (Eγ / c) * sin(θ) - (Eγ / c) * sin(θ) = 0. The vertical components cancel out, which is consistent with the initial conditions.\n\n### Calculation:\n\nBy equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\nme*c * (√(γe² - 1) - √(γp² - 1)) = 2 * (Eγ / c) * cos(θ)\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can express the energy of a single photon as:\nEγ = (γe + γp) * me*c² / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for Eγ into the momentum equation:\nme*c * (√(γe² - 1) - √(γp² - 1)) = 2 * [((γe + γp) * me*c² / 2) / c] * cos(θ)\n\nSimplifying the equation by canceling out terms (me*c):\n√(γe² - 1) - √(γp² - 1) = (γe + γp) * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can solve for the angle θ by plugging in the given Lorentz factors (γe = 4, γp = 2):\ncos(θ) = (√(4² - 1) - √(2² - 1)) / (4 + 2)\ncos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6\ncos(θ) ≈ 2.141 / 6\ncos(θ) ≈ 0.3568\n\nθ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\nTotal Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum from special relativity.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Define the System and Initial Conditions**\n\n*   We have an electron (e⁻) and a positron (e⁺). They have the same rest mass, which we'll call $m_e$.\n*   Let's set up a coordinate system where the collision happens along the horizontal x-axis.\n*   The electron moves from left to right, so its velocity is in the +x direction. Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n*   The positron moves from right to left, so its velocity is in the -x direction. Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Initial Energy**\n\nThe energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n\n*   Energy of the electron: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$\n*   Energy of the positron: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$\n\nThe total initial energy of the system is the sum of their energies:\n$E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Initial Momentum**\n\nThe momentum of a relativistic particle can be calculated using the formula $p = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\cdot mc$. Momentum is a vector quantity.\n\n*   Momentum of the electron (in the +x direction):\n    $p_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{15} \\cdot m_e c$\n*   Momentum of the positron (in the -x direction):\n    $p_p = \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot m_e c$\n\nThe total initial momentum is the vector sum. Since they are moving in opposite directions along the x-axis:\n$P_{initial} = p_e - p_p = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$\nThe total momentum is in the +x direction.\n\n**4. Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced.\n*   **Energy:** According to the law of conservation of energy, the total final energy must equal the total initial energy.\n    $E_{final} = E_{initial} = 6 m_e c^2$\n    The problem states that the two photons have the same energy ($E_{\\gamma1} = E_{\\gamma2} = E_\\gamma$).\n    Therefore, $E_{\\gamma1} + E_{\\gamma2} = 2E_\\gamma = 6 m_e c^2$, which means the energy of each photon is $E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n\n*   **Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$.\n    So, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is $p_\\gamma = (3 m_e c^2) / c = 3 m_e c$.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation of Momentum to Find the Angle**\n\nThe initial momentum was purely horizontal. To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitude, they must be emitted at symmetric angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be $\\theta$. One photon goes up at angle $\\theta$, and the other goes down at angle $-\\theta$.\n\nThe total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum:\n$P_{final} = p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) + p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nNow, we equate the initial and final momentum:\n$P_{initial} = P_{final}$\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nSubstitute the value we found for $p_\\gamma$:\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos(\\theta)$\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 6 m_e c \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nWe can cancel $m_e c$ from both sides and solve for $\\cos(\\theta)$:\n$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n$\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n\n$\\cos(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n\n$\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons. This is the sum of the angle of the first photon above the horizontal and the second photon below the horizontal, which is $2\\theta$.\n\nAngle = $2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the angle between the two photons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1.

Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds (as indicated by Lorentz factors > 1), we must use the formulas from Special Relativity.\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\nWe need to find the total energy and total momentum of the electron-positron system before the collision. Let $m_e$ be the rest mass of both the electron and the positron, and $c$ be the speed of light.\n\n*   **For the Electron:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: We can find the momentum using the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$.\n        *   $(4 m_e c^2)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $16 (m_e c^2)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $(p_e c)^2 = 15 (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $p_e = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$.\n    *   Since it moves in the +x direction, its momentum is $p_{e,x} = +\\sqrt{15} m_e c$.\n\n*   **For the Positron:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: Using the same relation:\n        *   $(2 m_e c^2)^2 = (p_p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $4 (m_e c^2)^2 = (p_p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $(p_p c)^2 = 3 (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $p_p = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$.\n    *   Since it moves in the -x direction, its momentum is $p_{p,x} = -\\sqrt{3} m_e c$.\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Total Momentum (x-direction): $P_{x, initial} = p_{e,x} + p_{p,x} = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n    *   Total Momentum (y-direction): $P_{y, initial} = 0$ (since both particles move along the horizontal axis).\n\n**3. Define the Final State**\n\nThe final state consists of two photons.\n\n*   **Properties:** They have the same energy, which we'll call $E_\\gamma$. For a photon, its momentum is $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$.\n*   **Directions:** One moves upper-right, and the other lower-right. Because the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero, the final y-momenta of the two photons must cancel out. Since their energies (and thus momentum magnitudes) are equal, their angles with the x-axis must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let's call these angles $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$.\n\n*   **Total Final System:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{final} = E_\\gamma + E_\\gamma = 2 E_\\gamma$.\n    *   Total Momentum (x-direction): The x-component of each photon's momentum is $p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta = (E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta$.\n        *   $P_{x, final} = (E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta + (E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta = 2(E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta$.\n    *   Total Momentum (y-direction): The y-components are $(E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta$ and $(E_\\gamma/c)\\sin(-\\theta) = -(E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta$.\n        *   $P_{y, final} = (E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta - (E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta = 0$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nNow we equate the initial and final properties.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $6 m_e c^2 = 2 E_\\gamma$\n    *   $E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$. This is the energy of each photon.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (x-direction):**\n    *   $P_{x, initial} = P_{x, final}$\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2(E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta$.\n    *   Now, substitute the value of $E_\\gamma$ we just found:\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2((3 m_e c^2)/c)\\cos\\theta$\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 6 m_e c \\cos\\theta$.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nWe can now solve the momentum equation for the angle $\\theta$.\n\n*   Cancel the common term $m_e c$ from both sides:\n    *   $\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos\\theta$\n*   Isolate $\\cos\\theta$:\n    *   $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n*   Calculate the numerical value:\n    *   $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n    *   $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n    *   $\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n*   Find the angle $\\theta$:\n    *   $\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$.\n\n**6. Find the Angle Between the Photons**\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons. One photon has a direction of $\\theta$ relative to the x-axis, and the other has a direction of $-\\theta$.\n\n*   Total Angle = $\\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta$.\n*   Total Angle $\\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$.\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Relativistic Formulas:** It is crucial to use relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$) and momentum ($E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$), not classical ones.\n2.  **Momentum Direction:** The direction of motion is critical. The positron's momentum is negative because it moves in the -x direction. A mistake here would lead to an incorrect total initial momentum.\n3.  **Symmetry in Final State:** The fact that the photons have equal energy and the initial transverse (y) momentum is zero forces the final state to be symmetric. The angles must be $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$.\n4.  **Final Question:** The question asks for the angle *between* the photons ($2\\theta$), not the angle of one photon with the axis ($\\theta$). This is a common trap.\n\nBased on the analysis, the angle between the photons is approximately 138 degrees.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe reasoning and the physics principles applied are correct. The calculation steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Energy:**\n    *   Electron Energy: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c^2 = 4 * m_e * c^2`\n    *   Positron Energy: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c^2 = 2 * m_e * c^2`\n    *   Total Initial Energy: `E_i = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * m_e * c^2 = 6 * m_e * c^2`\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Momentum:**\n    *   Electron Momentum: `p_e*c = sqrt(E_e^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2) = sqrt(16 - 1) * m_e*c^2 = sqrt(15) * m_e*c`\n    *   Positron Momentum: `p_p*c = sqrt(E_p^2 - (m_e*c^2)^2) = sqrt(4 - 1) * m_e*c^2 = sqrt(3) * m_e*c`\n    *   Total Initial Momentum (in the x-direction): `p_i_x = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c`\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws to the Final State (2 Photons):**\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The total energy of the two photons is `E_f = E_i = 6 * m_e*c^2`. Since they have equal energy, each photon has `E_γ = 3 * m_e*c^2`.\n    *   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, `E = pc`. So, the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3 * m_e*c`.\n    *   **Momentum Conservation:**\n        *   The initial momentum in the y-direction is 0. For the final y-momentum to be 0, the photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (`θ` and `-θ`) to the x-axis.\n        *   The final momentum in the x-direction must equal the initial x-momentum: `p_f_x = p_γ*cos(θ) + p_γ*cos(-θ) = 2*p_γ*cos(θ)`.\n        *   `p_i_x = p_f_x` => `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c = 2 * (3 * m_e*c) * cos(θ)`\n        *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n        *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Angle:**\n    *   The angle `θ` is `acos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n    *   The code execution calculated this value: `2 * degrees(acos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)) ≈ 138.19°`.\n\nThis calculated value is closest to the option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe initial state of the system is now calculated. The total energy is 6.0 (in units of `m_e*c^2`) and the total momentum in the x-direction is ~2.141 (in units of `m_e*c`).\n\nMy next step is to use the conservation laws to find the angle between the two photons.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons. Since they have equal energy, each photon has `E_photon = E_total_initial / 2`.\n*   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E = pc`. In our units where `c=1`, `p_photon = E_photon`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum is entirely in the x-direction. The final momentum is the sum of the two photon momenta. Since one photon goes up-right (`+θ`) and the other down-right (`-θ`), their y-momenta cancel. Their x-momenta add up: `p_total_initial_x = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ)`.\n\nI can now solve for `θ` and then find the total angle `2θ`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Values from the previous step\nE_total_initial = 6.0\np_total_initial_x = 2.14093253863854\n\n# Energy of a single photon\nE_photon = E_total_initial / 2\n\n# Momentum of a single photon (since E = pc and c=1, p = E)\np_photon = E_photon\n\n# From conservation of momentum: p_total_initial_x = 2 * p_photon * cos(theta)\n# We can rearrange to solve for cos(theta)\ncos_theta = p_total_initial_x / (2 * p_photon)\n\n# Calculate theta in degrees\ntheta_rad = np.arccos(cos_theta)\ntheta_deg = np.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta\ntotal_angle = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(f\"Energy of one photon: {E_photon}\")\nprint(f\"cos(theta): {cos_theta}\")\nprint(f\"Angle theta (degrees): {theta_deg}\")\nprint(f\"Total angle between photons (2*theta): {total_angle}\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Energy of one photon: 3.0\ncos(theta): 0.35682208977309\nAngle theta (degrees): 69.09484255211069\nTotal angle between photons (2*theta): 138.18968510422138\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe search results confirm the fundamental principles used in the calculation. Specifically, the conservation of energy and momentum is the correct approach for this type of problem. The formulas for relativistic energy (E = γmc²) and momentum (p = √(γ² - 1)mc) are standard. The relationship between a photon's energy and momentum (p = E/c) is also correct.\n\nThe search results also discuss that when the initial net momentum is not zero (as is the case here), the angle between the photons will deviate from 180 degrees. This aligns with the problem statement and the calculation performed. The calculation correctly determined the net initial momentum and used it to find the final momentum components of the photons.\n\nThe steps taken were:\n1.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy:** Sum the relativistic energies of the electron and positron.\n    *   E_initial = (γ_electron + γ_positron) * m * c²\n2.  **Calculate Final Photon Energy:** Apply energy conservation. Since the two resulting photons have equal energy, the energy of each is half the total initial energy.\n    *   E_final = 2 * E_photon = E_initial  => E_photon = E_initial / 2\n3.  **Calculate Total Initial Momentum:** Calculate the relativistic momentum of the electron and positron and find the net momentum. Since they are moving in opposite directions along the same axis, this is a subtraction of magnitudes.\n    *   P_initial = p_electron - p_positron = (√(γ_electron² - 1) - √(γ_positron² - 1)) * m * c\n4.  **Calculate Final Momentum:** The final momentum is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta. Since the photons have equal energy, their momenta have equal magnitude (p_photon = E_photon / c). Due to conservation of momentum in the perpendicular direction, the angles with the horizontal axis must be equal and opposite (θ and -θ).\n    *   P_final_x = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ)\n5.  **Solve for the Angle:** Equate the initial and final x-momentum to solve for the angle θ.\n    *   P_initial = P_final_x\n6.  **Find the Angle Between Photons:** The total angle between the two photons is 2θ.\n\nThe calculation performed followed these steps precisely.\n\n*   **Initial Energy:** E_initial = (4 + 2)mc² = 6mc²\n*   **Photon Energy:** E_photon = 6mc² / 2 = 3mc²\n*   **Initial Momentum:** P_initial = (√(4² - 1) - √(2² - 1))mc = (√15 - √3)mc\n*   **Photon Momentum:** p_photon = 3mc² / c = 3mc\n*   **Final Momentum:** P_final_x = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ) = 6mc * cos(θ)\n*   **Equating Momenta:** (√15 - √3)mc = 6mc * cos(θ)\n*   **Solving for θ:** cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n*   **Angle between photons:** 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis result is very close to 138. The logic is sound and confirmed by the principles outlined in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the question and options:\nA) 74\nB) 138\nC) 96\nD) 172\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 138.2 degrees matches option B.\n\nFinal answer is B.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of linear momentum from special relativity.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**\n\n    The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n\n    *   The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   The rest mass of an electron and a positron are the same, let's call it 'm'.\n    *   Energy of the electron (E_e) = γ_e * mc² = 4mc²\n    *   Energy of the positron (E_p) = γ_p * mc² = 2mc²\n    *   Total initial energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²\n\n    After the annihilation, two photons of equal energy (E_ph) are produced.\n    *   Total final energy (E_final) = E_ph + E_ph = 2E_ph\n\n    Equating initial and final energy:\n    6mc² = 2E_ph\n    E_ph = 3mc²\n    So, each photon has an energy of 3mc².\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**\n\n    The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's consider the horizontal (x-axis) as the direction of motion. The electron moves from the left (+x direction) and the positron from the right (-x direction).\n\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = √(γ² - 1)mc.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e) = √(4² - 1)mc = √(15)mc (in the +x direction).\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p) = √(2² - 1)mc = √(3)mc (in the -x direction).\n    *   Total initial momentum (P_initial) is the vector sum:\n        P_initial_x = √(15)mc - √(3)mc = (√15 - √3)mc\n        Since there is no initial vertical motion, P_initial_y = 0.\n\n    After the collision, we have two photons. The momentum of a photon is p = E/c.\n    *   Momentum of each photon (p_ph) = E_ph / c = (3mc²) / c = 3mc.\n\n    The photons move away in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Because the initial vertical momentum was zero, the final vertical momenta of the two photons must cancel each other out. This happens if they are emitted at symmetric angles, θ and -θ, with respect to the horizontal axis.\n\n    *   The horizontal component of the final momentum (P_final_x) is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum:\n        P_final_x = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ) = 6mc * cos(θ).\n    *   The vertical component of the final momentum (P_final_y) is:\n        P_final_y = p_ph * sin(θ) + p_ph * sin(-θ) = p_ph * sin(θ) - p_ph * sin(θ) = 0. This confirms our symmetric angle assumption.\n\n    Equating the horizontal components of the initial and final momentum:\n    (√15 - √3)mc = 6mc * cos(θ)\n\n    We can cancel 'mc' from both sides:\n    cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n3.  **Calculate the Angle**\n\n    Now, we calculate the value of θ.\n    *   √15 ≈ 3.873\n    *   √3 ≈ 1.732\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees\n\n    The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons. This is the sum of the angle of the first photon above the horizontal and the angle of the second photon below the horizontal.\n    *   Total Angle = θ - (-θ) = 2θ\n    *   Total Angle ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\nFirst, we establish the energy and momentum of the electron and positron before the collision. The rest mass of both an electron and a positron is denoted by *m₀*.\n\n*   **Electron**: Moving from the left with a Lorentz factor (γ_e) of 4.\n*   **Positron**: Moving from the right with a Lorentz factor (γ_p) of 2.\n\nThe total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γ * m₀ * c², where *c* is the speed of light.\n\nThe relativistic momentum (p) is given by p = √(γ² - 1) * m₀ * c.\n\n*   **Initial Total Energy (E_i)**:\n    The total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron.\n    E_i = (γ_e * m₀ * c²) + (γ_p * m₀ * c²) = (4 + 2) * m₀ * c² = 6 * m₀ * c²\n\n*   **Initial Total Momentum (P_i)**:\n    Momentum is a vector. Assuming the electron moves in the positive x-direction and the positron in the negative x-direction, the total initial momentum is:\n    p_e = √(4² - 1) * m₀ * c = √15 * m₀ * c\n    p_p = √(2² - 1) * m₀ * c = √3 * m₀ * c\n    P_i = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3) * m₀ * c\n\n### 2. Define the Final State\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced.\n\n*   They have the same energy, which we'll call E_ph.\n*   One photon moves upper-right at an angle *θ* to the horizontal axis.\n*   The other moves lower-right at an angle *-θ* to the horizontal axis.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\nThe total energy and momentum of the system must be conserved.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy**:\n    The initial energy equals the final energy. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons.\n    E_i = E_f\n    6 * m₀ * c² = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph\n    Therefore, the energy of each photon is:\n    E_ph = 3 * m₀ * c²\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by p_ph = E_ph / c.\n    p_ph = (3 * m₀ * c²) / c = 3 * m₀ * c\n\n    The total final momentum (P_f) is the vector sum of the two photon momenta. Due to the symmetric angles, the vertical components of their momenta cancel each other out, and the horizontal components add up.\n    P_f = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)\n    P_f = 2 * (3 * m₀ * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m₀ * c * cos(θ)\n\n    Now, we equate the initial and final momentum:\n    P_i = P_f\n    (√15 - √3) * m₀ * c = 6 * m₀ * c * cos(θ)\n\n### 4.

When an electron and its antiparticle, the positron, collide, they annihilate, converting their mass and kinetic energy into high-energy photons (gamma rays).\n\nTo determine the angle between the two resulting photons, we must apply these conservation laws to the collision.\n\n### Analysis of the Collision\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n    *   The initial energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and the positron. The energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n        *   Electron energy (E_e) = 4 * m_e * c²\n        *   Positron energy (E_p) = 2 * m_e * c²\n        *   Total initial energy (E_i) = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n    *   The final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons (E_f = E_ph1 + E_ph2). Since the problem states the photons have equal energy (E_ph1 = E_ph2 = E_ph), the total final energy is E_f = 2 * E_ph.\n    *   Equating initial and final energy: 6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_ph, which gives the energy of a single photon as E_ph = 3 * m_e * c².\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system is also conserved. Momentum is a vector, so we must consider its components. Let's assume the electron moves in the positive x-direction and the positron in the negative x-direction.\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n        *   Electron momentum (p_e) = √(4² - 1) * m_e * c = √15 * m_e * c (in the +x direction).\n        *   Positron momentum (p_p) = -√(2² - 1) * m_e * c = -√3 * m_e * c (in the -x direction).\n        *   Total initial momentum (p_ix) = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c. The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is p = E/c. For each photon, the momentum magnitude is p_ph = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n    *   The photons are emitted in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Due to momentum conservation in the y-direction, their angles with the horizontal axis must be equal and opposite (θ and -θ).\n        *   The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum: p_fx = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ).\n        *   The total final momentum in the y-direction is p_fy = p_ph * sin(θ) - p_ph * sin(θ) = 0, which is consistent with the initial state.\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction: (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ).\n\n3.  **Calculating the Angle:**\n    *   From the momentum conservation equation, we can solve for the angle θ:\n        cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n    *   Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n        cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.357\n    *   Taking the arccosine gives θ ≈ 69.1°.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is 2θ.\n        Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°.\n\nThis result is very close to 138.

We use natural units where the electron rest mass `m_e = 1` and the speed of light `c = 1`.\n    *   Relativistic energy is given by `E = γ * m_e * c^2`, which simplifies to `E = γ`.\n    *   Initial Energy (Electron + Positron): `E_initial = γ_electron + γ_positron = 4 + 2 = 6`.\n    *   After annihilation, two photons of equal energy `E_photon` are produced.\n    *   Final Energy: `E_final = 2 * E_photon`.\n    *   By conservation, `E_initial = E_final`, so `6 = 2 * E_photon`, which means each photon has an energy `E_photon = 3`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system is also conserved.\n    *   Relativistic momentum is `p = sqrt(γ^2 - 1)`.\n    *   Initial Momentum (along the x-axis):\n        *   Electron (moving right): `p_electron = +sqrt(4^2 - 1) = +sqrt(15)`.\n        *   Positron (moving left): `p_positron = -sqrt(2^2 - 1) = -sqrt(3)`.\n        *   Total Initial Momentum: `p_initial = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.141`.\n    *   Final Momentum:\n        *   For a photon, momentum `p = E`, so each photon has a momentum magnitude of `p_photon = 3`.\n        *   To conserve momentum in the transverse (up/down) direction, the photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles `+θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal axis.\n        *   The total final momentum in the x-direction is `p_final = p_photon * cos(θ) + p_photon * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ) = 6 * cos(θ)`.\n\n3.  **Solving for the Angle:**\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum: `p_initial = p_final`.\n    *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`.\n    *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ≈ 0.3568`.\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2 * θ`.\n    *   Total Angle = `2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`.\n\nThis value is extremely close to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Define the System and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe problem involves an electron-positron annihilation, which must obey the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. We will analyze the system before and after the collision. The rest energy of an electron (and a positron) is denoted as `mc²`, which has a value of approximately 0.511 MeV.\n\n**2. Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n    *   Total energy (E_e) is given by the relativistic energy formula E = γmc².\n        *   E_e = 4 * mc²\n    *   The momentum (p) can be found using the energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n        *   (p_e * c)² = E_e² - (mc²)² = (4mc²)² - (mc²)² = 15(mc²)²\n        *   p_e * c = √15 * mc²\n    *   Since the electron moves from the left, its momentum is in the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n    *   Total energy (E_p) = 2 * mc²\n    *   Momentum (p_p):\n        *   (p_p * c)² = E_p² - (mc²)² = (2mc²)² - (mc²)² = 3(mc²)²\n        *   p_p * c = √3 * mc²\n    *   Since the positron moves from the right, its momentum is in the negative x-direction.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   Total Energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²\n    *   Total Momentum (P_initial) = p_e + p_p = (√15 * mc²/c) - (√3 * mc²/c) = (√15 - √3) * mc²/c along the x-axis.\n\n**3. Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\n*   The final state consists of two photons.\n*   It is given that the photons have equal energy. Let the energy of each photon be E_ph.\n*   From the conservation of energy:\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   6mc² = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is E_ph = 3mc².\n*   For a photon, the magnitude of its momentum is related to its energy by p = E/c.\n    *   p_ph = E_ph / c = 3mc²/c.\n*   The photons move away at angles to the horizontal axis. Since one moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\", and the initial momentum had no vertical (y-axis) component, their vertical momenta must be equal and opposite. This means they are emitted at the same angle θ relative to the horizontal axis, one above and one below.\n\n**4. Applying Momentum Conservation**\n\n*   The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum.\n    *   P_final = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)\n*   Now, we set the initial momentum equal to the final momentum:\n    *   P_initial = P_final\n    *   (√15 - √3) * mc²/c = 2 * (3mc²/c) * cos(θ)\n*   We can cancel the `mc²/c` term from both sides:\n    *   √15 - √3 = 6 * cos(θ)\n*   Solving for cos(θ):\n    *   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n**5.
