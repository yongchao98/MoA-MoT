The decay must proceed through an intermediate state, which, according to the dipole selection rules, must be a *p* state (*l*=1). The options provided suggest the intermediate state is one of the |2,1,m⟩ (2p) states.\n\n### Analysis of the Transition Route\n\n1.  **First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩**\n    *   The initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩.\n    *   According to the electric dipole selection rules, the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be Δ*l* = ±1. Since the initial state has *l*=0, the intermediate state must have *l'*=1.\n    *   The selection rule for the magnetic quantum number is Δ*m* = 0, ±1. Since the initial state has *m*=0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   Therefore, the allowed intermediate states are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n    *   The final state is |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩.\n    *   For a transition from an intermediate state with *l'*=1, the change is Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δ*m* = 0 - *m'*, must be 0, ±1. This condition is met for all possible intermediate *m'* values (-1, 0, 1).\n    *   Thus, all three proposed pathways are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### Calculation of Probabilities\n\nThe question asks for the probability corresponding to a specific transition route. This refers to the branching ratio for that particular decay channel. The branching ratio is the fraction of decays that proceed through a specific path.\n\nLet's consider an ensemble of hydrogen atoms in the initial |3,0,0⟩ state. The first step of the decay is the transition to one of the three degenerate |2,1,m'⟩ states.\n\n*   The rate of a transition is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element.\n*   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric.\n*   Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to be left in any of the three |2,1,m'⟩ states.\n\nThis means the transition rates from |3,0,0⟩ to each of the |2,1,m'⟩ states are equal:\nΓ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩)\n\nThe total rate of decay from the 3s state to the 2p states is the sum of these individual rates:\nΓ<sub>total</sub> = Γ(→|2,1,1⟩) + Γ(→|2,1,0⟩) + Γ(→|2,1,-1⟩)\n\nThe probability, or branching ratio, for any single path (e.g., through the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩) is the rate for that path divided by the total rate:\nP(route via |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(→|2,1,0⟩) / Γ<sub>total</sub>\n\nSince the three individual rates are equal, let's call them Γ<sub>0</sub>. Then Γ<sub>total</sub> = 3Γ<sub>0</sub>.\nP(route via |2,1,0⟩) = Γ<sub>0</sub> / (3Γ<sub>0</sub>) = 1/3.\n\nThe same logic applies to the other two routes, giving them each a probability of 1/3.\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, it will decay to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state, as this is the only lower-energy state accessible via a dipole transition. The probability of this second step is 1. Therefore, the probability of the entire cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability for the route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 - Incorrect probability.\nB) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 - Correct route and probability.\nC) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 - Incorrect probability.\nD) ⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 - Incomplete and incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state occurs via the emission of photons. In the non-relativistic theory, the most probable transitions are electric dipole (E1) transitions, which are governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Δl = ±1\n*   Δm = 0, ±1\n\nThe initial state of the hydrogen atom is given as |n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩, and the final state is the ground state |1, 0, 0⟩. The decay is stated to occur via two dipole transitions, which implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n**First Transition: |3, 0, 0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n\nApplying the selection rules to the initial state:\n*   Since l = 0, the change in the orbital quantum number must be Δl = +1. Therefore, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   Since m = 0, the change in the magnetic quantum number can be Δm = 0, ±1. This means the possible values for m' are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nFor a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease (n' < n). Given the options, the intermediate state has n'=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, 0⟩, |2, 1, 1⟩, and |2, 1, -1⟩.\n\n**Second Transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩**\n\nNow, we consider the transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩:\n*   The change in the orbital quantum number is Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = 0 - m', depends on the intermediate state:\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, 0⟩, then Δm = 0, which is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, 1⟩, then Δm = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, -1⟩, then Δm = +1, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three decay routes are permitted by the selection rules:\n1.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n2.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 1⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n3.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, -1⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n\n**Transition Probabilities**\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the initial |3, 0, 0⟩ state, the probabilities of transitioning to any of the |2, 1, m'⟩ states (where m' = -1, 0, 1) are equal. This means that each of the three possible decay paths has an equal probability. Since there are three possible routes, the probability for any single route is 1/3.\n\nThe transition route mentioned in options A and B is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe probability for this specific route is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) suggests a probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$, which is incorrect.\n*   B) suggests a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$, which is correct.\n*   C) and D) suggest a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$ for other valid routes, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct transition route and corresponding probability are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn electric dipole transition in the hydrogen atom is governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n,l,m\\rangle$:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The change in the principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted, i.e., $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The problem specifies that the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n\n**Step 1: First transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $m$:** $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Second transition $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $m$:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n\nAll three possible routes are allowed by the selection rules. Now we must determine the probability for each route.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the probability**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route $|i\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle \\rightarrow |f\\rangle$ is given by the branching ratio of the first transition, $P(|i\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle)$, multiplied by the probability of the second transition, $P(|k\\rangle \\rightarrow |f\\rangle)$.\n\nFor the second transition, the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can only decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition (since there are no other lower energy states with $l=0$ or $l=2$ that it can decay to). Therefore, the probability of the second step is 1 for any of the intermediate states.\n$P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to finding the branching ratios for the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must populate each of the possible final magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) with equal probability.\n\nSince there are three possible final $m'$ states, the probability (branching ratio) for the transition to any one of them is $1/3$.\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nThe total probability for each of the three possible cascade routes is therefore $1/3$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the options**\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a valid route. The calculated probability is $1/3$. The option gives $\\frac{1}{4}$. Incorrect.\nB) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a valid route. The calculated probability is $1/3$. The option gives $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect.\nC) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a valid route. The calculated probability is $1/3$. The option gives $\\frac{1}{4}$. Incorrect.\nD) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a valid route. The calculated probability is $1/3$. The option gives $\\frac{1}{3}$. Correct.\n\nOnly option D provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We need to find a valid decay path and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an atomic transition to be allowed under the E1 approximation, the quantum numbers of the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must satisfy the following rules:\n    *   **Parity change:** The parity of the state must change. This is equivalent to the rule for the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be:\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number, $n$, can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n$ is unrestricted), but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition:** The atom starts in the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $l=0$. So, $l_k - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ cannot be negative, the intermediate state must have $l_k = 1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $m=0$. So, $m_k - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m_k = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   **Applying $n_k < n_i$:** The initial state has $n_i=3$. So, the intermediate state must have $n_k < 3$. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n_k=2$.\n    *   **Possible Intermediate States:** Based on the selection rules and the options, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition:** The atom decays from the intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if this is an allowed transition.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $l_k=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The final state has $m_f=0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m_k$.\n        *   If $m_k = -1$, $\\Delta m = 1$. (Allowed)\n        *   If $m_k = 0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. (Allowed)\n        *   If $m_k = 1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. (Allowed)\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, all the routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities:** The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n    *   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle$):**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. The three possible final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy. Due to the symmetry of the initial state and the interaction, the probability of decaying into any of these three substates is equal.\n        Since there are 3 equally likely outcomes, the probability for any specific one is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of $m_k = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        We need to find the branching ratio for this decay. This is the rate of this specific transition divided by the total decay rate of the state $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$. Let's find all possible decay channels for $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the final state must have $l_f = 0$ or $l_f = 2$.\n        *   The rule $n_f < n_k=2$ means $n_f$ must be 1.\n        *   A state with $n=1$ must have $l=0$ (the 1s state). A state with $l=2$ requires $n \\ge 3$.\n        *   Therefore, the only possible final state for a decay from the $n=2, l=1$ level is the $n=1, l=0$ level.\n        *   This means that once the atom reaches any of the $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states, it is guaranteed to decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. The branching ratio is 1.\n        $P(|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Probability of the Cascade:**\n    The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n    *   For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n        $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe only option that provides a valid route with the correct probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the excited state |3,0,0> to the ground state |1,0,0>. This decay happens not in a single step, but via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole transition. We need to find a valid intermediate state that forms a possible decay path and calculate the probability of the atom taking that specific path.\n\n### 2. Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers |n, l, m>:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or ±1.\n*   **Δn**: The principal quantum number change is not restricted (but must decrease for emission).\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>. The decay path is |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>.\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>**\n*   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, the final l' must be 1.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Since m=0, the final m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n*   Applying Δn: n must decrease. Since it's a two-step process to reach n=1, the intermediate state must have n' < 3. The most likely transition is to the nearest available level, which is n'=2. So, n'=2.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   |2, 1, 0>\n*   |2, 1, 1>\n*   |2, 1, -1>\n\n**Second transition: |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>**\nLet's check if our possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n*   Final state: n''=1, l''=0, m''=0.\n*   For all three intermediate states (|2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, |2,1,-1>), we have n'=2, l'=1.\n*   Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n*   Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'.\n    *   If m'=0, Δm=0. (Allowed)\n    *   If m'=1, Δm=-1. (Allowed)\n    *   If m'=-1, Δm=+1. (Allowed)\n\nSo, all three paths are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability of the Transition Route\nThe probability of a specific cascade (a sequence of decays) is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\nP(route) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2)\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 2: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\nThe branching ratio is the probability of a specific decay channel compared to all possible decay channels. A state |2,1,m'> (a 2p state) can only decay to a lower energy level. The only lower energy level is n=1. For n=1, the only possible value for l is l=0. Thus, the only possible final state via a single-photon dipole transition is |1,0,0>. Since this is the only possible decay route, its branching ratio is 1.\n*   BR(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\nThe branching ratio for the decay into a specific state |2,1,m'> is the ratio of the rate of that specific transition to the total decay rate of the initial state |3,0,0>.\n*   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) / Rate_total(|3,0,0>)\n\nThe dominant decay channel for the |3,0,0> (3s) state is to the |2,1,m'> (2p) states. Other decays, like the two-photon decay to 1s, are much slower and can be neglected.\n*   Rate_total(|3,0,0>) ≈ Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) + Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>)\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element. A key physical principle is that an initial state with l=0 (an s-state) is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space. Therefore, when it decays by emitting a photon, the emission must be isotropic on average, meaning it has no preference for which m' sublevel to populate. This implies that the transition rates to each of the possible final m' states must be equal.\n*   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>)\n\nLet's call this rate `R`. Then the total rate is `R + R + R = 3R`.\nThe branching ratio for the decay to any specific m' state is:\n*   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = R / (3R) = 1/3\n\nThis can be formally verified using the Wigner-Eckart theorem and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which show that the angular part of the transition matrix element has the same magnitude for all three final m' states when the initial state has l=0.\n\n**Total Probability for each Route**\nNow we can calculate the total probability for each of the three possible routes:\n*   P(route via m'=0) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n*   P(route via m'=1) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n*   P(route via m'=-1) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.

Execution**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify Selection Rules and Intermediate States**\n    The selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ must change ($\\Delta n \\neq 0$).\n\n    The decay process is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n        *   For a decay cascade, the energy must decrease at each step, so $1 \\le n' < 3$. The intermediate state must be able to decay to $n=1$, so $n' > 1$. This leaves $n'=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Final state: $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Let's check if the transition from the intermediate states is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, $\\Delta m$ will be in $\\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, which also satisfies the rule.\n        *   Thus, all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate Transition Probabilities**\n    The probability of a specific decay path is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, as the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state has only one allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level (the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state).\n\n    The transition rate $\\Gamma$ from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$. We need to find the relative rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The rate is given by:\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | x | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m' | y | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m' | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\n    Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (since $l=0$), there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the decay rates to the different magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the $l'=1$ state must be equal.\n\n    Let's verify this with the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The rate is proportional to the sum of the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto \\sum_{q=-1,0,1} |\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle|^2$\n    Here, the initial state is $|l,m\\rangle = |0,0\\rangle$ and the final state is $|l',m'\\rangle = |1,m'\\rangle$.\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto \\sum_{q=-1,0,1} |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2$\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is non-zero only if $m+q=m'$, which means $q=m'$. So for each $m'$, only one term in the sum contributes.\n    *   For $m' = 0$: $\\Gamma(0) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,0 | 1,0 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n    *   For $m' = 1$: $\\Gamma(1) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,1 | 1,1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n    *   For $m' = -1$: $\\Gamma(-1) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,-1 | 1,-1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n\n    The rates are indeed equal: $\\Gamma(0) : \\Gamma(1) : \\Gamma(-1) = 1:1:1$.\n\n    The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of these rates: $\\Gamma_{total} \\propto 1+1+1=3$.\n    The probability (branching ratio) of decaying via a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $P(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n*   **Step 3: Final Comparison**\n    The probability for any of the three possible routes is $1/3$. Let's check the options:\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

For an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n\n1.  The orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n2.  The magnetic quantum number, *m*, must change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n\nThe transition from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩ cannot occur directly in a single dipole transition because Δ*l* = 0, which violates the selection rule. Therefore, it must proceed via an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state**\n\n*   **Initial state:** |*n*,*l*,*m*⟩ = |3,0,0⟩\n*   Applying the selection rule Δ*l* = ±1, the intermediate state must have *l*' = 1.\n*   Applying the selection rule Δ*m* = 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have *m*' = 0, 1, or -1.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease. The logical intermediate step is to *n*' = 2.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩**\n\nLet's check if a transition from these intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ is allowed:\n\n*   **Intermediate states:** |2,1,*m*'⟩\n*   **Final state:** |1,0,0⟩\n*   The change in *l* is Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n*   The change in *m* from any of the *m*' = {0, 1, -1} to *m*'' = 0 is also allowed (Δ*m* = 0, -1, or 1).\n\nTherefore, all three decay routes are possible:\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Probability**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio of the first decay step. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. Because there is no preferred direction in space, the probability of transitioning to any of the three magnetic sublevels (*m*' = -1, 0, 1) of the |2,1⟩ state is equal.\n\nSince there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, the probability for any single channel is 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) The path is correct, but the probability is 2/3.

The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **Change in $l$:** The intermediate state has $l'=1$. To reach the final state with $l=0$, the change must be $\\Delta l = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n*   **Change in $m$:** The final state has $m=0$. This is an allowed transition from any of the possible intermediate states:\n    *   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0$.\n    *   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = -1$.\n    *   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = +1$.\n\nAll three pathways are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route is determined by the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **First step branching ratio:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The probability, or branching ratio, for transitioning to any one of these specific states is therefore $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Second step branching ratio:** From any of the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible electric dipole transition to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the branching ratio for this step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any single, complete cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of its individual steps. For the route passing through $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n\n$P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n$P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThis same probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ applies to the other two possible routes as well.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) Path is possible, but probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect).\n*   B) Path is possible, but probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect).\n*   C) Path is possible, but probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect).\n*   D) The path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible and the calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state via dipole transitions is governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.\n\n**1.

The transition from any |2,1,m'> state to |1,0,0> is an allowed transition, and it is the only possible dipole transition to the n=1 shell.

It decays via an intermediate state in two sequential steps, emitting two photons.\n*   **Transition Probability/Branching Ratio:** We need to find the probability that the atom will follow a specific decay path out of all possible decay paths. This is known as the branching ratio for that specific path.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions**\n\nFor an electric dipole transition from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n*   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n = n' - n$ can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so $n' < n$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, we must have $l' - 0 = +1$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, we must have $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The principal quantum number must decrease. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$, which is a valid decay.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nWe need to check if a transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n\n*   **Intermediate State $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:** $n'=2, l'=1$.\n*   **Final State $|1,0,0\\rangle$:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed as long as $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** All three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, all three cascade routes are physically possible.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of the Routes**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. The three possible final states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the non-relativistic theory). Due to the symmetry of the initial state and the degeneracy of the final states, the transition probability must be the same for each of the three possible outcomes.\n    Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any specific one of them is:\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    Once the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, we must consider its possible decay channels. According to the dipole selection rules, it can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. Since energy must be released ($n$ must decrease), the only available lower-energy shell is $n=1$. The $n=1$ shell only has an $l=0$ subshell. Therefore, the only possible dipole decay from the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n    Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this transition occurring, given the atom is in the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, is 1.\n    $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n*   **Total Probability of a Route**\n    The total probability for any of the three specific routes is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } m') = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the Options**\n\nLet's examine the given options based on our findings:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

Since the initial *m* is 0, the possible values for *m'* are 0, +1, and -1.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Second transition: |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n\nLet's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ are allowed:\n\n*   From |2,1,0⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - 0 = 0 (allowed).\n*   From |2,1,1⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed).\n*   From |2,1,-1⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - (-1) = +1 (allowed).\n\nAll three decay routes are permitted by the selection rules.\n\nThe probability of the atom taking any one of these specific paths depends on the transition rates. For the initial transition from the spherically symmetric |3,0,0⟩ state, the transition rates to each of the |2,1,m'⟩ states (where m' = -1, 0, 1) are equal. Since there are three possible, equally probable decay channels for the first step, the probability of decaying through any single one of them is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes and their probabilities are:\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - This is a valid route with the correct probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - The probability is incorrect.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability is incorrect.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability is incorrect.\n\nThus, option A correctly identifies one of the possible transition routes and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe user has confirmed the output is correct. The code successfully applied the constraints and identified the correct option.\n\n1.  **Selection Rules**: All proposed paths are valid according to the electric dipole selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n2.  **Branching Ratios**: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the transition rates to the different magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the final $l'=1$ state are proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m'\\rangle^2$. For a transition from $l=0$ to $l'=1$, these coefficients are equal for all possible final $m'$ states. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$ states.\n3.  **Probability Calculation**: Since there are three equally likely decay channels from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ manifold, the probability for each is $1/3$. The subsequent decay from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the only allowed dipole transition to a lower energy state, so its probability is 1. The total probability of the cascade is therefore the probability of the first step, which is $1/3$.\n4.  **Conclusion**: The path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of $1/3$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer:** The problem requires us to identify the correct decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state through a two-step dipole process.\n\n1.  **First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n    *   The electric dipole transition selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n    *   Starting from |3,0,0> (l=0, m=0), the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   The options suggest the intermediate principal quantum number is n'=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   From any of the |2,1,m'> states, a transition to |1,0,0> is possible.\n    *   For l=1 to l=0, Δl = -1 (allowed).\n    *   For m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1} to m=0, Δm is ∈ {1, 0, -1} (allowed).\n    *   Since spontaneous emission requires the principal quantum number to decrease, the transition from n=2 to n=1 is the only possible decay path from the |2,1,m'> states. Therefore, the probability of this second step, P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>), is 1 for any of the allowed intermediate states.\n\n3.  **Probability Calculation:**\n    *   The probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element |<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>|².\n    *   According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, for a transition from a state with l=0, the transition probabilities to the different m' sublevels of the final state are equal.\n    *   This means the probabilities for the transitions |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>, |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>, and |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> are identical.\n    *   Since these are the only three possible intermediate states in the n=2, l=1 manifold, they must share the total probability equally. The branching ratio for each is 1/3.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of the specific route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> is the product of the probabilities of each step: P(route) = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n**Skeptic:** The reasoning seems sound, but the existence of option B with a probability of 2/3 for the same path is concerning. It suggests there might be a nuance missed. For transitions between states with l ≠ 0, the probabilities for different Δm transitions are not always equal and can depend on factors like polarization. However, for a transition *from* an l=0 state, the spherical symmetry should guarantee equal probabilities for each final m' state, assuming no external fields and that we are averaging over all emission directions. The calculation of 1/3 seems robust. The 2/3 value might arise from a misunderstanding of the question or a non-standard context. A search to confirm the branching ratios for the 3s → 2p transition in hydrogen is a prudent step to verify the theoretical conclusion.\n\n**Decision:** The theoretical argument strongly supports a 1/3 probability for each of the three possible decay paths. I will proceed with a search to confirm this and rule out any alternative interpretations that could lead to a 2/3 probability.\n\n**Proposer:** My initial analysis concluded that the decay of the |3,0,0> state proceeds with equal probability through the three intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. This is based on the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which states that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state (l=0), the transition probabilities to the different magnetic sublevels (m') of a given l' state are identical. The subsequent decay from any |2,1,m'> state to the |1,0,0> ground state has a probability of 1, as it is the only allowed decay channel. Therefore, the probability for any specific route, such as |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, is the branching ratio of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n**Skeptic:** The theoretical argument is sound, but it's crucial to confirm it, especially since an option with a 2/3 probability exists. The search results should be examined for any information that contradicts this 1/3 probability conclusion.\n\n**Analysis of Search Results:**\n*   The search results confirm the standard dipole selection rules: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n*   They also confirm that for a transition to occur, the matrix element of the dipole operator between the initial and final states must be non-zero.\n*   One source directly addresses the question of symmetry for this exact problem. It confirms that the probability for the electron to take each of the three routes (|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0>, |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, and |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) is 1/3. It explicitly states that this is because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which determine the angular part of the transition probability, are the same for all three |3,0,0>→|2,1,m'> transitions.\n*   Another source, while discussing the 2P→1S transition, notes that the transition rate is independent of the magnetic quantum number m, which is a general result. This supports the conclusion that the decay rates from |3,0,0> to each of the |2,1,m'> states are equal.\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial theoretical analysis is strongly supported by the search results, particularly by a source that directly analyzes the same problem. The probability of the cascade proceeding through any single |2,1,m'> state is 1/3. The path specified in options B and D is |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, and its calculated probability is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Based on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physics of the Transition\n\nThe problem describes a two-step electric dipole transition for a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This process is governed by specific selection rules.\n\n1.  **Selection Rules:** For an electric dipole (E1) transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   For spontaneous emission (decay), the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n2.  **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$ and $m=0$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0,$ or $+1$.\n    *   The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$, which is a valid decay ($n$ decreases from 3 to 2).\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   From any of the intermediate states with $l'=1$, a transition to the final state with $l=0$ gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   From any of the intermediate states with $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, a transition to the final state with $m=0$ gives $\\Delta m \\in \\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, which is also allowed.\n    *   Thus, all three decay paths through the possible intermediate states are physically valid.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n1.  **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, meaning it is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any *one* of them is **1/3**.\n\n2.  **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible E1 transition to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this transition occurring is **1**.\n\n3.  **Total Probability:** The total probability for any single, complete cascade route is the product of the probabilities of its steps:\n    $P_{total} = P_{step 1} \\times P_{step 2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid transition route with the correct probability of 1/3.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is incomplete, and the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that any of the three possible decay paths has a probability of 1/3. Option D is the only choice that correctly identifies a valid path and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The decay must proceed through an intermediate state, which, according to the dipole selection rules, must be a *p* state (*l*=1). The options provided suggest the intermediate state is one of the |2,1,m⟩ (2p) states.\n\n### Analysis of the Transition Route\n\n1.  **First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩**\n    *   The initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩.\n    *   According to the electric dipole selection rules, the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be Δ*l* = ±1. Since the initial state has *l*=0, the intermediate state must have *l'*=1.\n    *   The selection rule for the magnetic quantum number is Δ*m* = 0, ±1. Since the initial state has *m*=0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   Therefore, the allowed intermediate states are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n    *   The final state is |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩.\n    *   For a transition from an intermediate state with *l'*=1, the change is Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δ*m* = 0 - *m'*, must be 0, ±1. This condition is met for all possible intermediate *m'* values (-1, 0, 1).\n    *   Thus, all three proposed pathways are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### Calculation of Probabilities\n\nThe question asks for the probability corresponding to a specific transition route. This refers to the branching ratio for that particular decay channel. The branching ratio is the fraction of decays that proceed through a specific path.\n\nLet's consider an ensemble of hydrogen atoms in the initial |3,0,0⟩ state. The first step of the decay is the transition to one of the three degenerate |2,1,m'⟩ states.\n\n*   The rate of a transition is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element.\n*   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric.\n*   Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to be left in any of the three |2,1,m'⟩ states.\n\nThis means the transition rates from |3,0,0⟩ to each of the |2,1,m'⟩ states are equal:\nΓ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩)\n\nThe total rate of decay from the 3s state to the 2p states is the sum of these individual rates:\nΓ<sub>total</sub> = Γ(→|2,1,1⟩) + Γ(→|2,1,0⟩) + Γ(→|2,1,-1⟩)\n\nThe probability, or branching ratio, for any single path (e.g., through the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩) is the rate for that path divided by the total rate:\nP(route via |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(→|2,1,0⟩) / Γ<sub>total</sub>\n\nSince the three individual rates are equal, let's call them Γ<sub>0</sub>. Then Γ<sub>total</sub> = 3Γ<sub>0</sub>.\nP(route via |2,1,0⟩) = Γ<sub>0</sub> / (3Γ<sub>0</sub>) = 1/3.\n\nThe same logic applies to the other two routes, giving them each a probability of 1/3.\n\nOnce the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, it will decay to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state, as this is the only lower-energy state accessible via a dipole transition. The probability of this second step is 1. Therefore, the probability of the entire cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability for the route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 - Incorrect probability.\nB) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 - Correct route and probability.\nC) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 - Incorrect probability.\nD) ⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 - Incomplete and incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state occurs via the emission of photons. In the non-relativistic theory, the most probable transitions are electric dipole (E1) transitions, which are governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Δl = ±1\n*   Δm = 0, ±1\n\nThe initial state of the hydrogen atom is given as |n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩, and the final state is the ground state |1, 0, 0⟩. The decay is stated to occur via two dipole transitions, which implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n**First Transition: |3, 0, 0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n\nApplying the selection rules to the initial state:\n*   Since l = 0, the change in the orbital quantum number must be Δl = +1. Therefore, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   Since m = 0, the change in the magnetic quantum number can be Δm = 0, ±1. This means the possible values for m' are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nFor a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease (n' < n). Given the options, the intermediate state has n'=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, 0⟩, |2, 1, 1⟩, and |2, 1, -1⟩.\n\n**Second Transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩**\n\nNow, we consider the transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩:\n*   The change in the orbital quantum number is Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = 0 - m', depends on the intermediate state:\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, 0⟩, then Δm = 0, which is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, 1⟩, then Δm = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, -1⟩, then Δm = +1, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three decay routes are permitted by the selection rules:\n1.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n2.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 1⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n3.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, -1⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n\n**Transition Probabilities**\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the initial |3, 0, 0⟩ state, the probabilities of transitioning to any of the |2, 1, m'⟩ states (where m' = -1, 0, 1) are equal. This means that each of the three possible decay paths has an equal probability. Since there are three possible routes, the probability for any single route is 1/3.\n\nThe transition route mentioned in options A and B is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe probability for this specific route is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) suggests a probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$, which is incorrect.\n*   B) suggests a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$, which is correct.\n*   C) and D) suggest a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$ for other valid routes, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct transition route and corresponding probability are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn electric dipole transition in the hydrogen atom is governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n,l,m\\rangle$:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The change in the principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted, i.e., $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The problem specifies that the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n\n**Step 1: First transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $m$:** $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Second transition $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $m$:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n\nAll three possible routes are allowed by the selection rules. Now we must determine the probability for each route.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the probability**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route $|i\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle \\rightarrow |f\\rangle$ is given by the branching ratio of the first transition, $P(|i\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle)$, multiplied by the probability of the second transition, $P(|k\\rangle \\rightarrow |f\\rangle)$.\n\nFor the second transition, the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can only decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition (since there are no other lower energy states with $l=0$ or $l=2$ that it can decay to). Therefore, the probability of the second step is 1 for any of the intermediate states.\n$P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to finding the branching ratios for the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must populate each of the possible final magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) with equal probability.\n\nSince there are three possible final $m'$ states, the probability (branching ratio) for the transition to any one of them is $1/3$.\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nThe total probability for each of the three possible cascade routes is therefore $1/3$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the options**\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.

This means there is an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an atomic transition to be allowed under the E1 approximation, the quantum numbers of the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must satisfy the following rules:\n    *   **Parity change:** The parity of the state must change. This is equivalent to the rule for the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be:\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number, $n$, can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n$ is unrestricted), but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition:** The atom starts in the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $l=0$. So, $l_k - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ cannot be negative, the intermediate state must have $l_k = 1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $m=0$. So, $m_k - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m_k = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   **Applying $n_k < n_i$:** The initial state has $n_i=3$. So, the intermediate state must have $n_k < 3$. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n_k=2$.\n    *   **Possible Intermediate States:** Based on the selection rules and the options, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition:** The atom decays from the intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if this is an allowed transition.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $l_k=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The final state has $m_f=0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m_k$.\n        *   If $m_k = -1$, $\\Delta m = 1$. (Allowed)\n        *   If $m_k = 0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. (Allowed)\n        *   If $m_k = 1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. (Allowed)\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, all the routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities:** The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n    *   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle$):**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. The three possible final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy. Due to the symmetry of the initial state and the interaction, the probability of decaying into any of these three substates is equal.\n        Since there are 3 equally likely outcomes, the probability for any specific one is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of $m_k = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        We need to find the branching ratio for this decay. This is the rate of this specific transition divided by the total decay rate of the state $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$. Let's find all possible decay channels for $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the final state must have $l_f = 0$ or $l_f = 2$.\n        *   The rule $n_f < n_k=2$ means $n_f$ must be 1.\n        *   A state with $n=1$ must have $l=0$ (the 1s state). A state with $l=2$ requires $n \\ge 3$.\n        *   Therefore, the only possible final state for a decay from the $n=2, l=1$ level is the $n=1, l=0$ level.\n        *   This means that once the atom reaches any of the $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states, it is guaranteed to decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. The branching ratio is 1.\n        $P(|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Probability of the Cascade:**\n    The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n    *   For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n        $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.

The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe only option that provides a valid route with the correct probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Process\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the excited state |3,0,0> to the ground state |1,0,0>. This decay happens not in a single step, but via a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole transition. We need to find a valid intermediate state that forms a possible decay path and calculate the probability of the atom taking that specific path.\n\n### 2. Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers |n, l, m>:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or ±1.\n*   **Δn**: The principal quantum number change is not restricted (but must decrease for emission).\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>. The decay path is |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>.\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>**\n*   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   Applying Δl = ±1: Since l=0, the final l' must be 1.\n*   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Since m=0, the final m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n*   Applying Δn: n must decrease. Since it's a two-step process to reach n=1, the intermediate state must have n' < 3. The most likely transition is to the nearest available level, which is n'=2. So, n'=2.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   |2, 1, 0>\n*   |2, 1, 1>\n*   |2, 1, -1>\n\n**Second transition: |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>**\nLet's check if our possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n*   Final state: n''=1, l''=0, m''=0.\n*   For all three intermediate states (|2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, |2,1,-1>), we have n'=2, l'=1.\n*   Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n*   Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'.\n    *   If m'=0, Δm=0. (Allowed)\n    *   If m'=1, Δm=-1. (Allowed)\n    *   If m'=-1, Δm=+1. (Allowed)\n\nSo, all three paths are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability of the Transition Route\nThe probability of a specific cascade (a sequence of decays) is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\nP(route) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2)\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 2: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\nThe branching ratio is the probability of a specific decay channel compared to all possible decay channels. A state |2,1,m'> (a 2p state) can only decay to a lower energy level. The only lower energy level is n=1. For n=1, the only possible value for l is l=0. Thus, the only possible final state via a single-photon dipole transition is |1,0,0>. Since this is the only possible decay route, its branching ratio is 1.\n*   BR(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\nThe branching ratio for the decay into a specific state |2,1,m'> is the ratio of the rate of that specific transition to the total decay rate of the initial state |3,0,0>.\n*   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) / Rate_total(|3,0,0>)\n\nThe dominant decay channel for the |3,0,0> (3s) state is to the |2,1,m'> (2p) states. Other decays, like the two-photon decay to 1s, are much slower and can be neglected.\n*   Rate_total(|3,0,0>) ≈ Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) + Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) + Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>)\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element. A key physical principle is that an initial state with l=0 (an s-state) is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space. Therefore, when it decays by emitting a photon, the emission must be isotropic on average, meaning it has no preference for which m' sublevel to populate. This implies that the transition rates to each of the possible final m' states must be equal.\n*   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>)\n\nLet's call this rate `R`. Then the total rate is `R + R + R = 3R`.\nThe branching ratio for the decay to any specific m' state is:\n*   BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = R / (3R) = 1/3\n\nThis can be formally verified using the Wigner-Eckart theorem and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which show that the angular part of the transition matrix element has the same magnitude for all three final m' states when the initial state has l=0.\n\n**Total Probability for each Route**\nNow we can calculate the total probability for each of the three possible routes:\n*   P(route via m'=0) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n*   P(route via m'=1) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n*   P(route via m'=-1) = BR(step 1) × BR(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be 1/3).\n*   B) |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> and 1/4. (The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be 1/3).\n*   C) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 1/3.

(The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect).\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires us to determine a valid decay path for a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two electric dipole (E1) transitions, and to calculate the probability of that specific path.\n\n**1. Plan**\n*   First, I will establish the selection rules for electric dipole transitions.\n*   Next, I will apply these rules to identify the possible intermediate states that connect the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Then, I will calculate the relative probabilities (branching ratios) for the decay from the initial state to each of the possible intermediate states.\n*   Finally, I will determine the probability of the entire two-step process for each path and compare it with the given options.\n\n**2. Execution**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify Selection Rules and Intermediate States**\n    The selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ must change ($\\Delta n \\neq 0$).\n\n    The decay process is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n        *   For a decay cascade, the energy must decrease at each step, so $1 \\le n' < 3$. The intermediate state must be able to decay to $n=1$, so $n' > 1$. This leaves $n'=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Final state: $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Let's check if the transition from the intermediate states is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, $\\Delta m$ will be in $\\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, which also satisfies the rule.\n        *   Thus, all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate Transition Probabilities**\n    The probability of a specific decay path is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, as the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state has only one allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level (the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state).\n\n    The transition rate $\\Gamma$ from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$. We need to find the relative rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The rate is given by:\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | x | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m' | y | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m' | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\n    Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (since $l=0$), there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the decay rates to the different magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the $l'=1$ state must be equal.\n\n    Let's verify this with the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The rate is proportional to the sum of the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto \\sum_{q=-1,0,1} |\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle|^2$\n    Here, the initial state is $|l,m\\rangle = |0,0\\rangle$ and the final state is $|l',m'\\rangle = |1,m'\\rangle$.\n    $\\Gamma(m') \\propto \\sum_{q=-1,0,1} |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2$\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is non-zero only if $m+q=m'$, which means $q=m'$. So for each $m'$, only one term in the sum contributes.\n    *   For $m' = 0$: $\\Gamma(0) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,0 | 1,0 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n    *   For $m' = 1$: $\\Gamma(1) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,1 | 1,1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n    *   For $m' = -1$: $\\Gamma(-1) \\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,-1 | 1,-1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$\n\n    The rates are indeed equal: $\\Gamma(0) : \\Gamma(1) : \\Gamma(-1) = 1:1:1$.\n\n    The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of these rates: $\\Gamma_{total} \\propto 1+1+1=3$.\n    The probability (branching ratio) of decaying via a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $P(m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(m')}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n*   **Step 3: Final Comparison**\n    The probability for any of the three possible routes is $1/3$.

For an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n\n1.  The orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n2.  The magnetic quantum number, *m*, must change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n\nThe transition from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩ cannot occur directly in a single dipole transition because Δ*l* = 0, which violates the selection rule.

Calculate the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route is determined by the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **First step branching ratio:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The probability, or branching ratio, for transitioning to any one of these specific states is therefore $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Second step branching ratio:** From any of the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only possible electric dipole transition to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the branching ratio for this step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any single, complete cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of its individual steps. For the route passing through $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n\n$P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n$P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThis same probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ applies to the other two possible routes as well.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) Path is possible, but probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect).\n*   B) Path is possible, but probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect).\n*   C) Path is possible, but probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect).\n*   D) The path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible and the calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state via dipole transitions is governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.\n\n**1. Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions:**\nThe allowed transitions must satisfy the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0 or ±1.\n*   There is no selection rule for the principal quantum number, n, but for spontaneous emission, the energy of the atom must decrease, so the final n must be less than the initial n.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Decay Path:**\nThe atom starts in the state |3,0,0> and decays to |1,0,0> in two steps. Let the intermediate state be |n',l',m'>.\n\n*   **First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n    *   Initial state: n=3, l=0, m=0.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   Δl = l' - 0 = ±1. Since l must be non-negative, we must have l' = 1.\n        *   Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   n' < 3. The problem implies a cascade through the n=2 state, so we consider n'=2.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n*   **Second Transition: |n',l',m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   Final state: n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0.\n    *   Let's check if a transition from the possible intermediate states (|2,1,m'>) to the final state is allowed:\n        *   Δl = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the selection rule.\n        *   For the intermediate state |2,1,-1>: Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - (-1) = +1. This is allowed.\n        *   For the intermediate state |2,1,0>: Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - 0 = 0. This is allowed.\n        *   For the intermediate state |2,1,1>: Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n    *   Thus, all three pathways are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n**3. Calculating the Transition Probability:**\nThe initial state |3,0,0> is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of the atom emitting a photon and transitioning to any of the three possible m' sublevels of the l'=1 state is equal.\n\nThe total probability of transitioning from |3,0,0> to the |2,1> manifold is the sum of the probabilities to each of the m' states. Since these probabilities are equal, the probability for any one specific path is 1/3.\n\n*   Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n*   Probability(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\nOnce the atom is in one of the intermediate |2,1,m'> states, it must decay to the |1,0,0> state to complete the two-step transition to the ground state. The transition from any |2,1,m'> state to |1,0,0> is an allowed transition, and it is the only possible dipole transition to the n=1 shell. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1, conditioned on the first step having occurred.\n\nThe overall probability of a specific decay route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\n*   The probability for the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0> is 1/3.\n*   The probability for the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> is 1/3.\n*   The probability for the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> is 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{1}{4} (Incorrect probability)\nB) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{1}{3} (Correct route and probability)\nC) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{1}{4} (Incorrect probability)\nD) >→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and \\frac{2}{3} (Malformed and incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Hydrogen Atom States:** The states are described by the quantum numbers $|n, l, m\\rangle$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number, $l$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n*   **Dipole Transition:** This refers to an electric dipole (E1) transition, which is the most common type of radiative transition in atoms. It is governed by specific selection rules.\n*   **Two-Step Decay (Cascade):** The atom does not go from the initial state to the final state directly. It decays via an intermediate state in two sequential steps, emitting two photons.\n*   **Transition Probability/Branching Ratio:** We need to find the probability that the atom will follow a specific decay path out of all possible decay paths. This is known as the branching ratio for that specific path.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions**\n\nFor an electric dipole transition from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n*   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n = n' - n$ can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so $n' < n$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, we must have $l' - 0 = +1$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, we must have $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The principal quantum number must decrease. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$, which is a valid decay.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nWe need to check if a transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n\n*   **Intermediate State $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:** $n'=2, l'=1$.\n*   **Final State $|1,0,0\\rangle$:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed as long as $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** All three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, all three cascade routes are physically possible.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of the Routes**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. The three possible final states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the non-relativistic theory). Due to the symmetry of the initial state and the degeneracy of the final states, the transition probability must be the same for each of the three possible outcomes.\n    Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any specific one of them is:\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    Once the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, we must consider its possible decay channels. According to the dipole selection rules, it can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. Since energy must be released ($n$ must decrease), the only available lower-energy shell is $n=1$. The $n=1$ shell only has an $l=0$ subshell. Therefore, the only possible dipole decay from the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n    Since this is the only possible decay channel, the probability of this transition occurring, given the atom is in the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, is 1.\n    $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n*   **Total Probability of a Route**\n    The total probability for any of the three specific routes is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } m') = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the Options**\n\nLet's examine the given options based on our findings:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect. It should be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe correct option is the one that describes a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability. Our analysis shows that the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid and has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state via electric dipole transitions is governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m*.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Δ*l* = ±1\n*   Δ*m* = 0, ±1\n\nThe initial state is |*n*,*l*,*m*⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ and the final state is |1,0,0⟩. The decay must proceed through an intermediate state, which we can denote as |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩. Since the energy must decrease at each step, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩**\n\n*   According to the selection rule Δ*l* = ±1, since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   The principal quantum number must decrease, so *n'* must be less than 3. A transition to *n'*=2 is possible.\n*   The selection rule for the magnetic quantum number *m* is Δ*m* = 0, ±1. Since the initial *m* is 0, the possible values for *m'* are 0, +1, and -1.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Second transition: |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n\nLet's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ are allowed:\n\n*   From |2,1,0⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - 0 = 0 (allowed).\n*   From |2,1,1⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed).\n*   From |2,1,-1⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - (-1) = +1 (allowed).\n\nAll three decay routes are permitted by the selection rules.\n\nThe probability of the atom taking any one of these specific paths depends on the transition rates. For the initial transition from the spherically symmetric |3,0,0⟩ state, the transition rates to each of the |2,1,m'⟩ states (where m' = -1, 0, 1) are equal. Since there are three possible, equally probable decay channels for the first step, the probability of decaying through any single one of them is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes and their probabilities are:\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - This is a valid route with the correct probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - The probability is incorrect.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability is incorrect.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability is incorrect.\n\nThus, option A correctly identifies one of the possible transition routes and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe user has confirmed the output is correct. The code successfully applied the constraints and identified the correct option.\n\n1.  **Selection Rules**: All proposed paths are valid according to the electric dipole selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n2.  **Branching Ratios**: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the transition rates to the different magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the final $l'=1$ state are proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m'\\rangle^2$. For a transition from $l=0$ to $l'=1$, these coefficients are equal for all possible final $m'$ states. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$ states.\n3.  **Probability Calculation**: Since there are three equally likely decay channels from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ manifold, the probability for each is $1/3$. The subsequent decay from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the only allowed dipole transition to a lower energy state, so its probability is 1. The total probability of the cascade is therefore the probability of the first step, which is $1/3$.\n4.  **Conclusion**: The path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of $1/3$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer:** The problem requires us to identify the correct decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state through a two-step dipole process.\n\n1.  **First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>**\n    *   The electric dipole transition selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n    *   Starting from |3,0,0> (l=0, m=0), the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   The options suggest the intermediate principal quantum number is n'=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   From any of the |2,1,m'> states, a transition to |1,0,0> is possible.\n    *   For l=1 to l=0, Δl = -1 (allowed).\n    *   For m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1} to m=0, Δm is ∈ {1, 0, -1} (allowed).\n    *   Since spontaneous emission requires the principal quantum number to decrease, the transition from n=2 to n=1 is the only possible decay path from the |2,1,m'> states. Therefore, the probability of this second step, P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>), is 1 for any of the allowed intermediate states.\n\n3.  **Probability Calculation:**\n    *   The probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element |<n',l',m'| **r** |n,l,m>|².\n    *   According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, for a transition from a state with l=0, the transition probabilities to the different m' sublevels of the final state are equal.\n    *   This means the probabilities for the transitions |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>, |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>, and |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> are identical.\n    *   Since these are the only three possible intermediate states in the n=2, l=1 manifold, they must share the total probability equally. The branching ratio for each is 1/3.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of the specific route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> is the product of the probabilities of each step: P(route) = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n**Skeptic:** The reasoning seems sound, but the existence of option B with a probability of 2/3 for the same path is concerning. It suggests there might be a nuance missed. For transitions between states with l ≠ 0, the probabilities for different Δm transitions are not always equal and can depend on factors like polarization. However, for a transition *from* an l=0 state, the spherical symmetry should guarantee equal probabilities for each final m' state, assuming no external fields and that we are averaging over all emission directions. The calculation of 1/3 seems robust. The 2/3 value might arise from a misunderstanding of the question or a non-standard context. A search to confirm the branching ratios for the 3s → 2p transition in hydrogen is a prudent step to verify the theoretical conclusion.\n\n**Decision:** The theoretical argument strongly supports a 1/3 probability for each of the three possible decay paths. I will proceed with a search to confirm this and rule out any alternative interpretations that could lead to a 2/3 probability.\n\n**Proposer:** My initial analysis concluded that the decay of the |3,0,0> state proceeds with equal probability through the three intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. This is based on the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which states that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state (l=0), the transition probabilities to the different magnetic sublevels (m') of a given l' state are identical. The subsequent decay from any |2,1,m'> state to the |1,0,0> ground state has a probability of 1, as it is the only allowed decay channel. Therefore, the probability for any specific route, such as |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, is the branching ratio of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n**Skeptic:** The theoretical argument is sound, but it's crucial to confirm it, especially since an option with a 2/3 probability exists. The search results should be examined for any information that contradicts this 1/3 probability conclusion.\n\n**Analysis of Search Results:**\n*   The search results confirm the standard dipole selection rules: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\n*   They also confirm that for a transition to occur, the matrix element of the dipole operator between the initial and final states must be non-zero.\n*   One source directly addresses the question of symmetry for this exact problem. It confirms that the probability for the electron to take each of the three routes (|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0>, |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, and |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) is 1/3. It explicitly states that this is because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which determine the angular part of the transition probability, are the same for all three |3,0,0>→|2,1,m'> transitions.\n*   Another source, while discussing the 2P→1S transition, notes that the transition rate is independent of the magnetic quantum number m, which is a general result. This supports the conclusion that the decay rates from |3,0,0> to each of the |2,1,m'> states are equal.\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial theoretical analysis is strongly supported by the search results, particularly by a source that directly analyzes the same problem. The probability of the cascade proceeding through any single |2,1,m'> state is 1/3. The path specified in options B and D is |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>, and its calculated probability is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
