So we need to calculate:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n\n**Step 2: Define the State Vector (ket) and its Conjugate Transpose (bra)**\n\n*   The given spin state is `(3i, 4)`. In column vector (ket) notation, this is:\n    `|χ> = [ 3i ]`\n    `      [ 4  ]`\n*   The corresponding bra vector, `<χ|`, is the conjugate transpose of `|χ>`.\n    1.  Transpose `|χ>`: `[3i, 4]`\n    2.  Take the complex conjugate of each element: `[-3i, 4]`\n    So, `<χ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to forget to take the complex conjugate when forming the bra vector. Remember that `(i)* = -i`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Normalization Factor `<χ|χ>`**\n\nThis is the denominator in our expectation value formula.\n`<χ|χ> = [-3i, 4] * [ 3i ]`\n`                  [ 4  ]`\n`<χ|χ> = (-3i)*(3i) + (4)*(4)`\n`<χ|χ> = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`, we have:\n`<χ|χ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n**Careful Point:** The inner product of a state with itself, `<ψ|ψ>`, must always be a real, non-negative number. Our result of 25 confirms this.\n\n**Step 4: Define the Operator `S_y`**\n\nThe spin operator `S` is related to the Pauli matrices `σ` by `S = (ħ/2)σ`.\nTherefore, `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\nUsing the given `σ_y` matrix:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]`\n`            [ i   0 ]`\n\n**Careful Point:** Do not forget the `ħ/2` factor. The Pauli matrices themselves are dimensionless, but the spin operator has units of angular momentum.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Numerator `<χ|S_y|χ>`**\n\nTo make the calculation easier, we first compute the action of the operator on the ket, `S_y|χ>`.\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]`\n`            [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ (0)*(3i) + (-i)*(4) ]`\n`            [ (i)*(3i) + (0)*(4)  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`            [ 3i² ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`            [ -3  ]`\n\nNow, we multiply this result by the bra `<χ|`:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\nLet's pull the constant `(ħ/2)` to the front:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3) )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( 12i² - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -12 - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -24 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = -12ħ`\n\n**Careful Point:** Be very careful with the matrix multiplication and the arithmetic involving the imaginary unit `i`.\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the Final Answer**\n\nNow we combine the numerator and the denominator to find the expectation value:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n`<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, $\\langle S_y \\rangle$.\n\n**1.

A quantum state is normalized when its inner product with itself equals one. The normalization constant, A, is calculated as follows:\n\n|A|² * [(3i)*(-3i) + 4*4] = 1\n|A|² * [9 + 16] = 1\n|A|² * 25 = 1\nA = 1/5\n\nTherefore, the normalized spin state is:\n|ψ⟩ = (1/5) * (3i, 4)\n\nNext, the spin operator for the y-direction, S_y, is defined as (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma_y matrix.\n\nS_y = (ħ/2) * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n\nThe expectation value ⟨Sy⟩ is then calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩. The term ⟨ψ| represents the conjugate transpose (bra) of the state vector |ψ⟩ (ket).\n\n⟨ψ| = (1/5) * (-3i, 4)\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  First, apply the S_y operator to the state vector |ψ⟩:\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    0 & -i \\\\\n    i & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n     * (1/5) * \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    3i \\\\\n    4\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n     = (ħ/10) * \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -4i \\\\\n    -3\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n\n2.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the expectation value of the spin operator in the y-direction, denoted as `<S_y>`, for an electron in a given spin state. The formula for the expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ>` is:\n`<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\nThis formula is essential because the given state may not be normalized.\n\n**2. Define the State Vector (Ket and Bra)**\nThe spin state is given as a column vector (ket):\n`|χ> =`\n`[ 3i ]`\n`[ 4  ]`\n\nThe corresponding bra vector `<χ|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|χ>`.\n-   Transpose of `|χ>` is `[3i, 4]`.\n-   Complex conjugate of `[3i, 4]` is `[-3i, 4]`.\nSo, the bra vector is:\n`<χ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Normalization Factor `<χ|χ>`**\nThis is the denominator in the expectation value formula.\n`<χ|χ> = [-3i, 4] * [ 3i ]`\n`                  [ 4  ]`\n`<χ|χ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`<χ|χ> = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`:\n`<χ|χ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\nThe state is not normalized, so we must divide by this factor of 25.\n\n**4. Define the Spin Operator `S_y`**\nThe spin operator `S_y` is related to the Pauli matrix `σ_y` by the formula:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\nGiven `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, the operator is:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) *`\n`[ 0  -i ]`\n`[ i   0 ]`\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerator `<χ|S_y|χ>`**\nFirst, we apply the operator `S_y` to the ket `|χ>`:\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]`\n`                 [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ]`\n`                 [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`                 [ 3i² ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`                 [ -3  ]`\n\nNext, we multiply this result by the bra `<χ|`:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\nWe can pull the constant `(ħ/2)` to the front:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( 12i² - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -12 - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -24 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = -12ħ`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Expectation Value `<S_y>`**\nNow, we divide the numerator by the normalization factor:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n`<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis can be written as `-12*hbar/25`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Normalization:** Always check if the state is normalized. If not, you must divide by the inner product `<ψ|ψ>`. Forgetting this is a common error.\n2.  **Bra Vector:** Remember that the bra is the **conjugate** transpose. The complex number `3i` becomes `-3i`.\n3.  **Operator Form:** The spin operator `S_y` includes the factor `ħ/2`. Do not just use the Pauli matrix `σ_y`.\n4.  **Complex Arithmetic:** Be meticulous with calculations involving `i`, especially `i² = -1` and signs during multiplication. For example, `(-3i)(-4i) = +12i² = -12`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe calculated expectation value is `-12ħ/25`, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe expectation value of an operator A for a quantum state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n`<A> = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n\nIn this problem, the operator is the spin along the y-direction, `S_y`, and the state is `|χ⟩`.\nThe operator `S_y` is defined as `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`.\nThe state is given as `|χ⟩ = (3i, 4)`, which in column vector (ket) notation is:\n`|χ⟩ = [[3i], [4]]`\n\nThe corresponding bra vector, `⟨χ|`, is the conjugate transpose of `|χ⟩`:\n`⟨χ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the normalization factor `⟨χ|χ⟩`**\nThis is the inner product of the state with itself.\n`⟨χ|χ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [[3i], [4]]`\n`⟨χ|χ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`, this becomes:\n`⟨χ|χ⟩ = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the numerator `⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩`**\nWe can pull the constant `ħ/2` out of the expectation value calculation:\n`⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = ⟨χ| * (ħ/2) * σ_y * |χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ⟨χ|σ_y|χ⟩`\n\nFirst, let's find the result of `σ_y|χ⟩`:\n`σ_y|χ⟩ = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [[3i], [4]]`\n`σ_y|χ⟩ = [[(0)(3i) + (-i)(4)], [(i)(3i) + (0)(4)]] = [[-4i], [3i²]] = [[-4i], [-3]]`\n\nNow, we multiply this result by the bra `⟨χ|`:\n`⟨χ|σ_y|χ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [[-4i], [-3]]`\n`⟨χ|σ_y|χ⟩ = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i² - 12 = 12(-1) - 12 = -24`\n\nSo, the full numerator is:\n`⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final expectation value `<S_y>`**\n`<S_y> = ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩ / ⟨χ|χ⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25`\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is `-12ħ/25`.

This involves taking the transpose to get a row vector and then taking the complex conjugate of each element.\n    `⟨ψ| = [ (3i)*, 4* ] = [ -3i, 4 ]`\n\n**Careful Point:** A common error is forgetting to take the complex conjugate of the imaginary term `3i` to get `-3i` when forming the bra vector.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Normalization Factor `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**\n\nThis term forms the denominator of our expectation value formula.\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ 3i ]`\n`                     [ 4  ]`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`, this becomes:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n**Careful Point:** The inner product of a state with itself, `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`, must be a non-negative real number. Our result of 25 confirms this. Forgetting to divide by this factor at the end is a frequent mistake when dealing with unnormalized states.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Spin Operator `S_y`**\n\nThe spin operator `S_y` is defined in terms of the reduced Planck constant `ħ` and the Pauli matrix `σ_y`:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\nGiven the matrix for `σ_y`:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]`\n`            [ i   0 ]`\n\n**Careful Point:** The `ħ/2` factor is part of the definition of the spin operator and must be included in the calculation.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Numerator `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩`**\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we first apply the operator `S_y` to the ket `|ψ⟩`:\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]`\n`            [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ]`\n`            [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]`\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`            [ 3i² ]`\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`            [ -3  ]`\n\nNow, we multiply this resulting vector by the bra `⟨ψ|`:\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [ -3i, 4 ] * ( (ħ/2) * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) ]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ 12i² - 12 ]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -12 - 12 ]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( -24 ) = -12ħ`\n\n**Careful Point:** Be meticulous with complex arithmetic. A sign error in the multiplication `(-3i)(-4i) = +12i² = -12` would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Expectation Value**\n\nNow, we divide the numerator from Step 4 by the denominator from Step 2:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis result, `-12*hbar/25`, corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

So we need to calculate:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n\n**Step 2: Define the State Vector (ket) and its Conjugate Transpose (bra)**\n\n*   The given spin state is `(3i, 4)`. In column vector (ket) notation, this is:\n    `|χ> = [ 3i ]`\n    `      [ 4  ]`\n*   The corresponding bra vector, `<χ|`, is the conjugate transpose of `|χ>`.\n    1.  Transpose `|χ>`: `[3i, 4]`\n    2.  Take the complex conjugate of each element: `[-3i, 4]`\n    So, `<χ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to forget to take the complex conjugate when forming the bra vector. Remember that `(i)* = -i`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Normalization Factor `<χ|χ>`**\n\nThis is the denominator in our expectation value formula.\n`<χ|χ> = [-3i, 4] * [ 3i ]`\n`                  [ 4  ]`\n`<χ|χ> = (-3i)*(3i) + (4)*(4)`\n`<χ|χ> = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`, we have:\n`<χ|χ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n**Careful Point:** The inner product of a state with itself, `<ψ|ψ>`, must always be a real, non-negative number. Our result of 25 confirms this.\n\n**Step 4: Define the Operator `S_y`**\n\nThe spin operator `S` is related to the Pauli matrices `σ` by `S = (ħ/2)σ`.\nTherefore, `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\nUsing the given `σ_y` matrix:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]`\n`            [ i   0 ]`\n\n**Careful Point:** Do not forget the `ħ/2` factor. The Pauli matrices themselves are dimensionless, but the spin operator has units of angular momentum.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Numerator `<χ|S_y|χ>`**\n\nTo make the calculation easier, we first compute the action of the operator on the ket, `S_y|χ>`.\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]`\n`            [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ (0)*(3i) + (-i)*(4) ]`\n`            [ (i)*(3i) + (0)*(4)  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`            [ 3i² ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`            [ -3  ]`\n\nNow, we multiply this result by the bra `<χ|`:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\nLet's pull the constant `(ħ/2)` to the front:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3) )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( 12i² - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -12 - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -24 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = -12ħ`\n\n**Careful Point:** Be very careful with the matrix multiplication and the arithmetic involving the imaginary unit `i`.\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the Final Answer**\n\nNow we combine the numerator and the denominator to find the expectation value:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n`<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, $\\langle S_y \\rangle$.\n\n**1.

A quantum state is normalized when its inner product with itself equals one. The normalization constant, A, is calculated as follows:\n\n|A|² * [(3i)*(-3i) + 4*4] = 1\n|A|² * [9 + 16] = 1\n|A|² * 25 = 1\nA = 1/5\n\nTherefore, the normalized spin state is:\n|ψ⟩ = (1/5) * (3i, 4)\n\nNext, the spin operator for the y-direction, S_y, is defined as (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma_y matrix.\n\nS_y = (ħ/2) * \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n\nThe expectation value ⟨Sy⟩ is then calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the expectation value of the spin operator in the y-direction, denoted as `<S_y>`, for an electron in a given spin state. The formula for the expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ>` is:\n`<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\nThis formula is essential because the given state may not be normalized.\n\n**2. Define the State Vector (Ket and Bra)**\nThe spin state is given as a column vector (ket):\n`|χ> =`\n`[ 3i ]`\n`[ 4  ]`\n\nThe corresponding bra vector `<χ|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|χ>`.\n-   Transpose of `|χ>` is `[3i, 4]`.\n-   Complex conjugate of `[3i, 4]` is `[-3i, 4]`.\nSo, the bra vector is:\n`<χ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Normalization Factor `<χ|χ>`**\nThis is the denominator in the expectation value formula.\n`<χ|χ> = [-3i, 4] * [ 3i ]`\n`                  [ 4  ]`\n`<χ|χ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`<χ|χ> = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`:\n`<χ|χ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\nThe state is not normalized, so we must divide by this factor of 25.\n\n**4. Define the Spin Operator `S_y`**\nThe spin operator `S_y` is related to the Pauli matrix `σ_y` by the formula:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\nGiven `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, the operator is:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) *`\n`[ 0  -i ]`\n`[ i   0 ]`\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerator `<χ|S_y|χ>`**\nFirst, we apply the operator `S_y` to the ket `|χ>`:\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]`\n`                 [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ]`\n`                 [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`                 [ 3i² ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`                 [ -3  ]`\n\nNext, we multiply this result by the bra `<χ|`:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\nWe can pull the constant `(ħ/2)` to the front:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( 12i² - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -12 - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -24 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = -12ħ`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Expectation Value `<S_y>`**\nNow, we divide the numerator by the normalization factor:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n`<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis can be written as `-12*hbar/25`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Normalization:** Always check if the state is normalized. If not, you must divide by the inner product `<ψ|ψ>`. Forgetting this is a common error.\n2.  **Bra Vector:** Remember that the bra is the **conjugate** transpose. The complex number `3i` becomes `-3i`.\n3.  **Operator Form:** The spin operator `S_y` includes the factor `ħ/2`. Do not just use the Pauli matrix `σ_y`.\n4.  **Complex Arithmetic:** Be meticulous with calculations involving `i`, especially `i² = -1` and signs during multiplication.

In column vector notation, this is:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]`\n    The conjugate transpose, `⟨ψ|`, is a row vector where each element is the complex conjugate of the original:\n    `⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n2.  **Calculate the normalization factor `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4] = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n3.  **Define the `S_y` operator:**\n    The spin operator in the y-direction is `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n4.  **Calculate `S_y|ψ⟩`:**\n    `S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [ -4i, 3i² ]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the numerator `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) ]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [ 12i² - 12 ]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [ -12 - 12 ]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [-24]`\n    `= -12ħ`\n\n6.  **Calculate the final expectation value `⟨S_y⟩`:**\n    `⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThe result `-12ħ/25` can be written as `-12*hbar/25`. This matches option D.
