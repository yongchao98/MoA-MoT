    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle $X^0$ has a total energy (27 GeV) much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), which means it's traveling at a relativistic speed. This leads to two important effects:\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n    *   **Relativistic Velocity:** The particle travels at a velocity $v$ very close to the speed of light, $c$.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential probability law. The number of particles remaining after a certain distance or time decreases exponentially.\n\n**2. Define the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\" needed to \"observe at least 30% of the decays.\"\n*   **Resolution ($x_{min}$):** This is the minimum distance the particle $X^0$ must travel from its creation point for its track to be distinguished from the decay products' tracks. If the particle decays at a distance shorter than $x_{min}$, the decay is considered \"unobserved.\"\n*   **Observing at least 30% of decays:** This means that the probability of a particle traveling a distance greater than or equal to the resolution $x_{min}$ before it decays must be at least 30% (or 0.3).\n\n**3. Formulate the Mathematical Steps**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the total energy ($E$) to the rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n    Given $E = 27$ GeV and $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame ($L_{avg}$)**\n    This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It's the product of the particle's lab-frame velocity ($v = \\beta c$) and its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$).\n    $L_{avg} = v \\cdot \\tau = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$\n    A more direct formula uses the particle's momentum ($p$):\n    $L_{avg} = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$\n    Since $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$, we have $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n    So, $L_{avg} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$.\n\n*   **Step C: Set up the Probability Condition**\n    The probability of a particle surviving to travel a distance $x$ is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/L_{avg}}$. This is also the probability that the decay will happen at a distance greater than $x$. We want this probability to be at least 0.3 for the resolution distance $x_{min}$.\n    $P(x \\ge x_{min}) = e^{-x_{min}/L_{avg}} \\ge 0.3$\n\n*   **Step D: Solve for the Minimum Resolution ($x_{min}$)**\n    To find the minimum resolution, we use the equality:\n    $e^{-x_{min}/L_{avg}} = 0.3$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{x_{min}}{L_{avg}} = \\ln(0.3)$\n    $x_{min} = -L_{avg} \\cdot \\ln(0.3) = L_{avg} \\cdot \\ln(\\frac{1}{0.3})$\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nWe will use a Python script to perform the calculation with high precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the constants provided in the problem\ntau0 = 8e-16  # proper lifetime in seconds\nE = 27.0      # Total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41     # Rest mass energy in GeV\nc = 299792458 # speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step B: Calculate the mean decay length (L_avg)\n# We use the formula L_avg = (sqrt(E^2 - m0^2) / m0) * c * tau0\n# The ratio of energies is dimensionless.\nfactor = np.sqrt(E**2 - m0**2) / m0\nL_avg = factor * c * tau0\n\n# Step D: Solve for the minimum resolution (x_min)\n# x_min = L_avg * ln(1 / 0.3)\nx_min = L_avg * np.log(1 / 0.30)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to compare with the options\nprint(f\"{x_min:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.268e-06\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation yields a minimum resolution of $x_{min} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is of the same order of magnitude as option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. The small discrepancy (about 9%) between the calculated value and option C is likely due to a minor typo in the numerical values provided in the problem statement.

    "This problem requires us to combine principles of special relativity (time dilation) with the physics of exponential decay to determine the minimum spatial resolution needed to observe a certain fraction of particle decays.\n\n**1. Understanding the Physics**\n\n*   **Relativistic Motion:** The particle $X^0$ has a total energy $E = 27$ GeV, which is significantly larger than its rest mass energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV. This means it is moving at a speed very close to the speed of light ($v \\approx c$). Due to this high speed, we must account for relativistic effects.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the bubble chamber), the particle's lifetime appears longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). The lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will survive to travel a distance $x$ before decaying is described by an exponential law: $P(x) = e^{-x/L_{avg}}$, where $L_{avg}$ is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's minimum resolution, which we'll call $x_{min}$. The problem states we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the probability of the particle traveling a distance $x \\ge x_{min}$ must be at least 0.30.\n\n**2. Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the mean decay length ($L_{avg}$) in the lab frame.**\n    The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It is given by $L_{avg} = v \\cdot \\tau = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    We can express the term $\\gamma \\beta$ using the particle's energy and mass:\n    $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$ and the relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m_0v = \\gamma m_0 \\beta c$.\n    The energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    From this, we find $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n    So, $p = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{c}$.\n    The mean decay length can also be written as $L_{avg} = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0$. Substituting for $p$:\n    $L_{avg} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n    We can now plug in the given values:\n    $E = 27$ GeV\n    $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n*   **Step 2: Set up the probability equation.**\n    The probability of observing the decay is the probability that the particle travels a distance $x \\ge x_{min}$. This is the same as the probability of the particle surviving up to the distance $x_{min}$.\n    $P(x \\ge x_{min}) = e^{-x_{min}/L_{avg}}$\n    We are given that this probability must be at least 30%, so we set the lower bound:\n    $e^{-x_{min}/L_{avg}} = 0.30$\n\n*   **Step 3: Solve for the minimum resolution ($x_{min}$).**\n    To solve for $x_{min}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{x_{min}}{L_{avg}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $x_{min} = -L_{avg} \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = L_{avg} \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.30}\\right)$\n\n**3.

    "This problem combines concepts from special relativity and the statistics of particle decay. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculation.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a particle $X^0$ created with a high total energy ($E$) in a bubble chamber. It has a known rest mass ($m_0$) and a proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). We need to find the minimum spatial resolution ($x_{min}$) of the detector required to observe at least 30% of its decays.\n\n*   **Observation:** Observing a decay means the particle $X^0$ must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($x > x_{min}$) before it decays. If it decays at a distance shorter than $x_{min}$, the creation and decay points are indistinguishable.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** Since the particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), it is traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light.

The formula for the mean decay length is:\n    $L_{avg} = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$\n    where $p$ is the relativistic momentum. We find the momentum term $pc$ from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    So, $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n    Substituting this back, we get:\n    $L_{avg} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\n*   **Step B: Use the Exponential Decay Law to Find the Resolution**\n    The probability that a particle will survive to travel a distance $x$ before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/L_{avg}}$.\n    We want to observe at least 30% of the decays, which means we require the particle to travel a distance $x \\ge x_{min}$ with a probability of at least 0.3.\n    $P(x \\ge x_{min}) = e^{-x_{min}/L_{avg}} \\ge 0.30$\n    To find the minimum resolution, we solve the equality:\n    $e^{-x_{min}/L_{avg}} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{x_{min}}{L_{avg}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $x_{min} = -L_{avg} \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = L_{avg} \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.30}\\right)$\n\n**3.

    "The calculation has been performed, and the result is consistent. Here is a detailed explanation of the steps to reach the solution.\n\n**Summary of the Method**\n\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle, so its lifetime in the laboratory frame is longer than its proper lifetime (time dilation). The particle travels a certain distance before decaying, and this decay process follows an exponential probability law. We need to find the minimum distance ($x_{min}$) such that the probability of the particle traveling at least this far is 30%.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L_{avg}$)**\n\nThe mean decay length is the average distance a particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. The formula relates the particle's momentum ($p$), rest mass ($m_0$), speed of light ($c$), and proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n\n$L_{avg} = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\nWe first need to find the relativistic momentum term, $pc$, using the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\nGiven:\n*   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation:\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{729 - 11.63} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\nNow, we calculate $L_{avg}$:\n$L_{avg} = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.88 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($x_{min}$)**\n\nThe probability that a particle survives to travel a distance $x$ is given by the exponential decay law: $P(x) = e^{-x/L_{avg}}$.\n\nWe want to observe at least 30% of the decays, which means the particle must travel a distance $x \\ge x_{min}$ with a probability of at least 0.3. We solve for the boundary condition:\n\n$P(x \\ge x_{min}) = e^{-x_{min}/L_{avg}} = 0.30$\n\nTo solve for $x_{min}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n$-\\frac{x_{min}}{L_{avg}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n\n$x_{min} = -L_{avg} \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = L_{avg} \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.30}\\right) \\approx L_{avg} \\cdot (1.204)$\n\nUsing the value of $L_{avg}$ from Step 1:\n\n$x_{min} \\approx (1.88 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 1.204 \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation, confirmed by the Python script output `2.268e-06`, gives the minimum required resolution as approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\nOur calculated value is of the same order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) as option C and is numerically very close. The minor difference between the calculated $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m and the offered $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is likely due to slight inconsistencies in the problem's provided numerical values. Given the choices, option C is unequivocally the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
