    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compounds and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n1.  **Analyze the simplest reaction first: D + B -> H**\n    *   This reaction describes the formation of a solvent (H) from two gases (D and B) in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   A very common and highly reactive inorganic solvent is chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃).\n    *   The synthesis of ClF₃ can be achieved by reacting chlorine monofluoride (ClF) with fluorine (F₂): ClF(g) + F₂(g) -> ClF₃(l).\n    *   This reaction fits the 1:1 stoichiometry.\n    *   Let's hypothesize:\n        *   **B = ClF** (Chlorine monofluoride, gas)\n        *   **D = F₂** (Fluorine, gas)\n        *   **H = ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride, a liquid solvent)\n\n2.  **Analyze the acids F and G**\n    *   The problem states that hydrolysis of C produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G).\n    *   If B is ClF, its components are chlorine and fluorine. Hydrolysis of metal/non-metal chlorides typically yields hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid. Hydrolysis of metal/non-metal fluorides yields hydrofluoric acid (HF), which is a weak acid.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description. So we can identify:\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, strong)\n        *   **G = HF** (Hydrofluoric acid, weak)\n\n3.  **Analyze the reaction C + 2D -> E**\n    *   Substituting our identified compound D: C + 2F₂ -> E.\n    *   This means E is a product of the fluorination of C. E is described as \"extremely hazardous\". Most fluorine compounds are hazardous.\n\n4.  **Analyze the cycle: A -> C -> A**\n    *   Reaction 1: A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red) => A(s) + 8ClF(g) -> C(bright red)\n    *   Reaction 3: C + H₂O -> A + F + G => C + H₂O -> A + HCl + HF\n    *   The fact that solid A is reformed upon hydrolysis of C is a major clue. This suggests that the formation of C from A is reversible by water.\n    *   Let's consider the hydrolysis reaction. For the atoms to balance, an oxygen-containing product is likely formed. For A to be reformed in its elemental or original state, the hydrolysis is likely a redox reaction where A is reduced from its state in C, and water is oxidized.\n    *   `C + water -> A + HCl + HF + O₂`\n\n5.  **Identify A, C, and E**\n    *   This set of reactions is a classic, albeit difficult, chemical puzzle. The key lies in identifying a system that fits all these specific and unusual constraints. The chemistry of the noble gases is a frequent source for such puzzles.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the chemistry is centered around Xenon (Xe).\n    *   Consider the reaction: **Xe + 2F₂ -> XeF₄**.\n    *   This reaction has a 1:2 stoichiometry, which perfectly matches our `C + 2D -> E` reaction if we set **C = Xe** and **E = XeF₄**.\n    *   Let's evaluate this fit:\n        *   **E = XeF₄** (Xenon tetrafluoride). Is it extremely hazardous? Yes, it is a powerful fluorinating agent and reacts violently with water.\n        *   **D = F₂**, which we already deduced.\n        *   **C = Xe** (Xenon).\n\n6.  **Resolve the contradictions with C = Xe**\n    *   **Contradiction 1**: \"bright red product C\". Xenon is a colorless gas. However, in the context of a chemical reaction producing it, C could refer to the \"product\" as a whole system, such as a Xenon plasma discharge, which can have a reddish-purple glow. This is a stretch, but a possible interpretation in a puzzle.\n    *   **Contradiction 2**: \"C reacts with water to reform A...\". Xenon does not react with water. This is the most significant obstacle. However, it's possible the problem is flawed or implies a very unusual set of conditions. Given how well `Xe + 2F₂ -> XeF₄` fits the `C + 2D -> E` step, it's worth seeing if there's any way around this. If we cannot resolve this, we must reconsider.\n\n7.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n    *   Let's assume, despite the contradictions, that the puzzle is constructed around E = XeF₄ because the `C+2D->E` part fits so well. We need to find the point group of XeF₄.\n    *   According to VSEPR theory, XeF₄ has a central xenon atom bonded to four fluorine atoms, with two lone pairs on the xenon.\n    *   The six electron pairs arrange octahedrally. To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy opposite (axial) positions.\n    *   This leaves the four fluorine atoms in the same plane as the xenon atom, at the corners of a square.\n    *   The molecular geometry is **square planar**.\n    *   Now, let's determine the symmetry point group for a square planar AB₄ molecule.\n        *   It has a principal C₄ axis perpendicular to the plane.\n        *   It has four C₂ axes in the plane (two passing through opposite F atoms, and two bisecting the F-Xe-F angles).\n        *   It has a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   It has vertical mirror planes (σv) and dihedral mirror planes (σd).\n        *   It has an inversion center (i).\n    *   A molecule with a Cₙ axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) belongs to the Dnh point group. Since n=4, the point group is **D₄h**.\n\n8.  **Conclusion**\n    The chain of deduction strongly points to E being XeF₄, which has a square planar structure and belongs to the D₄h point group. While there are inconsistencies in the problem description when trying to identify all compounds, the fit between the properties of E (hazardous, formed from C+2F₂) and the known molecule XeF₄ (D₄h symmetry) is the most compelling piece of evidence.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (XeF₄) is D₄h.\n\n<<<C>>>"
