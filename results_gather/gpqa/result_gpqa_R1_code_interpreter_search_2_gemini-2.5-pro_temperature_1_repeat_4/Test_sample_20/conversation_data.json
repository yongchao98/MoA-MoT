    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Definition of Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in dynamic equilibrium and can be readily interconverted. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, there must be a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n\n    *   **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n        *   Let's identify the alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=O groups). The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are alpha to a carbonyl group.\n        *   However, these alpha-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds within the ring. They are sp2 hybridized and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, p-benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. The molecule is a stable, conjugated system as it is.\n\n    *   **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   The structure is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons. Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH2 group, meaning each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   These alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because if one is removed, the resulting negative charge (enolate ion) is stabilized by resonance with two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the molecule to readily undergo tautomerization. It exists in equilibrium with its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol).\n        *   The enol form (phloroglucinol) is an aromatic compound, which makes it exceptionally stable. Therefore, the equilibrium strongly favors the enol form.\n        *   Conclusion: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exhibits significant tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does *not* show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Definition of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon atom is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (exist as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the trans isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   Let's check for chiral centers. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the C=C double bond are sp2 hybridized.\n        *   Let's check for overall molecular symmetry. The molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry in the middle of the C=C bond). If a molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n        *   Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Final Combination:**\n    *   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   (B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to the option: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
