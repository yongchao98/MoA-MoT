    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Count the Bonds**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of atoms and the different types of bonds.\nThe chemical name given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbon (C): Let's count the carbon atoms.\n        *   (CH3)2C-: 1 (in chain) + 2 (in methyl groups) = 3\n        *   =CH-: 1\n        *   -CH2-: 1\n        *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 (in chain) + 1 (in methyl group) = 2\n        *   -CH2-: 1\n        *   -CH=C(CH3)2: 1 (in chain) + 2 (in methyl groups) = 3\n        *   Total C atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 12 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogen (H): Let's count the hydrogen atoms.\n        *   (CH3)2C-: 2 * 3 = 6\n        *   =CH-: 1\n        *   -CH2-: 2\n        *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 (on chain) + 3 (in methyl group) = 4\n        *   -CH2-: 2\n        *   -CH=C(CH3)2: 1 (on CH) + 2 * 3 = 7. Let's re-read the formula carefully: `-CH=C(CH3)2`. The H is on the carbon before the last one. The last carbon has two methyl groups and no H. So, it's `-CH=` which has 1H, and `=C(CH3)2` has 6H.\n        *   Let's recount H atoms: 6 (from first part) + 1 (from =CH-) + 2 (from -CH2-) + 4 (from -CH(CH3)-) + 2 (from -CH2-) + 1 (from -CH=) + 6 (from =C(CH3)2) = 22 hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds (`=`), so there are 2 C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We can count them from the structure, or use a formula for non-cyclic alkanes/alkenes. The total number of bonds between the 12 carbon atoms is 12 - 1 = 11. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining bonds must be single bonds. So, the number of C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = 9.\n    *   Let's verify by counting from the structure:\n        *   2 bonds connecting the first C to two CH3 groups.\n        *   1 bond between C=C-C.\n        *   1 bond between C-C-C.\n        *   1 bond connecting the chain C to a CH3 group.\n        *   1 bond between C-C-C.\n        *   1 bond between C-C=C.\n        *   2 bonds connecting the last C to two CH3 groups.\n        *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9. The count is correct.\n\n**Summary of Counts:**\n*   C-H bonds: 22\n*   C-C bonds: 9\n*   C=C bonds: 2\n*   Carbon atoms: 12\n*   Hydrogen atoms: 22 (meaning 11 H2 molecules)\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Molecule (ΔH_atomization)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms.\nΔH_atomization = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\n\nUsing the given bond energies (BE):\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atomization = 1800 + 600 + 8800\nΔH_atomization = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy to Form Gaseous Atoms from Standard States**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the constituent elements in their standard states (solid carbon, gaseous hydrogen) into individual gaseous atoms.\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nThe atomization of reactants is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\nThe enthalpy change for this process (let's call it ΔH_reactants_atomized) is:\nΔH_reactants_atomized = (12 × ΔH_atomization(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n\nUsing the given data:\n*   ΔH_atomization(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_reactants_atomized = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_reactants_atomized = 12000 + 1100\nΔH_reactants_atomized = 13100 kJ/mol\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation can be found using Hess's Law:\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of products)\nΔH_f = ΔH_reactants_atomized - ΔH_atomization(molecule)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**5. Convert the Answer to the Required Units**\n\nThe options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. We need to check which one matches. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. This does not match option B or D directly. Option A has the right number but wrong units (kJ/g). Let's convert our answer to kJ/g and see if it matches option C.\n\n*   Calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Convert ΔH_f from kJ/mol to kJ/g.\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value of approximately 11.44 kJ/g matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given data\ndH_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nBE_HH = 100       # kJ/mol\nBE_CC = 200       # kJ/mol\nBE_C_dbl_C = 300  # kJ/mol\nBE_CH = 400       # kJ/mol\n\n# Atom and bond counts for C12H22\nnum_C_atoms = 12\nnum_H_atoms = 22\nnum_H2_molecules = num_H_atoms / 2\nnum_CC_bonds = 9\nnum_C_dbl_C_bonds = 2\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\n\n# 1.

Calculate molar mass (using integer masses as is common for such problems)\nmolar_mass = (num_C_atoms * 12) + (num_H_atoms * 1)\n\n# 5.
