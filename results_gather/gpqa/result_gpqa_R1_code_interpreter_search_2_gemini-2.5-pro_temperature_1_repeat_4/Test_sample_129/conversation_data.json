    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The problem involves the concept of cosmological redshift. As the universe expands, the wavelength of light from distant objects gets stretched. The relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the wavelength emitted at the source (the rest wavelength, λ_rest) is given by the formula:\n    `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest`\n    where `z` is the redshift.\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The light being absorbed is the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen. This is a specific spectral line with a well-known rest wavelength.\n    *   The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is `λ_rest ≈ 1216 Å` (Angstroms), which is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n\n3.  **Identify the constraint:** The detection is to be done with \"optical ground-based telescopes\". This imposes a limit on the wavelengths that can be observed. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation. For light to reach a telescope on the ground, its wavelength must be longer than the \"atmospheric cutoff\".\n\n4.  **Determine the observable wavelength range:** The term \"optical\" in astronomy can be ambiguous.\n    *   A technical definition refers to the entire window of atmospheric transparency, which begins in the near-ultraviolet at about 3200 Å (320 nm).\n    *   A more common, general-purpose definition refers to the *visible spectrum*, which the human eye can see. This range conventionally starts at violet light, around 4000 Å (400 nm).\n\n5.  **Formulate the calculation for the lower limit:** We are looking for the *lower limit* on the redshift (`z_min`). This corresponds to the case where the redshift is just large enough to shift the Lyman-alpha line to the *shortest possible* wavelength (`λ_obs_min`) that can be detected by a ground-based optical telescope.\n    Rearranging the redshift formula to solve for `z`:\n    `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`\n    So, `z_min = (λ_obs_min / λ_rest) - 1`\n\n6.  **Calculate the redshift using the visible spectrum definition:** In many educational and multiple-choice contexts, \"optical\" is used as a synonym for \"visible\". Let's assume the shortest observable wavelength is the start of the visible spectrum, `λ_obs_min ≈ 4000 Å`.\n\n    ```python\n    # Rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms.\n    lambda_rest = 1216\n    \n    # Minimum observable wavelength for a ground-based optical telescope.\n    # We assume \"optical\" refers to the visible spectrum, which starts around 4000 Angstroms.\n    lambda_obs_min = 4000\n    \n    # Calculate the lower limit on the redshift.\n    z_min = (lambda_obs_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n    \n    print(z_min)\n    ```\n    \n    Executing this code gives:\n    `2.289473684210526`\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The calculated minimum redshift is `z_min ≈ 2.29`.\n    The options are:\n    A) 2.4\n    B) 3\n    C) 1.2\n    D) 1.9\n\n    The calculated value of 2.29 is very close to option A (2.4). The slight difference might be due to using a slightly different value for the edge of the visible spectrum (e.g., using 4100 Å would give z ≈ 2.37) or simply because the options are rounded estimates. Option A is the best fit for this interpretation.\n\n8.  **Final check:**\n    *   If z = 1.9 (Option D), λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 3526 Å. This is in the near-UV. While technically observable by advanced spectrographs, it's not in the *visible* spectrum.\n    *   If z = 2.4 (Option A), λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + 2.4) = 4134 Å. This is in the violet/blue part of the visible spectrum and is readily observable.\n    *   Since the question asks for an *estimate* and uses the general term \"optical\", relying on the common definition of the visible spectrum is the most robust approach.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable estimate for the lower limit on the redshift is 2.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
