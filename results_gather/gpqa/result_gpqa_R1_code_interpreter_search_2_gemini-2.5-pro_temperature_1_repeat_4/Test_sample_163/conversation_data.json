    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M1 / M2).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n        *   It is an eclipsing binary.\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n        *   It is an eclipsing binary.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Formula:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can measure the radial velocities of both stars), the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K_total = K1 + K2) by the following formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    Where:\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Eclipsing\" Information:** The fact that both systems are \"eclipsing\" is crucial. An eclipse can only happen if we are viewing the orbital plane nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. We can assume `sin³(i)` is the same for both systems and is equal to 1.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n    `M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₁)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₂)) ]`\n\n    The constants `2 * π * G` cancel out. Since we assume `sin³(i₁) ≈ sin³(i₂) ≈ 1`, these terms also cancel out. The formula simplifies to:\n    `M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * ( (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) )³`\n\n6.  **Calculate the necessary components:**\n    *   **Period Ratio (P1 / P2):**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   `P1 / P2 = 2 / 1 = 2`\n    *   **Sum of Velocities for System 1 (K1_total):**\n        *   `K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   **Sum of Velocities for System 2 (K2_total):**\n        *   `K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n    *   **Velocity Sum Ratio (K1_total / K2_total):**\n        *   `K1_total / K2_total = 15 / 25 = 3 / 5 = 0.6`\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Mass Ratio:** Substitute the calculated components back into the simplified ratio formula:\n    `M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216`\n    `M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated ratio is `0.432`.\n    *   A) ~ 0.4\n    *   B) ~ 0.7\n    *   C) ~ 1.2\n    *   D) ~ 0.6\n\n    The value `0.432` is closest to `0.4`.\n\nI will use a python script to verify the numerical calculation.\n\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # Period in years\nK1a = 10.0 # Radial velocity amplitude in km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # Radial velocity amplitude in km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # Period in years\nK2a = 15.0 # Radial velocity amplitude in km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # Radial velocity amplitude in km/s\n\n# The ratio of the total masses M1/M2 is given by the formula:\n# M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * ((K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b))^3\n# The units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) are consistent and will cancel out,\n# so no conversion to SI units is necessary.\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_total = K1a + K1b\nK2_total = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n\n>>> 0.432\nThe calculation confirms that the mass ratio is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The total mass of a binary system (M) can be determined from Kepler's third law, which for a spectroscopic binary system is expressed as:\n`M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³)/(2 * pi * G * sin³(i))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars (`m1 + m2`).\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (`M1`) to the mass of system_2 (`M2`).\n\n`M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * pi * G * sin³(i₁)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * pi * G * sin³(i₂)) ]`\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This is a crucial piece of information, as eclipses only occur when the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is close to 90 degrees for both systems. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. We can therefore assume `sin³(i₁)` is approximately equal to `sin³(i₂)` and they both are equal to 1.\n\nThe constants `2 * pi * G` and the `sin³(i)` terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n`M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * ( (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) )³`\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (`P1`) = 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (`K1a`, `K1b`) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (`K1a + K1b`) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (`P2`) = 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (`K2a`, `K2b`) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (`K2a + K2b`) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n`M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³`\n`M1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³`\n`M1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216`\n`M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
