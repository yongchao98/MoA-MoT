    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    This means:\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum of electron 1)\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum of electron 2)\n    *   $l = 2$ (total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n    *   $m = -1$ (the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:**\n    A measurement is made of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    The eigenstates of these operators are the *uncoupled* states, denoted by $|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2>$, or simply $|m_1, m_2>$ in this context since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are fixed at 1.\n    The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ are $m_1\\hbar$ and the eigenvalues of $L_{2z}$ are $m_2\\hbar$. For a p-orbital ($l=1$), the possible values for $m_1$ and $m_2$ are -1, 0, and 1.\n\n3.  **Identify the Target Outcome:**\n    We want to find the joint probability of getting:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_2 = -1$.\n    So, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$.\n\n4.  **Relate the Coupled and Uncoupled Bases:**\n    The connection between the coupled basis $|l, m>$ and the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2>$ is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. A coupled state can be written as a linear combination (superposition) of uncoupled states:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m> |m_1, m_2>$\n    The term $<l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the state to be $|m_1, m_2>$ when it is initially in the state $|l, m>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state:\n    $P(m_1, m_2) = |<m_1, m_2 | l, m>|^2$\n    In our specific case, this is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n    The inner product $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is precisely the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1=1, m_1=-1, l_2=1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1>$.\n\n6.  **Apply the Selection Rule:**\n    A fundamental property (a selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the z-components of the angular momentum add up, i.e.,\n    $m_1 + m_2 = m$\n    Let's check this condition for our target outcome:\n    *   $m_1 = -1$\n    *   $m_2 = -1$\n    *   Sum: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$\n    Now compare this to the total z-component quantum number of the initial state:\n    *   $m = -1$\n    Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m = -1$, the condition is not met.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Because the selection rule $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n    **Alternative Explanation (Conservation Principle):**\n    The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    The final state we are asking about, $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Its eigenvalue is $(m_1 + m_2)\\hbar = (-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n    Since the initial state and the final state are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) but have different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ vs $-2\\hbar$), they must be orthogonal. The probability of a transition from the initial state to this final state upon measurement is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>"
