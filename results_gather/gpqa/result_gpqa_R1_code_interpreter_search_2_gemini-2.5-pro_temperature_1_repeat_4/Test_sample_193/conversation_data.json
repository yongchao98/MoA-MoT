    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThis gives a total of 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible configurations or states for the system.\n\n**2. The Energy Equation**\n\nThe energy of the system for a given state is defined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\nwhere J is a coupling constant.\n\n**3. The Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function, Z, is a sum over all possible states of the system, where each state is weighted by its Boltzmann factor, `exp(-βE)`.\nZ = Σ_states exp(-βE)\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\n**4. Enumerate All States and Calculate Their Energies**\n\nWe need to list all 8 possible states and calculate the energy for each one. A state is defined by the triplet (S1, S2, S3).\n\n| State # | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 | Energy (E) | Term in Z: exp(-βE) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1+1+1 = 3 | -3J | exp(3Jβ) |\n| 2 | +1 | +1 | -1 | (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1-1-1 = -1 | J | exp(-Jβ) |\n| 3 | +1 | -1 | +1 | (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = -1+1-1 = -1 | J | exp(-Jβ) |\n| 4 | -1 | +1 | +1 | (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = -1-1+1 = -1 | J | exp(-Jβ) |\n| 5 | +1 | -1 | -1 | (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1-1+1 = -1 | J | exp(-Jβ) |\n| 6 | -1 | +1 | -1 | (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = -1+1-1 = -1 | J | exp(-Jβ) |\n| 7 | -1 | -1 | +1 | (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1-1-1 = -1 | J | exp(-Jβ) |\n| 8 | -1 | -1 | -1 | (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1+1+1 = 3 | -3J | exp(3Jβ) |\n\n**5. Group States by Energy Level (Degeneracy)**\n\nWe can see that there are only two distinct energy values: -3J and J.\n\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    This energy occurs for two states: State 1 (all spins up) and State 8 (all spins down).\n    The degeneracy (number of states with this energy) is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E2 = J:**\n    This energy occurs for the remaining six states (States 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), where one spin is different from the other two.\n    The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n**6. Calculate the Partition Function Z**\n\nThe partition function can now be calculated by summing the contributions from each energy level, multiplied by its degeneracy:\nZ = g1 * exp(-βE1) + g2 * exp(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
