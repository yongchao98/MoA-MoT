    "An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. The characteristics of this radiation depend on the nature of the oscillation, which can be analyzed using a multipole expansion. The leading terms in this expansion are the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and so on. The lowest-order non-vanishing term typically dominates the radiation.\n\n**1. Identifying the Radiation Type**\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". This description can be interpreted in two primary ways:\n\n*   **Electric Dipole Radiation:** The spheroid, as a rigid body, could be oscillating along the z-axis. This motion of the center of charge creates a time-varying electric dipole moment `p(t)`. This is the simplest and most common form of radiation from a compact source.\n*   **Electric Quadrupole Radiation:** The phrase \"oscillating charge distribution\" combined with the specific \"spheroid\" shape could imply that the shape itself is oscillating. For example, a spherical charge distribution could be deforming into a prolate spheroid, then back to a sphere, then into an oblate spheroid, and so on. This type of oscillation, if it occurs symmetrically about the origin, has a zero electric dipole moment but a non-zero, time-varying electric quadrupole moment.\n\nGiven that the problem specifies a non-trivial shape (spheroid) for the distribution, it is reasonable to infer that this information is key to the problem. This points towards the second interpretation, where the shape's oscillation is the source of radiation, leading to electric quadrupole radiation. We will proceed with this assumption, as it uses all the information provided in the problem statement.\n\n**2. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) for an oscillating linear electric quadrupole along the z-axis is given by:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the angle with the z-axis.\n\nThe function `f` in the problem is this power per unit solid angle. So, `f(λ, θ) = C(λ) sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`, where `C(λ)` contains the dependence on wavelength and other constants.\n\n**3. Calculating the Fraction of Maximum Power**\n\nThe maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs at the angle `θ_max` where the function `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` is maximum.\nWe can rewrite `g(θ)` as:\n`g(θ) = (sin(θ)cos(θ))² = (sin(2θ)/2)² = sin²(2θ) / 4`\nThe maximum value of `sin²(2θ)` is 1, which occurs when `2θ = 90°`, so `θ_max = 45°`.\nThe maximum value of `g(θ)` is `g(45°) = sin²(90°)/4 = 1/4`.\nSo, the maximum power is `A = C(λ) * (1/4)`.\n\nWe need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°` as a fraction of `A`.\nFirst, let's calculate `g(30°)`:\n`g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3/2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`.\nThe power at `30°` is `P(30°) = C(λ) * g(30°) = C(λ) * (3/16)`.\n\nThe fraction of `A` radiated at `30°` is:\n`Fraction = P(30°) / A = (C(λ) * 3/16) / (C(λ) * 1/4) = (3/16) * 4 = 12/16 = 3/4`.\n\n**4. Wavelength Dependence**\n\nThe power radiated by an electric multipole of order `l` is proportional to `ω^(2l+2)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   For an electric dipole, `l=1`, so Power `∝ ω⁴`.\n*   For an electric quadrupole, `l=2`, so Power `∝ ω⁶`.\n\nSince `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ` is the wavelength, the power dependence on wavelength is:\n`Power ∝ (1/λ)⁶ = λ⁻⁶`\nTherefore, a possible form of the function `f` has a `λ⁻⁶` dependence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining our results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **3/4**.\n*   A possible form of the radiation function `f` has a wavelength dependence of **`λ⁻⁶`**.\n\nThese results match option C.\n\nLet's quickly verify the calculation with a script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The angular part of the power distribution for a linear electric quadrupole\ndef angular_factor(theta_deg):\n    theta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n    return (np.sin(theta_rad)**2) * (np.cos(theta_rad)**2)\n\n# The maximum of the angular factor occurs at 45 degrees\nmax_factor = angular_factor(45.0)\n\n# The angular factor at the specified angle of 30 degrees\nfactor_at_30 = angular_factor(30.0)\n\n# The fraction is the ratio of the factor at 30 degrees to the maximum factor\nfraction = factor_at_30 / max_factor\n\nprint(f\"Maximum value of angular factor (at 45 deg): {max_factor:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Value of angular factor at 30 deg: {factor_at_30:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Fraction of maximum power at 30 deg: {fraction:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\nMaximum value of angular factor (at 45 deg): 0.2500\nValue of angular factor at 30 deg: 0.1875\nFraction of maximum power at 30 deg: 0.7500\n<<<\n\nThe calculation confirms that the fraction is 0.75, which is 3/4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution that is spheroidal in shape with a symmetry axis suggests a time-varying electric quadrupole moment. A simple oscillating dipole would not typically be described by its shape in this manner. The oscillation of the spheroid's shape (e.g., from prolate to oblate and back) creates a time-varying quadrupole moment.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power (Electric Quadrupole)**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) for a linear electric quadrupole oscillating along the z-axis is proportional to `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`, where `θ` is the polar angle measured from the z-axis.\nSo, the function `f` has the form:\n`f(λ, θ) = C(λ) * sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\nwhere `C(λ)` contains all the dependencies on wavelength `λ` and other constants.\n\n**2. Finding the Maximum Power**\n\nThe radiated power is maximum when the angular term `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` is maximum.\nWe can rewrite this term using the double-angle identity `sin(2θ) = 2sin(θ)cos(θ)`:\n`g(θ) = (sin(θ)cos(θ))² = (sin(2θ)/2)² = sin²(2θ)/4`\nThe maximum value of `sin²(2θ)` is 1. This occurs when `2θ = 90°`, which means `θ = 45°`.\nTherefore, the maximum value of the angular term is `g_max = 1/4`.\nThe maximum radiated power `A` is:\n`A = f_max = C(λ) * g_max = C(λ) * (1/4)`\n\n**3. Calculating the Power at θ = 30°**\n\nNow, we calculate the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We evaluate the angular term `g(30°)`:\n`g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3/2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`\nThe power at 30° is:\n`P(30°) = C(λ) * g(30°) = C(λ) * (3/16)`\n\n**4. Finding the Fraction**\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio `P(30°)/A`:\n`Fraction = P(30°) / A = (C(λ) * 3/16) / (C(λ) * 1/4) = (3/16) * 4 = 12/16 = 3/4`\n\n**5. Wavelength Dependence**\n\nThe total power radiated by an electric multipole of order `l` is proportional to `ω^(2l+2)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation.\n*   For an electric dipole, `l=1`, so Power `∝ ω⁴`.\n*   For an electric quadrupole, `l=2`, so Power `∝ ω⁶`.\n\nSince we've identified the radiation as electric quadrupole, the radiated power `f` is proportional to `ω⁶`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\nTherefore, the power dependence on wavelength is:\n`Power ∝ (1/λ)⁶ = λ⁻⁶`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **3/4**, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power function `f` is **`λ⁻⁶`**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
