    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product E and the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) and ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH). BF₃ is a Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a cyclic thioacetal (a 1,3-dithiane). The carbonyl group of the aldehyde reacts with the two thiol groups of EDT.\n*   **Product A:** The product is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n     \n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n*   **Reactants:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane) and butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic because the adjacent sulfur atoms stabilize the resulting carbanion. This is a key step in umpolung (polarity inversion) chemistry.\n*   **Product B:** The product is the lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n     \n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n*   **Reactants:** Product B (the carbanion) and bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br).\n*   **Reaction:** The carbanion B is a potent nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. An ethyl group is added to the C2 position.\n*   **Product C:** The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n     \n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n*   **Reactants:** Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane) and a reagent system for thioacetal hydrolysis (HgCl₂, H₂O, H⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is the deprotection of the thioacetal, converting it back to a carbonyl group.\n*   **Product D:** The resulting ketone is 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone).\n     \n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n*   **Reactants:** Product D (3-pentanone), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane, and BuLi.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction.\n    1.  **Ylide formation:** First, PPh₃ reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) to form a phosphonium salt, [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻. Then, the strong base BuLi deprotonates the carbon attached to the phosphorus, forming the phosphorus ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    2.  **Wittig reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide, forming a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product E:** The reaction is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O. The final product E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n     \n\n**Analysis of the 13C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n*   **Structure of E:** 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    ```\n          CH₂-CH₃\n         /\n    CH₃-CH₂-C = C-CH₂-CH₃\n              \\\n               CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry along the C=C double bond and a C₂ axis of rotation perpendicular to it. Due to this symmetry, many carbon atoms are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Equivalent Carbons:**\n    1.  **Alkene carbons (C=C):** The two carbons forming the double bond are in identical environments. They will produce a single signal.\n    2.  **Methylene carbons (-CH₂-):** There are four ethyl groups, and all four are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. Therefore, the four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons are equivalent and will produce a single signal.\n    3.  **Methyl carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four methyl (-CH₃) carbons at the ends of the ethyl groups are all equivalent and will produce a single signal.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The 13C-NMR spectrum of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene will show a total of **3 signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
