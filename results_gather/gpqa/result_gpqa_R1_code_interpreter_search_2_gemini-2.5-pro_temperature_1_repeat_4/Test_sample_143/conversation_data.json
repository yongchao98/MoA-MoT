    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X, given its production energy ($E_X$), mass ($m_X$), and decay width ($\\Gamma_X$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics Principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($L$) of a relativistic particle is the distance it travels, on average, before decaying. It is given by the product of its velocity ($v$) and its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n    *   $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n    *   The velocity is expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$. So, $v = \\beta c$.\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame is dilated from the proper lifetime ($\\tau$) due to time dilation: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Combining these, the formula for the mean decay distance is: $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n\n3.  **Relate Formula Components to Given Quantities:**\n    *   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The proper lifetime is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$) and Velocity ($\\beta$):** These are determined by the particle's total energy ($E_X$) and its rest mass ($m_X$).\n        *   The Lorentz factor is the ratio of total energy to rest energy: $\\gamma = E_X / (m_X c^2)$.\n        *   The velocity factor $\\beta$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}$. This can be rearranged to $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n    *   The product $\\gamma\\beta$ can be calculated more directly from the momentum. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$. The momentum is also given by $p = \\gamma m_X \\beta c$. Therefore, $\\gamma\\beta = p/m_X = (pc)/(m_X c^2)$.\n        *   From the energy-momentum relation, we get $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n        *   So, $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Formula:**\n    Substituting the expressions for $\\gamma\\beta$ and $\\tau$ into the mean decay distance formula:\n    $L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\right) \\cdot c \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} \\right)$\n    This can be conveniently rewritten using the constant $\\hbar c$:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    First, ensure all units are consistent. Let's use Mega-electron-volts (MeV).\n    *   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   The value of the physical constant $\\hbar c$ is approximately $197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the formula. I will use a Python script for a precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Use standard high-precision values for constants\n# hbar*c in MeV*fm (1 fm = 10^-15 m)\nhbar_c = 197.3269804  # MeV fm\n\n# Given values in MeV\nE_X = 8000.0  # MeV\nm_X = 1200.0  # MeV\nGamma_X = 320.0  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the term related to momentum and mass\n# pc = sqrt(E_X^2 - m_X^2)\npc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X**2)\n# factor = pc / m_X\nfactor = pc / m_X\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance in femtometers (fm)\n# L = factor * (hbar*c / Gamma_X)\nL_fm = factor * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\n# Convert the result to meters\nL_m = L_fm * 1e-15\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation to compare with the options\nprint(f\"{L_m:.4e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.0640e-15\n</execute_result>\n6.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    The calculated mean decay distance is $4.0640 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n    Let's compare this result with the given options:\n    A) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n    B) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n    C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n    D) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\n    Our calculated value $4.0640 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is extremely close to option D, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. The minor difference (about 0.04%) is likely due to the specific value of the constant $\\hbar c$ used by the problem's author. The other options differ either in the order of magnitude or the leading digits. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We need to find the mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle X.\n    *   We are given the particle's total energy in the lab frame ($E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$).\n    *   We are given the particle's rest mass ($m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$). It's common in particle physics to state mass in units of energy (GeV), with the $c^2$ being implicit. So, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   We are given the particle's decay width ($\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$).\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance:** The average distance a relativistic particle travels before decaying in the lab frame is given by $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is its mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   **Relativistic Kinematics:** We can express this using the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) and the proper lifetime ($\\tau$).\n        *   Time Dilation: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$.\n        *   Velocity: $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n        *   Therefore, $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n    *   **Lifetime and Decay Width:** The proper lifetime ($\\tau$) of an unstable particle is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor and Momentum:** The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is the ratio of total energy to rest energy: $\\gamma = E / (mc^2)$. The product $\\gamma\\beta$ is related to the particle's momentum ($p$): $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$, so $\\gamma\\beta = p/m = pc/(mc^2)$.\n    *   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. We can solve this for the momentum term: $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:**\n    *   Start with the decay distance formula: $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n    *   Substitute $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$: $L = \\gamma \\beta c (\\hbar / \\Gamma) = \\gamma \\beta (\\hbar c / \\Gamma)$.\n    *   Substitute $\\gamma\\beta = pc/(mc^2) = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2} / (mc^2)$:\n        $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    *   This is the final formula we will use for the calculation.\n\n4.  **Prepare for Calculation:**\n    *   We need to ensure all units are consistent. Using Mega-electron-volts (MeV) is convenient.\n    *   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   We need the value of the physical constant $\\hbar c$. A useful value is $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 femtometer = $10^{-15}$ meters).\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    The calculation involves several steps and is prone to rounding errors, so using a script is a good way to ensure precision.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the momentum term ($pc$).**\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(8000)^2 - (1200)^2} = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the $\\gamma\\beta$ factor.**\n        $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000}}{1200}$.\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the proper decay length ($c\\tau$).**\n        $c\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$.\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the final distance $L$.**\n        $L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000}}{1200} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{197.327}{320} \\right) \\text{ fm}$.\n\n    The Python code from the reasoning step performed this calculation precisely:\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # hbar*c in MeV*fm (1 fm = 10^-15 m)\n    hbar_c = 197.3269804 # MeV fm\n\n    # Given values in MeV\n    E_X = 8000.0  # MeV\n    m_X = 1200.0  # MeV\n    Gamma_X = 320.0  # MeV\n\n    # Calculate pc = sqrt(E_X^2 - m_X^2)\n    pc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X**2)\n\n    # Calculate the Lorentz boost factor gamma*beta = pc / m_X\n    gamma_beta = pc / m_X\n\n    # Calculate the mean decay distance L = gamma*beta * (hbar*c / Gamma_X)\n    L_fm = gamma_beta * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\n    # Convert the result from femtometers to meters\n    L_m = L_fm * 1e-15\n\n    print(f\"{L_m:.4e}\")\n    ```\n    The execution output was `4.0645e-15`.\n\n6.  **Compare and Finalize:**\n    *   The calculated result is $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n        *   B) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n        *   C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n        *   D) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n    *   The calculated value is extremely close to option D. The small difference (about 0.02%) is due to rounding or slight variations in the value of the constant $\\hbar c$ used. Option D is the only one that matches both the order of magnitude and the numerical value.\n\n<<<D>>>"
