    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product of both reactions, after workup, is a lactone named \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\". Let's break down this structure:\n*   **Pyran:** A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom. \"Tetrahydro\" means it is fully saturated.\n*   **-2-one:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position. According to IUPAC nomenclature for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is designated as position 1. Therefore, the carbonyl carbon is adjacent to the ring oxygen. This structure is a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The C4 carbon is a stereocenter. The product of reaction A is the (R)-enantiomer, and the product of reaction B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThe structure is a δ-lactone (a six-membered ring lactone). The carbon chain that forms the ring (excluding the ring oxygen) is 5 carbons long. The ethyl group is on the third carbon from the carbonyl group (at the γ-position).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a derivative of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   **Pentanoic acid:** The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid (-COOH) on a 5-carbon chain. The carboxyl carbon is C1.\n*   **3-ethyl:** An ethyl group is on C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo:** This is a slightly unconventional name for an ester group at the C5 position. A more standard name would be \"5-(isobutoxycarbonyl)\". This describes a molecule that is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n*   **Structure:** HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5).\n*   **Key features:** This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). It also has a stereocenter at C3, the carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is typically deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is unreactive towards LiBH₄.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains intact (as a lithium carboxylate).\n    2.  The intermediate formed is HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) after the initial reaction and before workup.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate and catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the C5-hydroxyl group attacks the C1-carboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not occur at the C3 stereocenter. Therefore, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained from the starting material to the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + BH₃ + H⁺\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a unique reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains intact.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is isobutyl-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed C1-hydroxyl group attacks the C5-ester carbonyl. This forms the six-membered lactone ring and releases isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction A, the reactions do not affect the C3 stereocenter, so its configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
