    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Write the chemical equation for the equilibrium.**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by the reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The problem asks for the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions, which are formed when the complex dissociates. Therefore, it is more intuitive to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant.**\n    The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$):\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to track concentrations.**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ complex that dissociates. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, for every 'x' moles of the complex that dissociate, 'x' moles of $Ca^{2+}$ and 'x' moles of $EDTA^{4-}$ are formed.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.**\n    $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Solve for x.**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n\n    Let's perform this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# Simplified equation: x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The concentration of Ca2+ is x\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is:\n$x = [Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    A) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    B) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    D) 2.0x10^-2 M\n\n    Our calculated value, $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation reaction and its equilibrium constant ($K_f$) are given as:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nSince we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, it's easier to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Set Up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n**3. Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression**\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations back into the formation constant ($K_f$) expression:\n$K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n**4. Simplify and Solve for x**\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is extremely large, the equilibrium lies far to the side of the complex. This means very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation now becomes:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nNow, we solve for x by taking the square root:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nSince we defined x as the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$, we have:\n$[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
