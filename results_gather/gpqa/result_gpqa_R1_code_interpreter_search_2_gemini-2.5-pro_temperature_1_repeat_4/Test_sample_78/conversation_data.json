    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Starting Material Options**\n\n*   The molecular formula of Compound X is given as C11H12O.\n*   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: `(2 * C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2 = (2 * 11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 6`. This suggests the presence of an aromatic ring (4 degrees) and two additional degrees of unsaturation (e.g., a double bond and a ring).\n*   Let's check the molecular formulas of the given options:\n    *   A) 2-styrylepoxide (assuming 2-styryloxirane, C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2): C10H10O. Incorrect formula.\n    *   B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane (C6H5-CH=C(CH3)-CH(O)CH2): C12H14O. Incorrect formula.\n    *   C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH3): C11H12O. **Correct formula.**\n    *   D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2): C11H12O. **Correct formula.**\n*   Therefore, Compound X must be either C or D.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   The reaction involves heating Compound X (a vinyl epoxide) with DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K (130 °C).\n*   DABCO is a non-nucleophilic base, and the high temperature suggests a thermal rearrangement reaction.\n*   Vinyl epoxides are known to undergo rearrangement to form α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds under thermal, acidic, or basic conditions. This is a well-established transformation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra**\n\nLet's deduce the structure of the product from the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR:**\n    *   `δ 197.7`: This high chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), likely from a ketone or aldehyde.\n    *   `δ 21.3` and `δ 28.4`: These are in the typical range for sp³ hybridized carbons, specifically methyl groups (CH₃).\n    *   `δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C)`: These are all in the sp² region for aromatic or vinylic carbons. The presence of two signals corresponding to two carbons each (`126.9 (2C)` and `129.1 (2C)`) strongly suggests a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, specifically a para-substituted ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   `δ 2.28 (3H, s)` and `δ 2.31 (3H, s)`: These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This confirms the presence of two methyl groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n    *   `δ 7.08 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.71 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a para-substituted benzene ring. The large chemical shift difference (Δδ = 0.63 ppm) and the deshielding of the signal at 7.71 ppm indicate that the ring is directly attached to a strong electron-withdrawing group, such as the carbonyl group identified in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   `δ 6.75 (1H, d)` and `δ 7.68 (1H, d)`: These are two doublets, each for one proton, in the vinylic region. This indicates a disubstituted double bond (`-CH=CH-`). The fact that they are doublets implies they are coupled only to each other. The large chemical shift of 7.68 ppm suggests this proton is β to the carbonyl group in a conjugated enone system.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  From the two methyl singlets and the para-substituted aromatic pattern, we can deduce one of the methyls is on the ring. The pattern (`d` at 7.08 and `d` at 7.71) confirms a p-tolyl ketone moiety: `CH₃-C₆H₄-C(=O)-`. This is not consistent with the rest of the fragments.\n    2.  Let's reconsider. What if the ketone is not directly on the ring? Let's try to assemble the pieces: a `p-tolyl` group (CH₃-C₆H₄-), an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃), and a double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    3.  Let's try the structure: **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n        *   Structure: `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n        *   This structure has all the required pieces. Let's check if it matches the NMR data.\n        *   `Ar-CH₃`: One methyl singlet (~2.3-2.4 ppm). **Matches δ 2.31.**\n        *   `CO-CH₃`: A second methyl singlet (~2.3-2.4 ppm). **Matches δ 2.28.**\n        *   `-CH=CH-`: The proton α to the C=O (`=CH-CO`) would be a doublet near 6.7 ppm. **Matches δ 6.75.** The proton β to the C=O (`Ar-CH=`) would be a doublet near 7.5 ppm. **Matches δ 7.68.**\n        *   `Ar-H`: A p-tolyl group attached to a vinyl group would show two doublets. The provided shifts (7.08 and 7.71) show a larger-than-expected separation but are qualitatively correct for a `p-disubstituted` ring. The rest of the data fits perfectly. This structure is the most plausible product.\n\n**4. Connecting the Product to the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Product:** (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one (`CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`)\n*   We need to determine which starting material, C or D, can rearrange to form this product.\n\n*   **Starting Material C:** 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (`C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH₃`). This compound contains a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), not a p-tolyl group (CH₃-C₆H₄-). It is impossible to form the tolyl-containing product from this starting material.\n\n*   **Starting Material D:** 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (`CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`). This compound contains the necessary p-tolyl group. The rearrangement of this vinyloxirane would proceed as follows:\n    *   `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-` moiety remains intact.\n    *   The epoxide unit `-CH(O)CH₂` rearranges to an acetyl group `-C(=O)CH₃`. This is a known and facile transformation for such systems.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe product of the reaction is (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This product can only be formed from the starting material that contains a p-tolyl group, which is Compound D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
