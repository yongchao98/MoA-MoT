    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γS · (B z_hat) = -γB Sz`.\n    *   Alignment means the system is in the lowest energy state, or the state where the projection of `μ` onto `B` is maximized. Since `μz = γSz`, and we assume `γ > 0`, we need to maximize the eigenvalue of `Sz`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). The state with the maximum magnetic moment along Z is the spin-up state.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`. In matrix form, this is `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction, with the same magnitude `B`. The new magnetic field is `B_new = B y_hat`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian `H` governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0`.\n    *   `H = -μ · B_new = -γS · (B y_hat) = -γB Sy`.\n    *   The spin operator `Sy` is given by `Sy = (ħ/2)σy`, where `σy` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   So, `H = -γB(ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   `U(t) = exp(-i[-γB Sy]t / ħ) = exp(iγB t Sy / ħ)`.\n    *   Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The expression becomes `U(t) = exp(iωt Sy / ħ)`.\n    *   Substitute `Sy = (ħ/2)σy`: `U(t) = exp(iωt (ħ/2)σy / ħ) = exp(i(ωt/2)σy)`.\n    *   We use the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix: `exp(iθ n·σ) = Icos(θ) + i(n·σ)sin(θ)`. Here, `n` is the unit vector `y_hat` and `θ = ωt/2`.\n    *   `U(t) = Icos(ωt/2) + iσy sin(ωt/2) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + i sin(ωt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`.\n    *   Now, we find the state at time `t`:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]] = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    *   The operator for the z-component of the magnetic moment is `μz = γSz`. We need to calculate its expectation value, `<μz>(t) = <ψ(t)|μz|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   `<μz>(t) = γ <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   The bra vector is `<ψ(t)| = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`.\n    *   The `Sz` operator is `(ħ/2)σz = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n    *   First, `Sz|ψ(t)> = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]] = (ħ/2)[[cos(ωt/2)], [sin(ωt/2)]]`.\n    *   Then, `<Sz>(t) = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[cos(ωt/2)], [sin(ωt/2)]]`\n    *   `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`.\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    *   `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) cos(2 * ωt/2) = (ħ/2) cos(ωt)`.\n\n5.  **Identify the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`.\n    *   Substituting `ω = γB`, we have `<μz>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation. The term inside the cosine is `(γB)t`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`, which is `γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the magnetic moment vector `⟨μ⟩` precesses around the new magnetic field `B_new` with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. Since the initial moment is along the Z-axis and the field is along the Y-axis, the moment vector rotates in the X-Z plane, and its Z-component oscillates as `cos(ωt)`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
