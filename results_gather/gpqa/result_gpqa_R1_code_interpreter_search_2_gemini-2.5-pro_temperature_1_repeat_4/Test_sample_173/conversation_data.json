    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information:**\n    *   Initial nucleus: Mass M, at rest. Rest-mass energy $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300$ GeV.\n    *   Fission products: Two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   Mass relationship: $m_1 = 2m_2$ (Let fragment 1 be the more massive one).\n    *   Mass sum relationship: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n    *   Goal: Find the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy ($T_1$) and the classical kinetic energy ($T_{1,classic}$) for the more massive fragment ($m_1$).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments:**\n    We have a system of two equations for the rest-mass energies ($m_1c^2$ and $m_2c^2$):\n    *   $m_1c^2 = 2(m_2c^2)$\n    *   $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 0.99(Mc^2)$\n\n    Substitute the initial energy value:\n    *   $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 0.99 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 297 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n    Now substitute the first equation into the second:\n    *   $2(m_2c^2) + m_2c^2 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $3(m_2c^2) = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    Now find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    *   $m_1c^2 = 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    The total energy is conserved. The initial energy is the rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus, $Mc^2$. The final energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the fragments.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $Mc^2 = (m_1c^2 + T_1) + (m_2c^2 + T_2)$\n    *   $Mc^2 = (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + (T_1 + T_2)$\n\n    The total kinetic energy released, $Q$, is $T_1 + T_2$.\n    *   $Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n    *   $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Kinetic Energy, $T_{1,classic}$:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n        *   $p_1 = p_2$\n    *   **Classical Relationship:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n    *   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n        *   $T_1 = p_1^2 / (2m_1)$ and $T_2 = p_2^2 / (2m_2)$.\n        *   Since $p_1 = p_2$, the ratio is $T_1 / T_2 = m_2 / m_1$.\n        *   Given $m_1 = 2m_2$, we have $T_1 / T_2 = 1/2$, or $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n    *   **Solve for $T_{1,classic}$:**\n        *   $T_1 + T_2 = Q$\n        *   $T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n        *   $3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n        *   $T_{1,classic} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy, $T_1$:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** $p_1 = p_2$, so $p_1^2c^2 = p_2^2c^2$.\n    *   **Relativistic Relationship:** The energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, which means $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   Equating the momenta:\n        *   $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy is $Mc^2$, which is conserved.\n        *   $E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2$, so $E_2 = Mc^2 - E_1$.\n    *   Substitute $E_2$ into the momentum equation:\n        *   $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2 - E_1)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n        *   $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2)^2 - 2(Mc^2)E_1 + E_1^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n    *   Solve for $E_1$ (the total energy of the massive fragment):\n        *   $2(Mc^2)E_1 = (Mc^2)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n        *   $E_1 = \\frac{(Mc^2)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2}{2(Mc^2)}$\n    *   Plug in the energy values (in GeV):\n        *   $E_1 = \\frac{300^2 + 198^2 - 99^2}{2 \\times 300} = \\frac{90000 + 39204 - 9801}{600} = \\frac{119403}{600} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is $T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2$:\n        *   $T_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Difference:**\n    *   The difference is $\\Delta T_1 = T_1 - T_{1,classic}$.\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n7.  **Convert to MeV:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation is performed using a Python script.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\n\n# Initial state\nM_E = 300.0  # Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus\n\n# Final state relationships\n# Sum of rest-masses of fragments is 99% of initial mass\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M => m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2\nsum_m_E = 0.99 * M_E\n\n# One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\n# m1 = 2 * m2 => m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2\n\n# Solve for rest-mass energies of fragments\n# m1_E = 2 * m2_E\n# 2 * m2_E + m2_E = sum_m_E\n# 3 * m2_E = sum_m_E\nm2_E = sum_m_E / 3.0\nm1_E = 2.0 * m2_E\n\n# Total kinetic energy released (Q value)\nQ = M_E - sum_m_E\n\n# --- Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1 ---\n# From conservation of energy and momentum, the total energy of fragment 1 is:\n# E1 = ( (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ) / ( 2 * M*c^2 )\nE1 = (M_E**2 + m1_E**2 - m2_E**2) / (2 * M_E)\n\n# The kinetic energy is T1 = E1 - m1*c^2\nT1_relativistic = E1 - m1_E\n\n# --- Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation of T1 ---\n# From conservation of momentum (p1=p2) in classical mechanics:\n# T = p^2 / (2m) => T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2\n# T1 + T2 = Q\n# T1 + 2*T1 = Q => 3*T1 = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# --- Calculate the difference ---\n# The difference in GeV\ndiff_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndiff_MeV = diff_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{diff_MeV}\")\n```\n>>>\n5.0\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Define the variables and initial conditions:**\n\n*   Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus, $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest.\n*   It fissions into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   Let fragment 1 be the more massive one: $m_1 = 2m_2$. This also means their rest-mass energies are related by $m_1c^2 = 2(m_2c^2)$.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$. In terms of energy, this is $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 0.99(Mc^2)$.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments:**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $m_1c^2 = 2(m_2c^2)$\n2.  $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 0.99 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2(m_2c^2) + m_2c^2 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3(m_2c^2) = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n$m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n$m_1c^2 = 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission:**\n\nThe total energy is conserved. The initial energy is the rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus. The final energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the fragments.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$Mc^2 = (m_1c^2 + T_1) + (m_2c^2 + T_2)$\n$Mc^2 = (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + (T_1 + T_2)$\n\nThe total kinetic energy released, $Q$, is $T_1 + T_2$.\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation ($T_{1,classic}$):**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the fragments is zero. They fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum be $p$. So, $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$. The ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$.\n*   Since $m_1 = 2m_2$, we have $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which means $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n*   **Solve for $T_{1,classic}$:**\n    $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1,classic} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$):**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** $p_1 = p_2$ still holds. So $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$, where $E$ is the total energy ($E = T + mc^2$). This can be rearranged to $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$.\n*   Equating the momenta:\n    $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** $E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. So, $E_2 = 300 - E_1$.\n*   Substitute $E_2$ into the momentum equation (all energies in GeV):\n    $E_1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E_1)^2 - (99)^2$\n    $E_1^2 - 198^2 = 300^2 - 2(300)E_1 + E_1^2 - 99^2$\n*   The $E_1^2$ terms cancel. Rearrange to solve for $E_1$:\n    $600 E_1 = 300^2 + 198^2 - 99^2$\n    $600 E_1 = 90000 + 39204 - 9801 = 119403$\n    $E_1 = \\frac{119403}{600} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   This is the total energy of fragment 1. Its kinetic energy is $T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2$:\n    $T_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**6.
