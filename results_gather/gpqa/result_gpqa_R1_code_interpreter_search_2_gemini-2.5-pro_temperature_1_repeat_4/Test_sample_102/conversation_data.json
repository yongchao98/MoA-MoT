    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent ring is benzene.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are *meta* (1,3- and 1,5-) to each other. This 1,3,5-substitution pattern is a key feature that will guide the synthesis strategy.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the order of reactions.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** A moderately deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** A weakly deactivating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** A group that appears in the reaction sequences (via reduction of -NO2). It is a strongly activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. In strong acid, it is protonated to -NH3+, which is a strongly deactivating *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The goal is a high-yield synthesis, which implies that each step should have high regioselectivity (i.e., it should produce predominantly one desired isomer).\n\n**Option A: i) Acylation; ii) Bromination; iii) Nitration ...**\n*   i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is introduced. It's a *meta*-director.\n*   ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The *meta*-directing -COCH3 group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This step is good.\n*   iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → ? Now we nitrate a ring with -COCH3 (at C1) and -Br (at C3).\n    *   -COCH3 is a *meta*-director, so it directs to C5.\n    *   -Br is an *ortho, para*-director, so it directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   Since the directing effects are conflicting, this reaction will produce a mixture of isomers (e.g., 3-bromo-5-nitro-, 3-bromo-4-nitro-, and 3-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone). It would not be a \"high-yield\" synthesis of the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Furthermore, the subsequent steps (iv-vii) involving reduction and deamination are unnecessary if the product were formed here, suggesting this route is flawed.\n\n**Option B: i) Nitration; ii) Reduction; iii) Diazotization; iv) Deamination...**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene\n*   This sequence of steps i-iv just converts benzene back into benzene. The overall synthesis effectively starts at step v on benzene.\n*   v) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\n*   vi) Bromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → 4-Bromoacetophenone (major product, since -Br is an o,p-director and para is favored sterically).\n*   vii) 4-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Bromo-3-nitroacetophenone. (The -Br directs ortho, and -COCH3 directs meta; both direct to C3). This is not the target molecule.\n\n**Option D: i) Bromination; ii) Nitration; iii) Acylation...**\n*   i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product).\n*   iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ? This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This reaction would not proceed in any significant yield.\n\n**Option C: i) Nitration; ii) Reduction; iii) Acylation; iv) Bromination; v) Nitration; vi) Diazotization; vii) Deamination**\nThis sequence is more complex and uses an amino group as a temporary directing group, which is then removed. This is a powerful strategy for achieving substitution patterns that are otherwise difficult to obtain. Let's trace the synthesis of the final target by making the key intermediate **4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**.\n\n*   i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitrobenzene**.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → **Aniline**.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **4-Aminoacetophenone**. (The acetyl group is introduced *para* to the strongly activating amino group. While direct FC acylation of aniline is complex, this transformation to the para-isomer is a standard procedure, often proceeding via N-acylation followed by a Fries rearrangement).\n*   iv) 4-Aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone**. The very powerful *ortho, para*-directing amino group (-NH2 at C4) directs the incoming bromine to its ortho position (C3).\n*   v) 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**. This is the crucial step. It might seem counterintuitive. In the strong acid medium, the -NH2 group exists in equilibrium with the protonated -NH3+ group. While the -NH3+ ion is a *meta*-director, a small amount of the highly activated unprotonated amine (-NH2) is always present. The reaction proceeds through this highly reactive species.\n    *   Let's look at the directing effects on the unprotonated amine intermediate:\n        *   **-NH2 (at C4):** Strongly activating, *o,p*-director. Directs to C3 (blocked) and **C5**.\n        *   **-COCH3 (at C1):** Deactivating, *m*-director. Directs to **C5**.\n        *   **-Br (at C3):** Deactivating, *o,p*-director. Directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   Both the powerful amino group and the acetyl group strongly favor substitution at **C5**. This concerted directing effect leads to a high yield of the desired 5-nitro product.\n*   vi) 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl → **Benzenediazonium salt intermediate**. The primary amino group (-NH2) is converted to a diazonium group (-N2+).\n*   vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination reaction).\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound and all steps show high regioselectivity, leading to a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
