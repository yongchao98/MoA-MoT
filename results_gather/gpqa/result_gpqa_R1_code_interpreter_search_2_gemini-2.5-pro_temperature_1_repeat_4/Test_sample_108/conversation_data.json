    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. We can determine its quantum numbers from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   **Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter `S` corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The subscript is `0`, so `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe must apply the following principles to the reaction `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`:\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    `J_i = J_f` (vector sum).\n    Since `J_i = 0`, the total angular momentum of the final products must vectorially sum to zero. The final state consists of the final NN system (with total angular momentum `J_f(NN)`) and particle X. Assuming particle X is a spin-0 meson (like a pion, which has intrinsic parity -1), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `l(X)`.\n    So, `J_f(NN) + l(X) = 0` (vector sum). This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal:\n    `J_f(NN) = l(X)`  **(Rule 1)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    `P_i = P_f`\n    The initial parity `P_i` is +1. The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parities of the final NN system, the intrinsic parity of X, and the parity from the orbital motion of X.\n    `P_f = P(NN final) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^{L_f(NN)} * (-1) * (-1)^{l(X)}`\n    So, the conservation equation is:\n    `+1 = -(-1)^{L_f(NN) + l(X)}`\n    This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f(NN) + l(X)} = -1`, which means the exponent must be an odd number:\n    `L_f(NN) + l(X)` must be odd.  **(Rule 2)**\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem explicitly states a condition for the final NN state derived from the Pauli exclusion principle:\n    `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`. Substituting this into the formula:\n    `0 = S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This requires that `S_f(NN) + L_f(NN)` must be an odd number.  **(Rule 3)**\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nNow we test each of the given reactions against these three rules.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l(X)=1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-cons):** Is `J_f = l(X)`? `1 = 1`. (Yes)\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** Is `L_f + l(X)` odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. (Yes)\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. (Yes)\n*   This reaction is permitted by all three rules. (Note: While a `7D1` state with S=3 is not possible for two nucleons, we adhere strictly to the rules given in the problem, one of which is the Pauli condition provided).\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l(X)=3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-cons):** Is `J_f = l(X)`? `3 = 3`. (Yes)\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** Is `L_f + l(X)` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (Yes)\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (Yes)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l(X)=0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-cons):** Is `J_f = l(X)`? `0 = 0`. (Yes)\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** Is `L_f + l(X)` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Yes)\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (No, this is even)\n*   This reaction violates the Pauli statistics condition given in the problem. Therefore, it is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l(X)=1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-cons):** Is `J_f = l(X)`? `1 = 1`. (Yes)\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** Is `L_f + l(X)` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (Yes)\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Yes)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only reaction that violates the conditions derived from the problem statement is C, as it fails to satisfy the Pauli statistics requirement for the final state.\n\n<<<C>>>"
