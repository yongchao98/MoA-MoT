    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   Butan-2-one (CH3COCH2CH3) is a ketone.\n        *   Sodium cyanide (NaCN) provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. A new C-C bond is formed between the carbonyl carbon and the cyanide carbon, and the carbonyl oxygen is converted to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a classic nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group, known as cyanohydrin formation.\n        1.  The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate: CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2CH3.\n        3.  To form the final stable product, this negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated (i.e., it must accept a proton, H⁺).\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source. Among the given options for A, NaHSO3 is a reagent for bisulfite addition, not cyanohydrin formation. H3O⁺ represents an aqueous acid (like dilute HCl or H2SO4), which is an excellent source of protons to complete the reaction. Therefore, **A = H3O⁺**. This narrows down the choices to C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Transformation:** The key change is the conversion of the nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base in the presence of water and usually requires heating.\n        *   The reaction is shown to produce the carboxylic acid directly, which is typical of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. (Base-catalyzed hydrolysis would first produce a carboxylate salt, which would then need a separate acidification step).\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n        *   Comparing the options for B (HCl and CH3COOH), HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.\n        *   CH3COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough to drive the hydrolysis of a nitrile to completion to form a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for this transformation is a strong acid, making **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H3O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
