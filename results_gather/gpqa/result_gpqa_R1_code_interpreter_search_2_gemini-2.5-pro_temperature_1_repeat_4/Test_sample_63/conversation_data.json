    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup and calculate the moles of products.**\n    The initial mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes. We analyze the change in mass of each tube to identify the products.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This suggests the absence of carbon in the original salts.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ gas, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and verify the conservation of mass.**\n    The total mass of the initial salts was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(O₂) = 0.025 mol * 32 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   The gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that does not react with Cu or Ca(OH)₂ is nitrogen gas (N₂). (Molar mass of N₂ = 2 * 14 = 28 g/mol).\n\n3.  **Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n    The atoms in the original salts A and B must be the same as the atoms in the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂).\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles(H) = 2 * Moles(H₂O) = 2 * 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in H₂O and O₂. Moles(O) = Moles(H₂O) + 2 * Moles(O₂) = 0.20 mol + 2 * 0.025 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles(N) = 2 * Moles(N₂) = 2 * 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n4.  **Identify Salts A and B.**\n    The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts. The elements present are N, H, and O. This strongly suggests ammonium salts with nitrogen-oxygen anions. Let's find the simplest integer ratio of the atoms in the combined mixture of A and B.\n    *   Ratio: H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\n    *   To get integers, we can divide by the smallest number (0.20) and then multiply to clear fractions:\n    *   H : N : O = (0.40/0.20) : (0.20/0.20) : (0.25/0.20) = 2 : 1 : 1.25\n    *   Multiply by 4 to clear the decimal: H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n    *   So, the combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B must be proportional to H₈N₄O₅.\n    *   Let's consider common salts formed from H, N, and O: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   Salt A: **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **, Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n        *   Salt B: **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**, Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n    *   Let's check the sum of their formulas:\n        *   (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅\n    *   This combination (N₄H₈O₅) has an atomic ratio of H:N:O = 8:4:5, which perfectly matches our derived ratio. This confirms the identities of the salts.\n\n5.  **Answer the Question.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one molecule of A plus one molecule of B).\n    *   Number of atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Number of atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
