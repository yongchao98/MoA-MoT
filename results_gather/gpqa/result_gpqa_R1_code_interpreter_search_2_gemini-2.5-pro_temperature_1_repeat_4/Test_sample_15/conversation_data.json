    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which compounds are chiral and are not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key indicators of chirality are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) or center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a C=C double bond, and the atoms connected to these carbons lie in the same plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself contains stereochemical descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`.\n    *   The `R` and `S` descriptors are used to define the absolute configuration of specific chiral centers.\n    *   When a compound is named with specific R/S configurations, it refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric, meaning the groups attached to C2 are the same as the groups attached to C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon).\n    *   This symmetry allows for the existence of a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The (2R,3S) isomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is the meso form. It possesses a center of inversion and is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above.\n    *   The (2R,3R) configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound, which is non-superimposable. These two form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The name specifies the (2R,3R) isomer, which is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   Similar to compound 2, the name includes the `(R)` stereodescriptor. This indicates a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n    *   Let's verify the chirality. The carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, the ring segment -CH2-CH=, and the ring segment -CH2-CH2-CH=. Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is chiral.\n    *   Being named as the (R)-enantiomer, it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cyclohexane with three OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation refers to the stereochemistry. For 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexanes, there are two possible stereoisomers: one where all substituents are *cis* to each other, and one where one is *trans* to the other two.\n    *   The all-cis isomer is highly symmetrical. It has a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry. Due to the planes of symmetry, it is achiral. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is used for this specific achiral (meso-like) isomer.\n    *   The other isomer (one OH trans to the other two) is also achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Since the compound is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group, and two methyl (`-CH3`) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the `C=O`, `CH2`, and `CH` groups, bisecting the two methyl groups and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
