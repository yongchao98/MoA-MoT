    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\n\nThe primary goal is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. To stop the synthesis, we need to inactivate this gene so that it no longer produces a functional protein. The most effective way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that either drastically shortens the protein or completely scrambles its amino acid sequence.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence\n\nThe intact gene starts with `5’-ATG...` and ends with `...TGA-3’`.\n*   `ATG` is the universal start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). Translation of the protein begins here.\n*   `TGA` is one of the three stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). Translation terminates here.\n\nLet's break the beginning of the intact sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides):\n**Intact Gene:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n**Amino Acid Sequence:** `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - ...`\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Mutant and its Effect\n\nWe will now compare each mutant sequence to the intact sequence, grouping them into codons to see the effect on the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n#### Mutant 1\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n*   **Codons:** `ATG TTC TAC GCT ...`\n*   **Comparison to Intact:**\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**; it has no effect on the amino acid sequence.\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** The resulting protein will have one amino acid (Leucine) replaced by another (Tyrosine). While this *could* potentially inactivate the protein, it is not guaranteed. Many single amino acid substitutions have little to no effect on protein function. Therefore, this is not the most reliable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n#### Mutant 2\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n*   **Codons:** `ATG TTC TAA GCT ...`\n*   **Comparison to Intact:**\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. This is the same silent mutation as in Mutant 1.\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), but `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The stop codon will cause translation to terminate prematurely. The resulting \"protein\" will consist of only two amino acids (Met-Phe). Such a severely truncated peptide is virtually certain to be non-functional. This is a highly effective way to knock out gene function.\n\n#### Mutant 3\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparing the length of this sequence snippet to the intact one reveals it is longer. This suggests an **insertion** has occurred. For example, an insertion of a single nucleotide 'T' after the second codon (`ATG TTT`):\n    *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...` -> `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...`\n    *   Mutant: `ATG TTT T CTC GCT GGT...` would be read as `ATG TTT TCT CGC TGG T...` -> `Met - Phe - Ser - Arg - Trp...`\n*   **Effect:** An insertion of a number of bases not divisible by three causes a **frameshift mutation**. This changes the reading frame for all subsequent codons, leading to a completely different and usually meaningless amino acid sequence. This almost always results in a non-functional protein and is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n#### Mutant 4\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparing the length of this sequence snippet to the intact one reveals it is shorter. This suggests a **deletion** has occurred. A deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three also causes a **frameshift mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** Like the insertion in Mutant 3, a frameshift from a deletion would scramble the protein's amino acid sequence, almost certainly rendering it non-functional.\n\n### 4. Conclusion: Which Mutation is Most Probable to Work?\n\nWe have three excellent candidates for eliminating the protein's function:\n*   **Mutant 2 (Nonsense mutation):** Creates a stop codon, truncating the protein.\n*   **Mutant 3 (Frameshift mutation - Insertion):** Scrambles the amino acid sequence.\n*   **Mutant 4 (Frameshift mutation - Deletion):** Scrambles the amino acid sequence.\n\nAll three are highly likely to achieve the goal. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is arguably the most direct and certain \"off switch\". It occurs very early (at the 3rd codon), ensuring that no meaningful protein is produced. While frameshifts are also catastrophic, the nonsense mutation is a definitive stop signal for the cellular machinery. In the context of a multiple-choice question looking for the *most probable* successful outcome, the clean and decisive effect of an early nonsense mutation makes it the strongest choice.\n\nThe change `CTC` -> `TAA` in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon and is the most definitive way presented to ensure the gene product is non-functional.\n\n<<<B>>>"
