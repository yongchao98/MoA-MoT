    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or ring.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH2- group). This confirms a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. Its chemical shift is appropriate for protons alpha to a carbonyl group. The splitting, a doublet (d), confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The upfield shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) indicate the presence of a strong electron-donating group attached to the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2). An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and a -CH2-CHO group as substituents.\n    The structure is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H9NO. This matches.\n\n**Step 2: Follow the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n\n    (H2N)-C6H4-(CH2CHO)\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride\n\n    (Cl- N2+)-C6H4-(CH2CHO)\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O, Heat**\n    The diazonium salt is treated with water and heated. This causes the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group and releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\n\n    (HO)-C6H4-(CH2CHO)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting an aldehyde that has α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate.\n    2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n        *   Aldol Addition Product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This corresponds to option A).\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This results in a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   Aldol Condensation Product: The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n        (HO)-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product from the options.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal is the aldol *addition* product. It is an intermediate that forms before dehydration.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal is incorrect; it is not a dimerization product.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the aldol *condensation* product, formed after dehydration. The \"Heat\" condition strongly favors the formation of this conjugated product over the simple addition product.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal is incorrect as the hydroxyl groups are missing.\n\nThe final product of the entire sequence, under the given conditions, is the dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
