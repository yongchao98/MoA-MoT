    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n1.  **Analyze the core concept:** The density of a planet depends on its mass and its volume (ρ = M/V). For planets made of the same materials (i.e., same composition), the density is not constant. A more massive planet exerts a stronger gravitational force on itself, causing its constituent materials to become more compressed. This phenomenon is known as gravitational compression or self-compression. As a result, for planets of the same composition, density increases with mass.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option based on this principle:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline, which is essentially the planet Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³. This is almost identical to Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet is made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth but is much more massive. Due to the significantly greater mass (5 M_earth), it will experience much stronger gravitational compression. This compression will squeeze the materials into a smaller volume than they would otherwise occupy, leading to a significantly higher average density than Earth's. Based on planetary structure models, its density would be roughly ρ_earth * (5)^(1/4) ≈ 5.51 * 1.5 ≈ 8.3 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is also made of the same materials as Earth but is less massive (0.5 M_earth). With weaker gravity, it will be less compressed than Earth. Therefore, its average density will be lower than Earth's density. Its density would be roughly ρ_earth * (0.5)^(1/4) ≈ 5.51 * 0.84 ≈ 4.6 g/cm³.\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (estimated around 8.3 g/cm³)\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (estimated around 4.6 g/cm³)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The planet described in option (c) has the highest mass among those with Earth-like composition, which results in the greatest gravitational compression and therefore the highest density. Comparing the values, planet (c) is clearly the densest.\n\n<<<C>>>"
