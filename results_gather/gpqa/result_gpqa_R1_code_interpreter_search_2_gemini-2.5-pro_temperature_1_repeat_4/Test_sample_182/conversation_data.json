    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactant and its structure.**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group is the principal functional group, so it is at position 1.\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position 5.\n\n    The structure contains several sources of unsaturation:\n    1.  A ring structure.\n    2.  A carbon-carbon double bond within the ring (C=C).\n    3.  A carbon-oxygen double bond in the carboxylic acid group (C=O).\n    4.  A carbon-oxygen double bond in the formyl group (C=O).\n    5.  A carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group (C=C).\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydriodic acid (HI). This combination is a very strong reducing agent. Its effect is to:\n    *   Reduce aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Reduce any carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) or triple bonds to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The reaction is powerful enough to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups to the corresponding alkane, but it does not break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds of a cyclohexane ring.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\n    Applying the effects of the Red P/HI reagent to the reactant:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is reduced).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) at position 1 is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) at position 2 is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at position 5 is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3).\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated molecule, meaning it contains only single bonds, but it still has a ring structure.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Number of rings:** The product molecule retains the six-membered ring structure from the reactant. So, the number of rings is 1.\n    *   **Number of π bonds:** The reaction with Red P/HI reduces all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. Therefore, the product has zero π bonds.\n\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n    IHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product and use the IHD formula.\n    *   The reactant's carbon skeleton consists of a 6-carbon ring, a 1-carbon carboxylic acid, a 1-carbon formyl group, and a 2-carbon vinyl group, for a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   The product is a fully saturated substituted cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms. A saturated monocyclic alkane has the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n    *   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) 3\nB) 0\nC) 5\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated IHD is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
