    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene, Nitric Acid (HNO3), and Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids generates the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is a powerful electrophile.\n*   **Product 1:** The nitronium ion substitutes a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring to form **Nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\n*   **Reactant:** Nitrobenzene (Product 1).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2) and Iron powder (Fe), which acts as a catalyst by forming the Lewis acid FeBr3 in situ.\n*   **Reaction:** This is another electrophilic aromatic substitution, bromination. The nitro group (-NO2) on the benzene ring is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Therefore, it is a **deactivating** group (making the reaction slower than with benzene) and a **meta-director**. This means the incoming electrophile (Br+) will be directed to the position *meta* (at carbon 3) relative to the nitro group.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is **m-Bromonitrobenzene** (or 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\n*   **Reactant:** m-Bromonitrobenzene (Product 2).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and Palladium on carbon (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This set of reagents is a standard method for the selective reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine group (-NH2) without affecting the C-Br bond.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is **m-Bromoaniline** (or 3-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Diazotization of the Amine**\n*   **Reactant:** m-Bromoaniline (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium Nitrite (NaNO2) and Fluoroboric Acid (HBF4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and H+) to form a diazonium salt. The use of HBF4 as the acid results in the formation of a relatively stable diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is **m-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate**.\n\n**Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction**\n*   **Reactants:** m-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (Product 4) and Anisole (methoxybenzene). The mixture is heated.\n*   **Reaction:** The phrase \"heated and then treated with anisole\" is best interpreted as a one-pot process where the diazonium salt is thermally decomposed in the presence of anisole. This is a **Gomberg-Bachmann reaction**, which forms a new carbon-carbon bond between two aromatic rings (a biaryl). The diazonium salt decomposes to form a nitrogen molecule and a highly reactive **m-bromophenyl radical**.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** This radical then attacks the anisole molecule. The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an electron-donating group and an **ortho, para-director**. The radical attack will therefore occur primarily at the ortho and para positions relative to the methoxy group. Due to steric hindrance, substitution at the **para position** is favored and will yield the major product.\n*   **Final Product 5:** The m-bromophenyl group attaches to the para-position of anisole. The resulting structure is a biphenyl system where one ring has a bromine atom at position 3, and the other ring (the former anisole) has a methoxy group at position 4'.\n*   **Name:** **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - This matches our derived major product.\nB) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. There is no reaction to add fluorine to the anisole ring.\nC) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - This is the minor ortho-product.\nD) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. The initial bromination occurs meta to the nitro group, not para.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the major product from the final step.\n\n<<<A>>>"
