    "This problem is about the relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the uncertainty in its energy, which is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The core principle connecting time and energy is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which can be stated as:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state (also known as the natural linewidth).\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n*   **Calculating Energy Uncertainty:** For practical calculations, we can approximate the relationship as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    This ΔE represents the inherent \"blurriness\" or width of the energy level. A shorter lifetime (τ) leads to a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE), meaning the energy level is broader.\n\n*   **Values Needed:**\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n*   **Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:**\n    *   For state 1:\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   For state 2:\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Condition for Resolvability:** To clearly distinguish, or \"resolve,\" two energy levels, the difference between their central energies (|E1 - E2|) must be significantly larger than their combined energy uncertainties. A common criterion (similar to the Rayleigh criterion in optics) is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (uncertainties).\n    Required Energy Difference > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n*   **Calculate the minimum required energy difference:**\n    Minimum Difference ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2\n    Minimum Difference ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    Minimum Difference ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    Minimum Difference ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Compare with the given options:** We need to find an option that is safely larger than this minimum required difference.\n    A) 10⁻⁸ eV  (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> Not resolvable\n    B) 10⁻⁹ eV  (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> Not resolvable\n    C) 10⁻⁴ eV  (>> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> **Resolvable**\n    D) 10⁻¹¹ eV (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> Not resolvable\n\nThe only energy difference large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state using the uncertainty principle (Delta_E ~ h_bar / tau)\ndelta_E1 = h_bar / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two levels, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties.\nrequired_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (Delta_E1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (Delta_E2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required minimum energy difference for resolution: {required_difference:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Compare with the options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is large enough to be resolved.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT large enough to be resolved.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The question relates the lifetime of a quantum state to its energy. This relationship is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) are related by the inequality:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n2.  **Interpret the terms:**\n    *   **Lifetime (τ):** This is given for both states: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s and τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   **Energy Uncertainty (ΔE):** This represents the \"width\" or \"fuzziness\" of the energy level. A state does not have an infinitely sharp energy value; it has a natural linewidth. A shorter lifetime means the state decays faster, leading to a larger uncertainty (a broader linewidth) in its energy. For practical calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n3.  **State the condition for \"resolving\" the energy levels:** For two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be clearly distinguished or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies (|E₂ - E₁|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths).\n    Condition for resolution: |E₂ - E₁| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units that are convenient for this problem, which are electron-volts (eV) and seconds (s).\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For state 1:**\n        τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For state 2:**\n        τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Calculate the minimum required energy difference:**\n    *   To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their widths.\n    *   Required Difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Required Difference > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Required Difference > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Required Difference > 7.2402 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare the required difference with the given options:**\n    We are looking for an option that is greater than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (This is smaller than the required difference).\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (This is much smaller).\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (This is much larger than the required difference).\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (This is much, much smaller).\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The only energy difference that is large enough to allow the two energy levels to be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV. The other options are smaller than the combined energy uncertainty of the states, meaning the energy levels would overlap and be indistinguishable. The python code execution confirms this calculation precisely.\n\n<<<C>>>"
