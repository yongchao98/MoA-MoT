    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the Role of Gene G2**\n\n*   **Observation:** The single mutant `g2` results in a complete loss of resistance (0%). This is the most severe phenotype observed.\n*   **Observation:** The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance.\n*   **Interpretation:** The phenotype of the `g2` mutation completely masks the phenotypes of the `g1` and `g3` mutations. When `g2` is knocked out, it doesn't matter whether `g1` or `g3` are functional; resistance is zero regardless.\n*   **Genetic Principle:** This phenomenon is called **epistasis**. The gene whose phenotype is expressed (in this case, the `g2` phenotype of 0% resistance) is said to be epistatic to the gene whose phenotype is masked (`g1` or `g3`).\n*   **Biological Conclusion:** In a regulatory pathway, an upstream gene is often epistatic to downstream genes. Since G2's knockout has such a drastic and overriding effect, it is very likely the most upstream gene in this pathway, acting as a master regulator. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor, and this role fits perfectly for an upstream master regulator. Therefore, **G2 is the transcription factor.** This conclusion eliminates option D.\n\n**2. Analyze the Relationship Between Genes G1 and G3**\n\n*   **Observation:**\n    *   `g1` single mutant has 75% resistance (a 25% loss from the wild-type control).\n    *   `g3` single mutant has 50% resistance (a 50% loss from the control).\n    *   `g1g3` double mutant has 10% resistance (a 90% loss from the control).\n*   **Hypothesis (if genes act independently/additively):** If the genes had separate, additive effects on resistance, the expected resistance of the double mutant would be `100% - (loss from g1) - (loss from g3) = 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%`.\n*   **Comparison:** The actual resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant (10%) is significantly lower than the expected additive resistance (25%). The combined loss of function is greater than the sum of the individual losses.\n*   **Genetic Principle:** This \"greater-than-additive\" effect is known as a **synergistic interaction**.\n*   **Biological Conclusion:** A common reason for synergistic interactions is **gene redundancy**. This means that G1 and G3 perform similar or overlapping functions in the resistance pathway (downstream of G2). While the loss of one can be partially compensated for by the other, the loss of both genes causes a near-complete failure of that part of the pathway. Therefore, **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options based on our conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": **Correct.**\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": **Correct.**\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This part is technically incorrect based on the classic definition of epistasis (the double mutant phenotype of 10% is not the same as the single `g1` phenotype of 75%). However, the first two statements are strongly supported.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": **Correct.**\n    *   \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\": This is a possible mechanism but cannot be concluded from the data provided. It is speculation.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": **Correct.**\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\": Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measured one trait (resistance), so we have no evidence for or against pleiotropy.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": Incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOption A contains two conclusions (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\") that are strongly and directly supported by the experimental data. The other options contain speculative or unsupported claims (\"same promoter,\" \"pleiotropy\"). Although the third clause in option A regarding epistasis between G1 and G3 is not a good fit for the classical definition, option A provides the best overall description of the genetic interactions. The key takeaways from the experiment are the upstream regulatory role of G2 and the synergistic/redundant relationship between G1 and G3, both of which are correctly identified in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
