    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Key Details:**\n        *   The peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   The combined integral is 1H, and the individual integrals are roughly equal. This indicates the two species are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is explicitly ruled out.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The presence of two distinct signals for what should be a single proton in a pure compound suggests that there are two different, but very similar, molecular species in the sample. Since the proton is an alpha-proton (a proton on a chiral center in an amino acid), this points towards a stereochemical difference.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two peaks are seen in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n    *   **Key Details:**\n        *   The peaks are clearly defined, even at elevated temperatures.\n        *   They have equal intensities, again suggesting a 1:1 mixture.\n        *   The mass spectrometry (MS) data for *both* peaks is identical and matches the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n    *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   The identical MS data confirms that both species are isomers; they have the same mass, ruling out impurities with different molecular formulas (like precursors or side-products with different structures).\n        *   The fact that they can be separated by chromatography (LC) means they have different physical properties.\n        *   Separation at elevated temperature suggests that the two species are configurationally stable and not simply conformers (like rotamers), which would likely interconvert and coalesce into a single peak at higher temperatures.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Combined Data:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect. A precursor would have a different molecular weight, which would be detected by the MS analysis. The data shows both peaks have the same mass as the final product.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is incorrect. A double-coupled product would have a significantly higher molecular weight due to the addition of an extra amino acid or protecting group. The MS data refutes this.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and spectroscopic properties. They would not produce two separate peaks in a standard 1H NMR spectrum, nor would they separate on a standard (achiral) LC column.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is the correct explanation.\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has at least two chiral centers, and the configuration differs at one or more (but not all) of them. In peptide synthesis, this can happen if an amino acid building block epimerizes (e.g., an L-amino acid partially converts to a D-amino acid) during the reaction.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Diastereoisomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties. Their protons exist in slightly different chemical environments, leading to different chemical shifts in the NMR spectrum. It is expected that the alpha-proton of one diastereomer would have a different chemical shift from the alpha-proton of the other, resulting in two peaks.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by chromatography (LC). This explains the two peaks in the chromatogram. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data. The 1:1 ratio is a common outcome of epimerization at one chiral center.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of two distinct species that are separable by LC but have the same mass, and which show distinct signals in the NMR spectrum, is the classic evidence for the presence of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
