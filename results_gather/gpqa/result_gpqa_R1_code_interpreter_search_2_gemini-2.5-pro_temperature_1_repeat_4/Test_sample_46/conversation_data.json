    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring, likely a carbonyl group (C=O) which accounts for 1 DBE.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is typical for an ester, especially an aromatic ester where conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency from the usual 1735-1750 cm-1.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\nThe spectrum shows signals for 11 protons in total (3+2+2+2+2=11), which matches the molecular formula.\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates this methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester (-O-CH2-). The triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group** (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange. This signal, combined with the IR data, confirms the **primary amine (-NH2)** group attached to the aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons, are a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The amine group (-NH2) is an electron-donating group, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield.\n    *   The ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield.\n    *   Therefore, the doublet at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH2 group.\n    *   The doublet at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure:**\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine group (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options:**\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine, and would not give two N-H bands in the IR. Also, it would have a formyl proton signal (~8.2 ppm) in the NMR.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide, but the C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1650 cm-1). Also, a meta-substituted ring would give a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this isomer, the ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-). The -CH2- protons would be a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl group, NH2 protons, and para-substituted aromatic pattern in the 1H NMR.\n\n<<<D>>>"
