    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The key property of this law for this problem is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived.\n\n2.  **Define the Decay Probability:**\n    Let P(t) be the probability that a single atom decays within a time interval `t`. This is given by the formula:\n    P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n    where:\n    *   `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a characteristic of the specific atom.\n    *   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n    *   `t` is the time interval.\n\n    The probability of the atom *surviving* for a time `t` is S(t) = 1 - P(t) = e^(-λt).\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter:**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    From this, we can find the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n    We don't need to calculate the exact value of `λ` itself. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    Let T be the time of decay. We want to find the conditional probability:\n    P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T < 200 | T > 50)\n\n5.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not affect its future decay probability. The probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    Therefore, the problem simplifies to calculating P(150).\n    P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` using the value we found in step 3 (`e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`).\n    We can write `e^(-λ * 150)` in terms of `e^(-λ * 100)`:\n    e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n    So, e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n    Now, we can calculate this value.\n    (0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * (0.68)^0.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68)\n    Using a calculator, `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n\n    The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n    P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\n    P(150) ≈ 0.4393\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This is closest to option A, 44%.\n\nTo get a more precise value, we can use a small Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32.\n# This means the survival probability for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# S(100) = exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, the probability of decaying\n# in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes, is the same\n# as the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# We need to calculate P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150).\n\n# We can express exp(-lambda * 150) in terms of exp(-lambda * 100):\n# exp(-lambda * 150) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^(150/100) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nsurvival_prob_150 = 0.68 ** 1.5\ndecay_prob_150 = 1 - survival_prob_150\n\nprint(f\"The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: {decay_prob_150 * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n>>>\nprob = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\nprint(f\"{prob=}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated probability is {prob*100:.2f}%\")\n>>>\nprob=0.4392657434770335\nThe calculated probability is 43.93%\n\nThe calculation confirms that the probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem deals with the probability of radioactive decay, which is a classic example of a memoryless process.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the principle of memoryless decay.**\nThe key concept here is that radioactive decay is a Poisson process. The probability of an atom decaying in a given time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. This is known as the \"memoryless\" property. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability. The question is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a newly created atom will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**Step 2: Define the survival and decay probabilities.**\nThe probability of an atom *surviving* for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\nS(t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability of an atom *decaying* within a time `t` is:\nP(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**Step 3: Use the given information to find a key value.**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP(100) = 0.32\nThis means the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes is:\nS(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nSo, we have the relationship: e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the probability for the new time interval.**\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As established in Step 1, this is simply P(150).\nP(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can rewrite e^(-λ * 150) in terms of the value we found in Step 3:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\nSubstituting the value from Step 3:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation.**\nThe calculation from the Python script confirms this:\nSurvival probability for 150 minutes = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\nDecay probability for 150 minutes = P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability, 0.4393, is equal to 43.93%.\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the given options.**\nThe calculated value of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\nA) 44%\nB) 48%\nC) 40%\nD) 52%\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
