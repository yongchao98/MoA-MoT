    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, n=1).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a triplet, n=2).\n    *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (giving a quartet, n=3).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet, n=1).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a triplet, n=2).\n    *   Another group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a second triplet, n=2).\n\nWe must now examine each proposed structure to see which one contains protons with these specific neighboring environments.\n\nLet's first correctly identify the structures from the given condensed formulas. In these formulas, parentheses denote groups attached to the preceding carbon atom.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `COOH-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂(b)-CH₃(a)`\n    -   Proton H(c): Is coupled to H(d) (1H), CH₂(b) (2H), and its attached CH₃ (3H). This gives a **dtq** signal. **(Match for one signal)**\n    -   No proton in this molecule is coupled to one H, two Hs, and another two Hs. Therefore, there is no **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `COOH-CH₂(d)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₃(a)`\n    -   Proton H(c): Is coupled to H(b) (1H), CH₂(d) (2H), and its attached CH₃ (3H). This gives a **dtq** signal. **(Match for one signal)**\n    -   No proton in this molecule is coupled to one H, two Hs, and another two Hs. Therefore, there is no **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `COOH-CH(d)(C₂H₅)-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(b)-CH₃(a)`\n    -   Proton H(c): Is coupled to H(d) (1H), CH₂(b) (2H), and the CH₂ of its attached ethyl group (2H). This gives a **dtt** signal. **(Match for one signal)**\n    -   No proton in this molecule is coupled to one H, two Hs, and three Hs. The other methine proton, H(d), is only coupled to H(c) (1H) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H), giving a doublet of triplets (dt). Therefore, there is no **dtq** signal.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    Let's determine the IUPAC name from the condensed formula: `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    The longest carbon chain containing the COOH group is 6 carbons long (`COOH-CH₂-CH-CH-CH₂-CH₃`), so it is a hexanoic acid derivative. Numbering from the COOH carbon as C1:\n    `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(CH(CH₃)C₂H₅)-...` This parsing is incorrect.\n    Let's re-trace the structure from the condensed formula `CH₃-CH(A)(Et)-CH(B)(Et)-CH₂(C)-COOH(D)`\n    The longest chain containing the COOH is: `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    This hexanoic acid chain has substituents at C3 and C4.\n    - At C3: an ethyl group.\n    - At C4: a methyl group.\n    So the name is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    Let's analyze the key protons in this structure:\n    `CH₃(f)CH₂(e)-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(b)-COOH(a)`\n    -   **Proton H(d):** This methine proton is coupled to:\n        -   H(c) (1H) → doublet\n        -   CH₂(e) (2H) → triplet\n        -   Its own attached CH₃ (3H) → quartet\n        This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. **(Match for the first signal)**\n    -   **Proton H(c):** This methine proton is coupled to:\n        -   H(d) (1H) → doublet\n        -   CH₂(b) (2H) → triplet\n        -   The CH₂ of its attached ethyl group (2H) → triplet\n        This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. **(Match for the second signal)**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to formula B, which is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, possesses protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum. Therefore, this is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
