    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have a solution containing cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻). These ions react to form a series of complexes: [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n\n2.  **Define the Equilibria and Stability Constants:** The formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (βₙ):\n    *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺  ;  β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n    *   Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]  ;  β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n    *   Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻  ;  β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n    *   Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ;  β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n3.  **Express Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n4.  **Express Complex Concentrations in Terms of Free Co²⁺:** We can rearrange the stability constant equations to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n5.  **Formulate the Distribution Coefficient (α):** The fraction (or distribution coefficient, αₙ) of any particular species is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We want to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂], so we need to calculate α₂.\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now, substitute the expressions from steps 3 and 4 into the equation for α₂:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    We can factor out [Co²⁺] from the denominator and cancel it with the [Co²⁺] in the numerator. This shows that the fraction of each species depends only on the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]), not the total metal concentration.\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Value:** Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    To make the calculation clearer, let's calculate the numerator and the denominator separately.\n    *   **Numerator** = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   **Denominator** = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\n        = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\n        = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\n        = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n        = 2.3646\n\n    Now, calculate α₂:\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646\n\n    Let's use a Python script for the final precise calculation.\n```python\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_concentration = 0.1\n\n# Denominator of the fraction alpha\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*scn_concentration + beta2*scn_concentration**2 + beta3*scn_concentration**3 + beta4*scn_concentration**4\n\n# Numerator for the species [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * scn_concentration**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<execute_result>\n16.91618032648228\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the cobalt-containing species in the solution. These are the free Co(II) ion and the various complexes it forms with thiocyanate (SCN⁻):\n*   Free ion: Co²⁺\n*   Complex 1: [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Complex 2: [Co(SCN)₂] (the species of interest)\n*   Complex 3: [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Complex 4: [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt species, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of these individual species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (βₙ):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the equation for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nWe can factor out [Co²⁺]:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving an expression that only depends on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate the value of the numerator and the denominator:\n*   **Numerator:** β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   1 = 1\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution (16.916...).\n\n<<<A>>>"
