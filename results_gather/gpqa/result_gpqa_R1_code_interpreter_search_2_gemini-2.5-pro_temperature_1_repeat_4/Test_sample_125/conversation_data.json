    "*   **Analysis of Reaction I**\n    *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5, with an (S) configuration.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. LAH will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at carbon 3.\n    *   **Products:** The starting molecule is chiral. The reduction of the ketone can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers for the new alcohol group at C3, either (R) or (S). The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n        *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two chiral centers, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction II**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. This creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4.\n    *   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers. With two chiral centers, there are up to 2^2 = 4 possible stereoisomers.\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Let's examine the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n        *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3) and is therefore a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral. (2S, 4R) is the same molecule as (2R, 4S), just flipped over.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the reaction will produce a racemic mixture of the enantiomers, along with the meso compound.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n        *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n*   **Analysis of the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n    The final mixture contains five different compounds: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers from Reaction II.\n\n    1.  **Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n        *   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment, so they **cannot be separated** and will elute as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n        *   Let's count the peaks:\n            *   Products from Rxn I: (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. They will separate into **2 peaks**.\n            *   Products from Rxn II: The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **1 peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different polarity, so it will be a separate **1 peak**. This gives a total of 2 peaks from Reaction II.\n            *   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) are structurally very different and will have different polarities. Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n            *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n    2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n        *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of **all stereoisomers**, including enantiomers.\n        *   Each of the five unique stereoisomers produced will interact differently with the chiral column and will be separated.\n        *   Let's count the peaks:\n            *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n            *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n            *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n            *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n            *   Product 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n            *   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The analysis shows there will be **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
