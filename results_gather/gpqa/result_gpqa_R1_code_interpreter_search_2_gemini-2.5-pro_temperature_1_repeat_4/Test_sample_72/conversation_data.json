    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nIn special relativity, velocities do not simply add or subtract. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. For two objects moving in the same direction (let's say the positive x-direction) with velocities v1 and v2 with respect to a stationary observer, the relative velocity of object 1 with respect to object 2 is given by:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   v1 = 0.6c (velocity of the first astronaut)\n*   v2 = 0.5c (velocity of the second astronaut)\n*   c = speed of light\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `v_rel = 0.14c`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a moving object in special relativity is given by the formula:\n\n`E = γ * m_rest * c^2`\n\nwhere:\n*   `m_rest` is the rest mass of the object.\n*   `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts (`E_total = E1 + E2`).\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Rest mass (m1) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v1) = 0.6c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ1`:\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n`γ1 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n\nNow, calculate `E1`:\n`E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Rest mass (m2) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v2) = 0.5c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ2`:\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 = 1.1547`\n\nNow, calculate `E2`:\n`E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy of the system (E_total):**\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2`\n`E_total = 5.964 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `E_total = 5.96 mc^2`.\n\nTo be more precise, we can use Python for the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm = 1 # We can use m=1 for the coefficient calculation\nc = 1 # We can use c=1 as we are working in units of c and mc^2\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- 1. Calculate Relative Speed ---\n# v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c**2)\nv_rel_numerator = v1 - v2\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - (v1 * v2) / c**2\nv_rel = v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator\n\n# --- 2. Calculate Total Energy ---\n# Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n# Energy E = gamma * m_rest * c^2\n\n# Astronaut 1 Energy\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2 / c**2)\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * c**2\n\n# Astronaut 2 Energy\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2 / c**2)\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * c**2\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\nprint(f\"Relative speed: {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Total energy: {E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> Relative speed: 0.14c\n> Total energy: 5.96mc^2\n\nThe calculations confirm that the relative speed is approximately `0.14c` and the total energy is `5.96 mc^2`.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Based on the provided code output and the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Relative Speed:** The calculated relative speed is `v_rel = 0.14c`.\n2.  **Total Energy:** The calculated total energy of the system is `E_total = 5.96 mc^2`.\n\nThese calculated values match option A. There are no errors in the calculation or the code execution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nv_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\n<<<A>>>"
