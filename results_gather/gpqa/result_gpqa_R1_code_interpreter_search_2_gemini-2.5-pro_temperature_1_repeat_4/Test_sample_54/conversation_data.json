    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Basic Structure**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of all the signals to find the total number of protons in the molecule:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow let's check the number of protons in the possible compounds:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** `CH₃-CH=CH-OCOCH₃`. Total protons = 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** `CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-OCOCH₃`. Total protons = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n\nThis initial analysis immediately eliminates **Cis-butenyl acetate (B)** and **Trans-butenyl acetate (D)**, as they have 10 protons, not 8. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Assign the Signals to the Propenyl Acetate Structure**\n\nLet's consider the structure of propenyl acetate and assign the signals. We can label the protons for clarity:\n`CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-OCOCH₃(d)`\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to the three protons of the acetate methyl group, **H(d)**. These protons have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a singlet. This is a very characteristic chemical shift for an acetate methyl group.\n\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to the three protons of the methyl group attached to the double bond, **H(a)**. These protons are coupled to the single adjacent proton, **H(b)**, which splits the signal into a doublet (d).\n\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton **H(b)**. It is coupled to two different sets of protons:\n    *   It is coupled to the single proton **H(c)**, which splits it into a doublet (d).\n    *   It is coupled to the three protons of the methyl group **H(a)**, which splits it into a quartet (q).\n    *   The combination results in a doublet of quartets (dq). This matches the data.\n\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton **H(c)**. It is attached to the oxygen atom of the acetate group, which is strongly electron-withdrawing, causing its signal to be shifted significantly downfield. It is coupled only to the adjacent proton **H(b)**, splitting it into a doublet (d). The key piece of information here is the coupling constant, `J`.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the double bond is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   **Trans coupling constant (J_trans):** When the two protons are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans), the coupling constant is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis coupling constant (J_cis):** When the two protons are on the same side of the double bond (cis), the coupling constant is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant for the vinylic protons is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of protons and the splitting patterns match the structure of propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the vinylic protons confirms that they are in a trans relationship. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
