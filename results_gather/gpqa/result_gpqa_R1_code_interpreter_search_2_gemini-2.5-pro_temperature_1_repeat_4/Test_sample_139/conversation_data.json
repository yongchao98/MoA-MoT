    "*   **Step 1: Identify Substance X and related compounds.**\n    *   The problem describes a series of chemical reactions and properties involving an unknown Substance X. Let's decipher the clues.\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". This suggests an isotopically labeled compound, like one containing deuterium (D or ²H), a heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 3:** It reacts with liquid Y to release a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine potential simple gases:\n        *   H₂ (¹H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n        *   D₂ (²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p = n). This is a strong candidate and fits with Clue 1.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n        *   HF (¹H¹⁹F): 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n    *   **Clue 7:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\". This points to common laboratory reagents.\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) contains at least 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces the number of oxygens to 2 implies a reduction. For example, reduction of the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohols (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) results in a product with 2 oxygens. This means X is a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Combining these, X is likely a deuterated reducing agent. The most common powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs are LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄**. Its \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, a very common reagent.\n    *   **Clue 2:** \"reacts violently with liquid Y\". LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. So, let's assume Y is a form of water.\n    *   If X (LiAlD₄) reacts with Y, it produces gas W (D₂). The reaction must be:\n        LiAlD₄ + 4 Y -> Li(Y') + Al(Y')₃ + 4 D₂.\n        For the deuterons to form D₂, the protons must come from LiAlD₄ itself. This means Y should not contribute protons (¹H). The most logical candidate for Y is heavy water, **Y = D₂O**.\n        The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂. This reaction is violent and produces D₂ gas (W), which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits all clues so far.\n    *   **Clue 4:** \"a precipitate G forms\". In the reaction above, LiOD is soluble, but aluminum hydroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Clue 4 & 5:** G (Al(OD)₃), when heated, releases B, and B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\" (3.85 °C). Heating aluminum hydroxide produces aluminum oxide and water.\n        2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O.\n        So, **B = D₂O** (heavy water). The melting point of heavy water is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), which is indeed very close to 277 K.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the required cumulative atomic masses.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We will use integer atomic mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H): Mass number = 2\n        *   Lithium (assumed to be the most common isotope, ⁷Li): Mass number = 7\n        *   Aluminum (almost entirely ²⁷Al): Mass number = 27\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (D), with a mass number of 2.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al), with a mass number of 27.\n    *   The question further clarifies the calculation: \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   This means we must account for the stoichiometry in the formula LiAlD₄.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one Al atom. So, the mass contribution is 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are four D atoms. So, the mass contribution is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   The cumulative (summed) mass is the sum of these contributions: 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n*   **Step 3: Final Answer.**\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
