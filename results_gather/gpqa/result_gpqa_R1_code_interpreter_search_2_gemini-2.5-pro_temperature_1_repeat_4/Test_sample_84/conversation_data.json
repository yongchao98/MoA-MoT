    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star and its own properties. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere:\n- T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n- R_star is the star's radius.\n- 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- 'A' is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write out the expressions for each planet:\n- T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)\n- T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)]\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits, a2 / a1.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method in the form of Doppler shifts (Δλ). The maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K) is related to the planet's properties. For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nwhere:\n- M_p is the planet's mass.\n- M_star is the star's mass.\n- 'i' is the orbital inclination.\n- G is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination i ≈ 90°, and therefore sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nLet's solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\nK^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\nK^2 = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nUsing the expression for 'a' derived above:\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]\n\nThe terms G and M_star are constant for both planets and cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n**6. Relate the RV Amplitude (K) to the Doppler Shift (Δλ):**\nThe Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength to the radial velocity:\nΔλ / λ_0 = v_r / c\nThe maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the RV semi-amplitude (K):\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\n\nThe ratio of the RV amplitudes K1 / K2 is:\nK1 / K2 = [c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0)] / [c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0)] = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\n**7. Combine the Ratios:**\nNow substitute the expression for (K1 / K2) back into the equation for (a2 / a1):\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nFinally, substitute this into our temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\n**8. Final Calculation:**\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n- M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n- M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n- Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n- Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the decimal value, we perform the division.\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio\nM_p1 = 7  # Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5  # Earth masses\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# Ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\nratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\n> 실행 결과\n```\n0.5357142857142857\n```\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) in a circular orbit can be expressed as:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a))\nwhere T_star is the star's effective temperature, A is the planet's albedo, R_star is the star's radius, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2), these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a1))] / [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a2))]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2/a1. We can derive 'a' from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and 'i' is the orbital inclination. Since the planets are detected by the transit method, we can assume i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSolving for 'a':\nK^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2/a1:\na2/a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]\na2/a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2/a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) by the formula K = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where c is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength. The ratio K1/K2 is therefore equal to the ratio Δλ_1/Δλ_2.\nK1/K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for a2/a1:\na2/a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nFinally, we substitute this into our temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n- M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n- M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n- Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n- Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nRatio = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nRatio = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nRatio = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
