    "E_NOT_EXE\nI have found the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral (trigonal) crystal system. The formula is:\n\n$1/d_{hkl}^2 = [ (h^2+k^2+l^2)sin^2(α) + 2(hk+kl+hl)(cos^2(α) - cos(α)) ] / [ a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α)) ]$\n\nWhere:\n- d_hkl is the interplanar distance for the (hkl) plane.\n- a is the lattice parameter.\n- α is the inter-axial angle.\n- h, k, l are the Miller indices of the plane.\n\nGiven values:\n- a = 10 Angstrom\n- α = 30°\n- (hkl) = (111)\n\nLet's plug these values into the formula.\nh = 1, k = 1, l = 1\n\nFirst, let's calculate the terms involving h, k, l:\n- h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3\n- hk + kl + hl = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nNow, let's calculate the trigonometric terms:\n- α = 30°\n- sin(α) = sin(30°) = 0.5\n- cos(α) = cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866\n- sin^2(α) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n- cos^2(α) = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75\n- cos^3(α) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = 3*sqrt(3)/8 ≈ 0.6495\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator of the formula:\nNumerator = [ (3) * (0.25) + 2 * (3) * (0.75 - 0.866) ]\nNumerator = [ 0.75 + 6 * (-0.116) ]\nNumerator = [ 0.75 - 0.696 ]\nNumerator = 0.054\n\nNow, let's calculate the denominator of the formula:\nDenominator = a^2 * [ 1 - 3*cos^2(α) + 2*cos^3(α) ]\nDenominator = (10)^2 * [ 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) ]\nDenominator = 100 * [ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ]\nDenominator = 100 * [ -1.25 + 1.299 ]\nDenominator = 100 * [ 0.049 ]\nDenominator = 4.9\n\nNow, let's calculate 1/d^2:\n1/d^2 = Numerator / Denominator\n1/d^2 = 0.054 / 4.9\n1/d^2 ≈ 0.01102\n\nNow, let's calculate d^2:\nd^2 = 1 / 0.01102\nd^2 ≈ 90.74\n\nFinally, let's calculate d:\nd = sqrt(90.74)\nd ≈ 9.525 Angstrom\n\nThis value is very close to option D.
