    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as a base.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The ketone will be deprotonated to form an enolate (the Michael donor), which will then attack the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Reactants Analysis:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C-2 and C-6.\n        *   C-2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-protons.\n        *   C-6 has a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n\n3.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Enolate Formation:** Since the only available α-proton is at the C-6 position, the base t-BuOK must deprotonate C-6. This forms a single possible enolate, with the double bond between C-1 and C-6.\n    *   **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic C-6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group). The reaction proceeds as follows:\n        1.  The C-6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon (CH₂) of ethyl acrylate.\n        2.  The π-electrons of the C=C bond in ethyl acrylate shift to the α-carbon, forming an enolate anion intermediate.\n        3.  This intermediate is protonated (likely by t-butanol, formed from the base and any trace water) to give the final product.\n    *   **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the original ethyl acrylate. The added chain is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. The final product has the following structure: The cyclohexanone ring has the carbonyl at C-1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C-2, and at C-6, it now has the original methyl group and the newly added `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group.\n\n4.  **Product Naming (Product A):**\n    *   The question provides IUPAC names where the propanoate chain is the parent and the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The added group is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`, so the cyclohexyl ring is attached to C-3 of the ethyl propanoate. The name is `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   Now, we need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules for naming substituents, the carbon atom attached to the parent chain is numbered C-1.\n        *   The point of attachment is our original C-6. So, **new C-1 is old C-6**.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (old C-1) is adjacent, so it becomes **new C-2**.\n        *   The quaternary carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (old C-2) becomes **new C-3**.\n    *   Let's place the substituents according to this new numbering:\n        *   At **new C-1**: The methyl group that was originally on C-6.\n        *   At **new C-2**: The carbonyl group (=O), named as \"oxo\".\n        *   At **new C-3**: The ethyl and methyl groups that were originally on C-2.\n    *   Combining these, the name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. The nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Reactants Analysis:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group (C-1) are acidic. The base KOH will deprotonate this carbon to form a nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂CH(-)-NO₂`), which is a potent nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile). The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-CN. The β-carbon (relative to the electron-withdrawing CN group) is the electrophilic site. The carbons are numbered `CH₃(4)-CH(3)=CH(2)-CN(1)`. The β-carbon is C-3.\n\n3.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Anion Formation:** KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane: `CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂ + H₂O`.\n    *   **Michael Addition:** The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon (C-3) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   **Product Structure:** A new C-C bond forms between C-1 of the nitropropane and C-3 of the butenenitrile. The resulting structure is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n4.  **Product Naming (Product B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent name ends in \"-nitrile\".\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent alkane is hexane. The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now, we identify and number the substituents:\n        *   A methyl group at C-3.\n        *   A nitro group at C-4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents gives the full name: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThe calculated product names match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
