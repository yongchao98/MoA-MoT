    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).\n\n1.  **Identify the components and their roles:**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   In water, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   In water, Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2 H2O.\n    *   The species H2PO4- and HPO4^2- form a conjugate acid-base pair, which acts as a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   **For KH2PO4 (the acid, H2PO4-):**\n        *   Mass = 1.00 g\n        *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n        *   Concentration [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   **For Na2HPO4●2H2O (the base, HPO4^2-):**\n        *   Mass = 1.00 g\n        *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n        *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n        *   Concentration [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] of the buffer solution:**\n    *   The buffer system is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka2 * [H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻):**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4²⁻):\n        HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4³⁻]:\n        [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺]\n    *   Now, we use the concentrations we've already calculated:\n        *   Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n        *   [HPO4²⁻] ≈ 0.02809 M (We assume this concentration is not significantly changed by the very small third dissociation).\n        *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        [PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809) / (8.11x10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's perform the calculation with a higher precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # L\n\n# Ka values\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate moles\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume\n\n# Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4_2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Calculate [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>6.24e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>",
