    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The problem states that the planets are detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method measures the periodic Doppler shift of light from the host star. The wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, along the line of sight:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    The problem gives the *amplitude* of the periodic wavelength shift (e.g., \"up to 5 miliangstrom\"). This amplitude, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, which is denoted as $K_{star}$.\n    Therefore, $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Stellar Velocities:** We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    -   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n    -   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n    The ratio of the stellar radial velocity amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K_{star}$) for a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K_{star} = \\frac{2\\pi a_{star}}{P} \\sin(i)$\n    where $a_{star}$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the system's center of mass, $P$ is the orbital period, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n4.  **Incorporate Center of Mass and Kepler's Third Law:**\n    -   From the definition of the center of mass: $M_{star} a_{star} = m_{planet} a_{planet}$. Since the mass of the star is much greater than the mass of the planet ($M_{star} \\gg m_{planet}$), the planet's orbit semi-major axis $a_{planet}$ is approximately equal to the system's semi-major axis $a$. So, $a_{star} \\approx a \\frac{m_{planet}}{M_{star}}$.\n    -   Substituting this into the equation for $K_{star}$:\n        $K_{star} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi a}{P} \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}}$\n    -   Kepler's Third Law relates the semi-major axis $a$ and the period $P$:\n        $P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G(M_{star} + m_{planet})}$\n        Again, since $M_{star} \\gg m_{planet}$, we can approximate $M_{star} + m_{planet} \\approx M_{star}$.\n        $a^3 \\approx \\frac{G M_{star} P^2}{4\\pi^2} \\implies a \\approx \\left(\\frac{G M_{star} P^2}{4\\pi^2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    -   Now, substitute this expression for $a$ back into the equation for $K_{star}$:\n        $K_{star} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{P} \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\left(\\frac{G M_{star} P^2}{4\\pi^2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    -   Simplifying this expression gives the relationship between $K_{star}$ and $P$:\n        $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\n5.  **Apply the Specifics of the Problem:** The problem states:\n    -   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    -   The planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\". In the RV method, the quantity that is actually determined is the minimum mass, $m_{planet} \\sin(i)$. It is standard to assume that \"detected mass\" refers to this value. Therefore, we assume $m_{planet1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{planet2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    With these factors being the same for both systems, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $K_{star} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}}\\right)^3$\n\n    Now, substitute the known values:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n    Performing the division gives approximately 0.3644. This value corresponds to option B.\n\nTo be certain of the calculation, I will use the code interpreter.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods P2/P1.\n# The ratio of radial velocity amplitudes K2/K1 is 7/5.\n# The relationship is K is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n# So, P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^(-3) = (K1/K2)^3.\n\nratio_K = 7 / 5\nratio_P = (1/ratio_K)**3\n\nprint(ratio_P)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.36443249371820804\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.36, which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning and thinking process has already been established.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The key relationship is how the amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K_{star}$) depends on the system's parameters, particularly the orbital period ($P$).\n\n2.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The observable is the wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   The radial velocity amplitude $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n        $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstroms}}{5 \\text{ miliangstroms}} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **Derive the Relationship between K_star and P:**\n    *   The formula for the radial velocity amplitude is $K_{star} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi a}{P} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}}$, where $a$ is the planet's orbital semi-major axis, $P$ is the period, $m_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{star}$ is the star mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_{star}}$. We can rearrange this to find $a$: $a \\propto (M_{star} P^2)^{1/3}$.\n    *   Substitute the expression for $a$ into the formula for $K_{star}$:\n        $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{(M_{star} P^2)^{1/3}}{P} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}}$\n        $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{M_{star}^{1/3} P^{2/3}}{P} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}}$\n        $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\n4.  **Apply Problem-Specific Conditions:**\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin(i)$. The problem implies we should treat this quantity as equal for both planets ($m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$).\n    *   With these factors being constant, the relationship simplifies to: $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K_{star} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Periods:**\n    *   We can write the relationship as a ratio:\n        $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's solve for it:\n        $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}}\\right)^3$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}}\\right)^3$\n    *   Substitute the known velocity ratio:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   $\\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n    *   This value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
