    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n,l,m> = |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0>. This decay occurs via two electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means it is a two-step cascade process involving an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Transition Selection Rules:** Electric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn can be any integer, but for decay (emission), n must decrease.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>.\n    *   **First Transition:** |3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>\n        *   Initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n        *   Initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm=0,±1, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so n' < 3.\n    *   **Second Transition:** |n',l',m'> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Final state has l=0. Since the intermediate state has l'=1, the rule Δl=±1 is satisfied (Δl = 0 - 1 = -1).\n        *   Final state has m=0. For the transition to be possible, Δm = 0 - m' must be 0, ±1. This condition is met for m' = 0, +1, and -1.\n        *   The principal quantum number must decrease from the intermediate state to the final state, so n' > 1.\n\n    *   **Combining the conditions:** The intermediate state must have n' between 1 and 3, so n'=2. It must have l'=1. And m' can be -1, 0, or 1. Thus, there are three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. This leads to three possible decay routes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for that particular decay channel.\n    *   The total process is a cascade: |3s> → |2p> → |1s>. The probability of a particular route, say through |2,1,m'>, is the product of the probability of the first step and the probability of the second step.\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** The intermediate state is a |2p> state. The only allowed E1 decay from the 2p state is to the 1s state. Therefore, once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'> states, it will decay to |1,0,0> with a probability of 1.\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** We need to find the probability that the initial |3,0,0> state decays into a specific intermediate state, say |2,1,0>, out of the three possibilities.\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0> (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields (as is standard in such problems unless stated otherwise), there is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   Because of this symmetry, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the 2p state. The transition rates Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) are identical for m' = -1, 0, and +1.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes, and they are the only ones possible for the first step, the probability of decaying into any *one* of them is 1/3.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The overall probability for the cascade to proceed through any single, specific intermediate state |2,1,m'> is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: P(route via m') = P(|3s>→|2p,m'>) × P(|2p,m'>→|1s>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3. This option presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n    *   B) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) >→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that is fully consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n<<<A>>>"
