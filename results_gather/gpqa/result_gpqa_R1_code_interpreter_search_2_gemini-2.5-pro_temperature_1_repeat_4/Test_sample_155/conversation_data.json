    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactions**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step reaction sequence performed on two different starting materials.\n*   **Step 1:** Treatment with mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid). This reaction converts an alkene into an epoxide. This is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to one face of the double bond, and the stereochemistry of the starting alkene is preserved in the epoxide.\n*   **Step 2:** Treatment with aqueous acid (H3O+). This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. A water molecule acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the epoxide ring. This results in an **anti-addition** of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the carbon-carbon bond that was originally part of the epoxide.\n\nThe overall transformation (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is an **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene. The stereochemical outcome of this reaction depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n**2. Determine the Products of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two groups to an (E)-alkene results in a **meso** compound.\n    *   *Visualization:* Imagine the two -OH groups adding from opposite sides to the *trans*-alkene. The resulting molecule, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry in certain conformations, making it a single, achiral, meso compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Determine the Products of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two groups to a (Z)-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   *Visualization:* Imagine the two -OH groups adding from opposite sides to the *cis*-alkene. This process can happen in two equally probable ways, leading to two products that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Products of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**4. Analyze the Final Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso (4R,5S) diol is a **diastereomer** to both the (4R,5R) diol and the (4S,5S) diol.\n\n**5. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nNow, we predict the number of peaks observed when this three-component mixture is analyzed by two different types of HPLC.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated, eluting at different times.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the meso compound will produce one peak, and the racemic mixture of enantiomers will produce a second peak.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   In a chiral environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Diastereomers are also separated by this technique.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved from each other. The meso compound will have its own retention time, and the two enantiomers will be separated from each other and from the meso compound.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
