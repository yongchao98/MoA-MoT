    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on a described experiment. Let's break down the key observations from the experiment:\n\n1.  **Antigen delivery:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (antigens) are delivered orally. This mimics a natural infection route for gut pathogens.\n2.  **Antigen destination:** The antigens reach the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut responsible for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n3.  **Cellular activity:** In the Peyer's patches, a cell population is proliferating. This indicates an active immune response, specifically clonal expansion of lymphocytes that recognize the antigen.\n4.  **Genetic observation:** The variable heavy chain genes of these proliferating cells show \"high variability\". The variable heavy chain is part of the B cell receptor (and the subsequent antibody) that binds to the antigen.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options in the context of these observations:\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process alters the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. It switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG) to change its effector function. While this process likely occurs during this immune response, it does not explain the high variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps clear pathogens. It is not a process that generates genetic diversity in lymphocytes.\n\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It intentionally introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different antigen receptors. Through a process of selection called affinity maturation, B cells with mutations that improve binding to the antigen are selected to proliferate. This process is the direct cause of the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating B cell population after antigen exposure. This perfectly matches the experimental observation.\n\n*   **D) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B cell and T cell receptors. It occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) during the development of the lymphocyte, *before* it ever encounters an antigen. The variability described in the question is being generated *during* an active immune response in a secondary lymphoid organ, not during initial lymphocyte development.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population within a Peyer's patch following antigen stimulation is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
