    "*   **Analysis of Compound X**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   The broad peak at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a benzene ring.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**).\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals define the structure of the alkyl substituent.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This points to an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the methyl group (3H) and another proton.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached directly to the benzene ring (a benzylic position, hence the downfield shift) and is coupled to the protons of the two adjacent methyl and methylene groups.\n        *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n            *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with a -COOH group and an alkyl group.\n            *   The alkyl group has a central methine (CH) carbon attached to the ring. This CH is also bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃, from the 1.4 ppm doublet) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃, from the 1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm signals).\n            *   This arrangement forms a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring to a methyl group (-CH₃). Alkyl groups on the ring are stable and do not react under these conditions.\n    3.  **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Reaction: The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   Product: The sec-butyl group at position 1 remains unchanged, and the carboxylic acid at position 4 becomes a methyl group. The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    *   Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The reaction with Red P / HI reduces the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group.\n    *   The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
