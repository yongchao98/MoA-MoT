    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial solution of acetic acid is diluted by adding an equal volume of water. We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n*   M1 (initial concentration) = 0.05 M\n*   V1 (initial volume) = 20.00 cm³\n*   V2 (final volume) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   M2 (final concentration) = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means the solution contains 75% HA and 25% A⁻. This is a buffer solution, and its pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of percentages.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(25% / 75%)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.253\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (A⁻), which is a weak base:\nA⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n\n*   First, determine the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n    *   Initial moles of acid = Concentration * Volume = 0.025 M * 0.0400 L = 0.00100 mol.\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of acetate = 0.00100 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH needed = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume at equivalence point = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M.\n\n*   Next, calculate the concentration of OH⁻ produced by hydrolysis. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   For the hydrolysis reaction, Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]. Let [OH⁻] = x.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x). Assuming x is very small compared to 0.020, we can simplify:\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.020 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n*   Finally, calculate pOH and then pH.\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nTo confirm the calculations precisely, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Values ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid_before_dilution = 0.05\ninitial_vol_acid = 20.00\nvol_water_added = 20.00\nconc_NaOH = 0.1\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\nfinal_vol_acid = initial_vol_acid + vol_water_added\nconc_acid_diluted = (initial_conc_acid_before_dilution * initial_vol_acid) / final_vol_acid\ninitial_moles_acid = conc_acid_diluted * (final_vol_acid / 1000) # in Liters\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point\nvol_NaOH_equiv = (initial_moles_acid / conc_NaOH) * 1000 # in cm3\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_equiv = final_vol_acid + vol_NaOH_equiv\n# Concentration of acetate at equivalence point\nconc_acetate = initial_moles_acid / (total_vol_equiv / 1000) # in Liters\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [Acetate]\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [Acetate])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_equiv = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH_equiv\n\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's the detailed reasoning behind the solution:\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid:** First, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n    *   M₁ (initial concentration) = 0.05 M\n    *   V₁ (initial volume) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V₂ (final volume) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ (final concentration) = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**.\n    *   This is the starting concentration of acetic acid for the titration.\n\n2.  **Buffer Region Calculation:** At 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (acetic acid, HA) has reacted with the strong base (NaOH) to form its conjugate base (acetate, A⁻). This means the solution contains 75% unreacted acetic acid and 25% acetate. This mixture constitutes a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n3.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.732\n\n4.  **Calculate pH:**\n    *   The ratio of the concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their mole fractions, which is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.732 + log(1/3) = 4.732 - 0.477 = 4.255\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the **pH at 25% titration is 4.26**.\n\n**Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Moles of Acid:** At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. We first find the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (in Liters)\n    *   Moles = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = **0.001 mol of acetic acid**.\n\n2.  **Volume of NaOH Added:** We calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize 0.001 mol of acid.\n    *   Volume = Moles / Molarity\n    *   Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = **10.00 cm³ of NaOH**.\n\n3.  **Concentration of Acetate:** At the equivalence point, the solution contains 0.001 mol of the conjugate base (acetate, A⁻) in a new total volume.\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak base:\n    *   A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n\n5.  **Calculate [OH⁻]:** We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] ≈ x² / [A⁻]\n    *   x² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02) = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n6.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n    *   The **pH at the equivalence point is 8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
