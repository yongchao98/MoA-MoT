    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Geometry:**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon aperture where all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the perpendicular distance from the center to a side. The problem states that N becomes infinitely large (N -> ∞).\n    As the number of sides of a regular polygon approaches infinity, the polygon's shape approaches that of a circle. In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Recall Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    When monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern in the far-field known as the Airy pattern. The intensity distribution of this pattern is described by a Bessel function. The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are given by the formula:\n    sin(θ) = (x * λ) / (2 * π * a)\n    where:\n    *   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n    *   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   x represents the non-zero roots (zeros) of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n3.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation:**\n    The problem states that we can assume the angles are small. For small angles, sin(θ) ≈ θ. The formula for the minima simplifies to:\n    θ_n = (x_n * λ) / (2 * π * a)\n    where θ_n is the angular position of the n-th minimum, and x_n is the n-th non-zero root of J₁(x).\n\n4.  **Identify the Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    To find the angular distance between the first two minima, we first need to find their individual angular positions.\n    *   **First Minimum (n=1):** This corresponds to the first non-zero root of J₁(x), which is x₁ ≈ 3.8317.\n        θ₁ = (x₁ / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) = (3.8317 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a).\n    *   **Second Minimum (n=2):** This corresponds to the second non-zero root of J₁(x), which is x₂ ≈ 7.0156.\n        θ₂ = (x₂ / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) = (7.0156 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    The question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [ (x₂ / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ] - [ (x₁ / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ]\n    Δθ = ( (x₂ - x₁) / (2 * π) ) * (λ / a)\n\n6.  **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    Now, we substitute the values of the Bessel function roots and π to find the numerical coefficient. We can use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1(x).\nx1 = 3.83170597\nx2 = 7.01558667\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is given by:\n# delta_theta = ( (x2 - x1) / (2 * pi) ) * (lambda / a)\n# We need to calculate the coefficient C = (x2 - x1) / (2 * pi).\n\ncoefficient = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.5067280315891334\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that the coefficient is approximately 0.5067. Therefore, the angular distance is:\nΔθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 1.220 λ /a\n    *   B) 0.500 λ / a\n    *   C) 0.610 λ / a\n    *   D) 0.506 λ / a\n\nOur calculated value of 0.5067 λ/a is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An N-sided polygon with an infinitely large number of sides (N -> ∞) and a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a'. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe intensity minima in the far-field diffraction pattern of a circular aperture (the Airy pattern) are located at angles θ given by the formula:\nsin(θ_n) = (x_n * λ) / (2 * π * a)\n\nwhere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   x_n are the non-zero roots of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ.
