    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy's reference frame be S. This is considered the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta's reference frame be S'. This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60 000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed is measured in the ejecta's reference frame (S'), so this is the proper time: `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300 000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame (S) is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the time interval measured in the moving frame (`Δt'`). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Combine the Formulas:**\n    *   By substituting the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula, we get:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt')`\n        `d = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt'`\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60 000 km/s / 300 000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate `β²`:\n        `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d`:\n        `d = 60 000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `d = (60 000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3 000 000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   To get the numerical value, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s (proper time in ejecta's frame)\nc = 300000 # km/s (speed of light, standard approximation)\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate beta squared\nbeta_squared = beta**2\n\n# Calculate gamma (Lorentz factor)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# The time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (dilated time)\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(distance_galaxy)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.178478365\n>>>\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Let's compare this to the given options:\n        A) 2 940 000 km\n        B) 3 060 000 km\n        C) 3 000 000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer: `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\n        D) 2 880 000 km\n    *   The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to option B, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is due to the rounding of the value in the option.\n\n<<<B>>>",
