    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The correct physical law to use is the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy states (let's say an excited state 'j' and the ground state 'i') to the temperature (T) of the system.\n\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in the excited state and ground state, respectively.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two states.\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to each star:**\n    Let T_1 be the temperature of star_1 and T_2 be the temperature of star_2. The ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms for each star is:\n\n    *   For star_1:  (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2:  (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    Note that the energy difference `ΔE` and the statistical weights `g_j`, `g_i` are the same for the iron atoms in both stars, as it's the same atomic transition being observed.\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited ... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means the ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:**\n\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, (g_j / g_i), cancels out from both sides.\n\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Isolate the temperatures by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(e^x) = x and ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b), we get:\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2):**\n\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Factor out the common term `ΔE / k` and simplify the expression in the parentheses:**\n\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n10. **Use the numerical values provided:** The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value back into our equation:\n\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n11. **Compare the result with the given options:** The derived equation `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
