    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the core of the question:** The question asks about the fundamental symmetries that *must* be respected by the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). This means we need to identify the foundational assumptions upon which SMEFT is built, as opposed to accidental or approximate symmetries.\n\n2.  **Define SMEFT:** SMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM). It does so by adding higher-dimensional operators, constructed from the SM fields, to the SM Lagrangian. These operators respect the gauge symmetries of the SM (SU(3)c x SU(2)L x U(1)Y). The framework assumes that any new physics appears at a much higher energy scale (Λ) and its low-energy effects can be systematically parameterized by these operators, suppressed by powers of 1/Λ.\n\n3.  **Evaluate each symmetry option:**\n\n    *   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** Lorentz invariance is a cornerstone of modern physics, particularly special relativity and quantum field theory (QFT). It dictates that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. Quantum field theories like the SM and SMEFT are constructed from fields that transform in specific ways under the Lorentz group. The Lagrangian density is constructed to be a Lorentz scalar, ensuring the equations of motion are covariant. Standard SMEFT is, by construction, a Lorentz-invariant theory. Violating it would require a different framework (often called the Standard-Model Extension, which is not the same as SMEFT). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry **must be respected**.\n\n    *   **2. Poincaré Symmetry:** Poincaré symmetry is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. It includes Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) plus spacetime translations (invariance under shifts in space and time). Like Lorentz symmetry, this is a foundational assumption of the QFT framework used to build SMEFT. The invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry **must be respected**.\n\n    *   **3. CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is well-established experimentally that the weak interactions of the Standard Model violate CP symmetry (e.g., in the decay of neutral kaons and B mesons). Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it naturally incorporates the SM's CP violation. Furthermore, many of the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce *new* sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry of SMEFT.\n\n    *   **4. CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a profound result in local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. It states that any theory that is local, Lorentz-invariant, and has a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of C, P, and Time Reversal (T). Since the standard construction of SMEFT is as a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it automatically respects CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of one of its core assumptions, most likely Lorentz invariance. Therefore, CPT symmetry **must be respected**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the conclusions:**\n    *   Symmetry 1 (Lorentz) is required.\n    *   Symmetry 2 (Poincaré) is required.\n    *   Symmetry 3 (CP) is not required.\n    *   Symmetry 4 (CPT) is required.\n\n5.  **Match with the provided options:** The symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option B.\n\n    *   A) 3,4 - Incorrect because it includes the optional symmetry CP (3).\n    *   B) 1,2,4 - Correct.\n    *   C) 1,2 - Incorrect because it omits the required symmetry CPT (4).\n    *   D) 1,3,4 - Incorrect because it includes the optional symmetry CP (3).\n\n<<<B>>>"
