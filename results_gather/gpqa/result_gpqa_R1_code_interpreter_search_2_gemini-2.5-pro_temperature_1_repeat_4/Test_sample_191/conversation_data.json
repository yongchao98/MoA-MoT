    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We begin with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero. It has a spherical cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons within the conductor to redistribute. This process is called electrostatic induction.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` will attract the free electrons in the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. This results in an induced charge of `-q` on the inner surface of the cavity. This must be exactly `-q` to satisfy Gauss's law for a surface just inside the conductor material, where the electric field must be zero.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, a corresponding charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. As charges in a conductor reside on its surface in electrostatic equilibrium, this `+q` charge will spread out over the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface of a conductor are shielded from the electric fields of any charges located inside a cavity within it. This is because the net electric field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero. The field from the charge `+q` in the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface exactly cancels out within the conducting material.\n    *   Because the `+q` charge on the outer surface is shielded from the charges inside, it experiences no net force from them.\n    *   In the absence of any other *external* electric fields, the `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself in the lowest energy configuration, which for a sphere is a *uniform distribution*.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** We need to find the electric field `E` at point P, which is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n    *   The point charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n6.  **Applying the Shell Theorem (and shielding):**\n    *   The combination of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface produces zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity. A more direct way to think about this is through the shielding principle mentioned above.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *solely* by the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   As established in step 4, the charge `+q` is distributed uniformly over the outer spherical surface of radius `R`.\n    *   According to the shell theorem, for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance of the point P from the center O is given as `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The other parameters given in the problem, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its position `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding. They are included to test the understanding of this concept.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, ignores the conductor)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, matches our derivation)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distance that is irrelevant)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex distance that is irrelevant)\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
