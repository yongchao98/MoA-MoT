    "*   **Analysis of the Experiment:**\n    *   **Organism:** *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (yeast).\n    *   **Phenomenon:** The yeast is forming a \"shmoo,\" which is the characteristic cellular response to mating pheromone. This process involves arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase and initiating a specific gene expression program to prepare for mating.\n    *   **Technique:** Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry.\n    *   **Goal:** To identify the proteome (the set of proteins) associated with *active chromatin*. Active chromatin refers to the regions of the genome that are being actively transcribed into RNA.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Protein Complexes:**\n    *   **A) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** This complex, including RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors, assembles at the promoters of genes to start transcription. Since the shmoo response requires the transcription of many specific genes (e.g., those for cell fusion), the PIC will be abundant on the active chromatin of these genes. We would expect to find a lot of these proteins.\n    *   **B) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA sequences bound by activator proteins (transcription factors) to boost gene transcription. In the shmoo response, the transcription factor Ste12 binds to Pheromone Response Elements (PREs) to activate mating-specific genes. These complexes are a hallmark of the active chromatin being studied. We would expect to find a lot of these proteins.\n    *   **C) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes (made of histone proteins) are the fundamental structural unit of all chromatin, both active and inactive. Active chromatin is characterized by specific post-translational modifications on these histones (e.g., acetylation). Any experiment that pulls down chromatin will inevitably pull down a large quantity of histones. Therefore, we would expect to find a lot of these proteins.\n    *   **D) Pre-replication complex (PRC):** The PRC assembles at origins of replication during the G1 phase. Its function is to \"license\" these origins so that DNA replication can begin when the cell enters S phase. However, the shmoo response involves a cell cycle *arrest* in G1, meaning the cell *does not* proceed into S phase and does not replicate its DNA. While PRCs are assembled in G1, their function is related to replication, not transcription. The experiment is designed to recover proteins from transcriptionally active regions, not from origins of replication (which are distinct locations). Therefore, compared to the complexes directly involved in transcription, the PRC proteins would be the least represented in a sample enriched for active chromatin.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The pre-initiation complex, enhancer complexes, and histones are all integral components of transcriptionally active chromatin, which is the target of the experiment. The pre-replication complex is associated with a different process (DNA replication) that is halted during the shmoo response. Therefore, it is the complex that will be least observed in the assay.\n\n<<<D>>>"
