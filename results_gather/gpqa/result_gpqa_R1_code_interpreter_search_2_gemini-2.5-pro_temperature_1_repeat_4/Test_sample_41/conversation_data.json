    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit around a star is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    - T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    - R_star is the star's radius.\n    - a is the semi-major axis (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    - A is the planet's albedo.\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem also states that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2) or T_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\n    This implies that the ratio of the semi-major axes of two planets (say, planet i and planet j) is related to the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures by:\n    a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratios of the orbital distances.**\n    We are given the following temperature ratios:\n    - T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n    - T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n    Using the relationship from step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n    - a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 = 1.4^2 = 1.96\n    - a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29\n\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (a3 / a1), we can multiply the two ratios we just found:\n    a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law.**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit.\n    P^2 ∝ a^3\n\n    This holds true for all planets orbiting the same star, assuming the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass. The information about the planets' masses is likely extraneous, as it is a common simplification in such problems unless the star's mass is also provided.\n\n    From Kepler's Third Law, we can write the relationship for the ratio of the periods of two planets (i and j):\n    (P_j / P_i)^2 = (a_j / a_i)^3\n    P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2)\n\n4.  **Calculate the final ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    We need to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1). Using the formula from step 3 and the value of a3 / a1 calculated in step 2:\n    P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\n    To compute this value, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes a3/a1 was calculated as 10.3684\na3_a1 = 10.3684\n\n# According to Kepler's Third Law, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)\nP3_P1 = a3_a1**(1.5)\n\nprint(P3_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.3842183204944\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 33.38, which is very close to 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An equilibrium temperature of an exoplanet ($T_{eq}$) is related to its orbital distance ($a$) by the following proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nThis means that the ratio of the orbital distances of two planets is inversely proportional to the square of the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}})^2$\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n$\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\nUsing these, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$), we multiply the individual ratios:\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\nThis can be written as a ratio for two planets:\n$(\\frac{P_3}{P_1})^2 = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^3$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^{3/2}$\n\nNow, we substitute the value for the ratio of the orbital distances:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{1.5} \\approx 33.386$\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information about the planets' masses and the specific albedo value is not needed for this calculation, as we are dealing with ratios and the planets orbit the same star.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
