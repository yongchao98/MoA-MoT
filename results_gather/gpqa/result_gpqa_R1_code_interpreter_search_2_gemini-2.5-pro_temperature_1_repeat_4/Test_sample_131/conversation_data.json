    "This problem requires us to determine which pair of compounds, from the given options, would produce the described 1H NMR spectrum when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two C10H14 isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound:**\n\nFirst, we'll check the molecular formula C10H14 for all candidates.\n*   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. This is correct for the first three options.\n*   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. This is also correct.\n\nNow, let's predict the spectrum for each compound based on its molecular symmetry. The number of signals corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aliphatic singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 1 aromatic signal (s, 2H), 1 aliphatic signal (s, 12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are not equivalent. They will produce **two aromatic singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n    *   There are three sets of chemically non-equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C3), (C2), and (C5). They will produce **three aliphatic singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H : 3H : 3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 2 aromatic signals (s, 1H each), 3 aliphatic signals (s, 6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   There are two sets of chemically non-equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). They will produce **two aliphatic singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H : 6H, which is 1:1.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 1 aromatic signal (s, 2H), 2 aliphatic signals (s, 6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one aromatic singlet** (4H).\n    *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (-CH2-) protons will be split by the methyl (-CH3) protons, and vice-versa. This results in an **aliphatic quartet** (4H) and an **aliphatic triplet** (6H).\n    *   Since the problem states that all aliphatic signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**.\n\n**3. Analyze the options based on the combined spectra of a 1:1 mixture:**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give aliphatic singlets.\n\nNow we analyze the remaining pairs:\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2:2, or **1:1**. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The mixture will show a total of **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the experimental data.\n    *   This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would therefore show a total of **three aromatic singlets**. This contradicts the data, which specifies only two aromatic signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic singlets**. This contradicts the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio) is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
