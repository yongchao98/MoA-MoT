    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data:**\n    *   **Skeleton:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a core formula of `C6H4`.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (`-COO-`) is present. This group contains one carbonyl double bond (`C=O`) and contributes to the overall atom count.\n    *   **1H NMR - Aromatic Region:** There are two signals for aromatic hydrogens. A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic hydrogens. The presence of only two signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which creates a plane of symmetry, making the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent. This gives two signals, typically two doublets.\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl Region:** There are two signals for vinyl hydrogens (`-CH=CH-`). One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) attached to another group.\n        *   Let's denote the group as `R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is adjacent to `H(b)` and would appear as a doublet.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is adjacent to `H(a)` and also to the three protons of the methyl (`-CH3`) group. It would be split into a doublet by `H(a)` and a quartet by the `-CH3` group, resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment. This fragment accounts for one vinyl double bond (`C=C`).\n    *   **1H NMR - Aliphatic Region:** There are two signals for `-CH3` groups and importantly, **no signals for `-CH2-` groups**.\n        *   One `-CH3` signal comes from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The second `-CH3` signal must come from the ester group. To avoid having a `-CH2-` group, the ester must be either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-O-CO-CH3`). An ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`), for example, is ruled out because it contains a `-CH2-` group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the possible structures:**\n    Based on the analysis, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with a propenyl group and an ester group involving a methyl group. There are two possible isomers that fit this description:\n\n    *   **Structure 1:** Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. The substituents on the `C6H4` ring are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-COOCH3`.\n    *   **Structure 2:** 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate. The substituents on the `C6H4` ring are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-O-CO-CH3`.\n\n3.  **Determine the chemical formula from the deduced structures:**\n    Let's count the atoms for either of the proposed structures (as they are isomers, they will have the same formula). Let's use Structure 1: `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3`.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 1 (from `CH3`) + 1 (from `=CH-`) + 1 (from `-CH=`) + 6 (from `C6H4` ring) + 1 (from `COO`) + 1 (from `OCH3`) = **11 Carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 3 (from `CH3`) + 1 (from `=CH-`) + 1 (from `-CH=`) + 4 (from `C6H4` ring) + 3 (from `OCH3`) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from `COO` ester group) = **2 Oxygens**.\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU is a calculation to check for rings and double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU from the formula C11H12O2: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n    *   DoU from the deduced structure: 1 (benzene ring) + 3 (pi bonds in ring) + 1 (`C=C` in propenyl) + 1 (`C=O` in ester) = **6**.\n    The DoU matches, confirming the plausibility of the structure and the formula.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the other options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - 14/2 = 6. This formula has the correct DoU, but it contains an additional `CH2` group compared to C11H12O2. A structure with this formula that also has a benzene ring and an ester would almost certainly contain a `-CH2-` group (e.g., as part of an ethyl group), which contradicts the NMR data stating there are no `-CH2-` signals.\n    *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5. Incorrect DoU.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7. Incorrect DoU.\n\nConclusion: The only formula that perfectly matches all the detailed spectroscopic evidence, especially the types of signals and the absence of `-CH2-` groups, is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
