    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to determine the factor by which the ratio of the populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti I) changes. This factor is the ratio of this population ratio under two different temperature conditions: with no spots (higher temperature) and with spots (lower temperature).\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This assumption allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the relative populations of atomic energy levels.\n\n3.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states (level 2 and level 1):\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   N₂ / N₁ is the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper state (2) to the lower state (1).\n    *   g₂ / g₁ is the ratio of the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two levels. This ratio is a constant for a given transition.\n    *   E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n4.  **Define the Ratios for Both Scenarios:**\n    Let's define the population ratio as `R = N₂ / N₁`. We need to calculate this for the two given temperatures.\n    *   **No spots:** Temperature `T_nospot = 6000 K`. The ratio is `R_nospot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospot))`.\n    *   **With spots:** The overall effective temperature is `T_spot = 5500 K`. The ratio is `R_spot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spot))`.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Factor:** The question asks for \"the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This translates to calculating the ratio `R_nospot / R_spot`.\n    Factor = R_nospot / R_spot\n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spot)) ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:** The term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) is constant and cancels out.\n    Factor = exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospot)) / exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spot))\n    Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    Factor = exp( -((E₂ - E₁) / k) * (1/T_nospot) - (-((E₂ - E₁) / k) * (1/T_spot)) )\n    Factor = exp( ((E₂ - E₁) / k) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) )\n\n7.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (E₂ - E₁):** The problem provides the wavelength (λ) of the photon corresponding to the transition between the two energy levels. The energy of this photon is equal to the energy difference between the levels.\n    E₂ - E₁ = h * c / λ\n    Where:\n    *   h is the Planck constant.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters.\n\n8.  **Substitute the Energy Difference into the Factor Equation:**\n    Factor = exp( (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) )\n\n9.  **Gather Constants and Variables:**\n    *   h (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   λ = 1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m\n    *   T_nospot = 6000 K\n    *   T_spot = 5500 K\n\n10. **Perform the Calculation:** At this point, a numerical calculation is required. Using a Python script is efficient and accurate for this. The script will define the constants and variables, compute the exponent, and then calculate the final factor.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Define the given parameters\n# Wavelength in meters (1 Å = 1e-10 m)\nwavelength = 1448e-10\n# Temperature without spots in Kelvin\nT_nospot = 6000\n# Temperature with spots in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5500\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (E2 - E1)\ndelta_E = h * c / wavelength\n\n# The ratio of populations is proportional to exp(-delta_E / (k * T))\n# We need to find the factor F = Ratio(T_nospot) / Ratio(T_spot)\n# F = exp(-delta_E / (k * T_nospot)) / exp(-delta_E / (k * T_spot))\n# F = exp((-delta_E / k) * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_spot))\n# F = exp((delta_E / k) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot))\n\n# Calculate the exponent\nexponent = (delta_E / k) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.505300067332306\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation yields a factor of approximately 4.5.

    "The problem asks for the factor by which the population ratio of two energy levels of neutral Titanium changes when the star's effective temperature drops from 6000 K (no spots) to 5500 K (with spots). The key physical principle to use here is the Boltzmann equation, which is applicable because the problem states the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy state (N₂) to a lower energy state (N₁) is given by:\n    \n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    \n    where:\n    *   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n    \n2.  **Define the Ratios for Both Temperatures:** Let's denote the population ratio (N₂/N₁) as `R(T)`.\n    \n    *   For the star without spots: `T_nospot = 6000 K`\n        `R_nospot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))`\n    \n    *   For the star with spots: `T_spot = 5500 K`\n        `R_spot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))`\n    \n3.  **Calculate the Required Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of the two ratios: `Factor = R_nospot / R_spot`.\n    \n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) ]\n    \n    The statistical weight term (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n    \n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))\n    \n    Using the exponent property eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ:\n    \n    Factor = exp( (-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) )\n    Factor = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) )\n    \n4.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`.\n    \n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n    \n    where:\n    *   `h` is Planck's constant.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 * 10⁻¹⁰ m`.\n    \n5.  **Final Expression and Calculation:** Substituting the expression for `ΔE` into the factor equation gives:\n    \n    Factor = exp( (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) )\n    \n    Now, we plug in the values and calculate the result. The python code executed previously performed this exact calculation.\n\n### Calculation Summary:\n*   `h` (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   `k` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   `λ` = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   `T_nospot` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spot` = 5500 K\n\nThe code computed:\n`factor = exp( ((6.626e-34 * 3.00e8) / (1.381e-23 * 1448e-10)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) )`\nThe result of this calculation was ~4.5.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~1.1\nB) ~2.9\nC) ~7.8\nD) ~4.5\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
