    "The user wants to determine the kinematically allowed decay channels for a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV, which decays into fermion-antifermion pairs.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Interaction:**\n    The provided Lagrangian density for the interaction between the boson X and a fermion field $\\psi_f$ is:\n    $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (y) (\\upsilon + X(y)) \\psi_f(y)$\n    This can be expanded into two terms:\n    $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\upsilon \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f - \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$\n    The first term, $-\\lambda_f \\upsilon \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$, contributes to the fermion's mass, $m_f = \\lambda_f \\upsilon$.\n    The second term, $-\\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$, describes the interaction vertex where the boson X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This interaction allows for the decay of the boson X into a fermion and its corresponding antifermion: $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\n2.  **Establish the Kinematic Condition:**\n    For a particle decay to be \"kinematically allowed,\" the mass of the initial particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the final state particles. In this case, for the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$:\n    $m_X \\ge m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}$\n    Since a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n    $m_X \\ge 2m_f$\n    The question asks for the allowed decays at the lowest order, which are these two-body decays. The decay is only possible if the inequality is strict, i.e., $m_X > 2m_f$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Mass of Boson X:**\n    We are given that the mass of the boson X is $m_X = 6$ GeV.\n    Therefore, a decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$ is kinematically allowed if:\n    $6 \\text{ GeV} > 2m_f$\n    or\n    $m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n4.  **Check the Masses of All Fundamental Fermions:**\n    We need to compare the mass of each fundamental fermion (quarks and leptons) with the 3 GeV threshold. We will use the approximate masses of the fermions:\n\n    *   **Leptons:**\n        *   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.000511 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^+e^-$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.1057 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.777 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^+\\tau^-$ is **allowed**.\n\n    *   **Quarks:**\n        *   Up ($u$): $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0022 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Down ($d$): $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0047 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Strange ($s$): $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.095 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Charm ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.27 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Bottom ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $4.18 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n        *   Top ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $173 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n\n5.  **Compile the List of Allowed Decays and Compare with Options:**\n    The kinematically allowed decays are into pairs of fermions with mass less than 3 GeV. These are:\n    $u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, s\\bar{s}, c\\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \\mu^+\\mu^-, \\tau^+\\tau^-$\n\n    Now let's examine the given options:\n    *   A) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. This option incorrectly includes the forbidden decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$.\n    *   B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. This option incorrectly includes the forbidden decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$.\n    *   C) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. This option correctly lists all the allowed decays and none of the forbidden ones.\n    *   D) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. This option incorrectly includes the forbidden decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ and omits the allowed decays $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ and $X \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
