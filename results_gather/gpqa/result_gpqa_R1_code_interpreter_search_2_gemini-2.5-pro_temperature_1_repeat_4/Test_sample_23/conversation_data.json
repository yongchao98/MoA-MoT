    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: `mass % H = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), we get: `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Rearranging the equation: `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y` -> `1.7136x + 0.1428y = y` -> `1.7136x = 0.8572y`.\n    *   The ratio `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula for Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n are either alkenes (unsaturated) or cycloalkanes (saturated). Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. Let the other component of Y be W.\n    *   So, Y = {Z, W}. Hydrogenating Y means:\n        *   Z + H2 → Z (no reaction, as Z is saturated).\n        *   W + H2 → Z.\n    *   This tells us that W can be hydrogenated to form Z. Since W does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene/alkyne. The most likely candidate for W is an aromatic compound, which is generally unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated under severe conditions.\n    *   Z is described as a widely used solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). This fits the formula CnH2n for n=6.\n    *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then W must be an aromatic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The only logical choice is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X is treated with platinum (Pt) catalyst when heated to form Y. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it refers to a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → Benzene + Cyclohexane.\n    *   Since X is an equimolar mixture and it forms an equimolar mixture Y, the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1 → 1:1.\n    *   `1 molecule of A + 1 molecule of B → 1 molecule of C6H6 + 1 molecule of C6H12`\n\n4.  **Determine the Properties of Mixture X and Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   The components of X, A and B, decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives *only one* product, Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B must have a C6 carbon skeleton (a six-membered ring), which upon complete hydrogenation, yields cyclohexane.\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in (A + B).\n    *   Total H atoms in products = Total H atoms in (Benzene + Cyclohexane).\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H6) + (H atoms in C6H12) = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 18.\n\n5.  **Confirmation (Optional but helpful)**\n    *   We need to find two C6-ring unsaturated compounds (A and B) that fit the description.\n    *   The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" is important.\n    *   Let's consider possible compounds: Cyclohexene (C6H10) and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has two non-conjugated double bonds.\n    *   Let A = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) and B = Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: the diene (C6H8) loses 2 H atoms to become benzene (C6H6), and the cyclohexene (C6H10) gains these 2 H atoms to become cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   `C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt)--> C6H6 + C6H12`. This reaction is balanced and chemically plausible. All conditions of the problem are met.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component. Our calculation based on the conservation of atoms provides the answer directly.\n\nTotal H atoms = H atoms in Benzene + H atoms in Cyclohexane = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
