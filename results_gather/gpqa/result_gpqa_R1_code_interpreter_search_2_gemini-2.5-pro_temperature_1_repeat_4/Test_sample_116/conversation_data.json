    "*   **Analyze the concept of optical isomerism:** An organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule. This property is most commonly due to the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups) or due to restricted rotation that creates a chiral axis (atropisomerism) or a chiral plane.\n\n*   **Analyze compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, meaning two benzene rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** The positions ortho to the connecting C-C bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality:** In biphenyls, if the ortho positions are substituted with large enough groups, the steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the single bond that connects the two rings. This restricted rotation is called atropisomerism. The molecule becomes locked in a conformation where the two rings are not in the same plane. If the substitution pattern is appropriate (like in this case, where neither ring has a plane of symmetry that bisects it through the connecting bond), the molecule as a whole will lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It will be chiral and non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is a classic example of atropisomerism and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analyze compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n        *   It is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analyze compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is (C6H5)2CO. It has a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** The central carbon is sp2-hybridized and is only bonded to three entities (one oxygen atom and two phenyl groups). It cannot be a chiral center. The molecule has elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a C2 rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analyze compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, and it has a *trans* configuration about the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. All planar molecules have a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and are therefore achiral. It also has a center of inversion. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    *   Compound 1 shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n    *   Compound 4 does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
