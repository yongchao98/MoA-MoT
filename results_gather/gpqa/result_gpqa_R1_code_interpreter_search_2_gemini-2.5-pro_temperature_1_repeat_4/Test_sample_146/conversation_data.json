    "This problem involves a proton-antiproton annihilation process. To solve it, we will apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The reaction begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics problems, this usually implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Therefore, we can approximate the situation as an annihilation at rest, where both the proton and the antiproton are stationary.\n    *   **Initial Momentum:** Since both particles are considered to be at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n    *   **Initial Energy:** The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of an antiproton is the same as the mass of a proton ($m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n        *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   We need the value for the rest mass energy of a proton, which is approximately $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   All four particles have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest mass energy given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Final Momentum:** According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero, since the initial momentum was zero.\n    *   **Final Energy:** The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total relativistic energies of the four resulting particles. Since momentum must be conserved (sum to zero) and energy must be distributed, the four particles will fly apart with some velocity, $v$. By symmetry, each of the four particles will have the same speed $v$ and thus the same kinetic energy.\n        *   The relativistic energy of a single particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n        *   Therefore, the total final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   We equate the initial and final energies:\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for the velocity (v):**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Substitute the known values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600}$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity $v$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   We can use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300     # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# From conservation of energy: 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Calculate the velocity (v) as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\n# from the definition of gamma: v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Velocity v/c: {v_over_c:.4f}\")\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculation shows that the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a particle physics problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\", which is a common simplification in such problems. It implies that the kinetic energy of the particles before the collision is negligible compared to their rest mass energy. Therefore, we can assume they are essentially at rest.\n    *   **Final State:** Two particles of type $A^+$ and two particles of type $A^-$. All four of these resulting particles have the same mass, $m_A$.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Since the initial particles are at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n    *   By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. This means the particles must fly off in such a way that their vector momenta sum to zero. Due to the symmetry of the products (four identical mass particles), we can conclude that they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy of the system must be conserved.\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** Since the initial particles are at rest, their energy is purely their rest mass energy.\n        *   The mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n        *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n        *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The final energy is the sum of the total relativistic energies of the four resulting particles. Each particle A has mass $m_A$ and is moving with speed $v$.\n        *   The relativistic energy of a single particle is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n        *   Since there are four identical particles, the total final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n        *   We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        *   $E_{final} = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV})$.\n\n4.  **Equate Initial and Final Energies and Solve for Velocity:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n    *   Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated velocity is approximately $0.7688c$. This value, when rounded to two decimal places, is $0.77c$. This corresponds to option A.\n\nThe Python code execution confirms this calculation: `Velocity v/c: 0.7688`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
