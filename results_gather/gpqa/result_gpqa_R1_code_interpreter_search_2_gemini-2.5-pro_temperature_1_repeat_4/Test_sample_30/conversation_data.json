    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) is an ortho, para-director and an activating group. The reaction produces a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product is **para-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)**. We will assume the reaction proceeds to form the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** 4-nitrotoluene.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (4-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 are typically used to oxidize a benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid, the conditions provided suggest a more specific transformation. MnO2 is often used as a milder oxidizing agent that can selectively oxidize benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. It is also capable of oxidizing activated methyl groups, such as the one in 4-nitrotoluene, to an aldehyde. This interpretation is chemically plausible and, as we will see, leads to a well-known reaction in the next step. Assuming oxidation to the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 2:** 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (4-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH3)2C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. 4-nitrobenzaldehyde has no α-hydrogens and can only act as the electrophile. Acetone has acidic α-hydrogens and, in the presence of NaOH, forms an enolate which acts as the nucleophile. The enolate of acetone attacks the carbonyl carbon of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. The initial addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) under the reaction conditions to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The trans isomer is the major product due to lower steric hindrance.\n*   **Product 3:** trans-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    The structure is: O2N-C6H4-CH=CH-C(O)CH3.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** trans-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To determine the point group, we identify all the symmetry elements present in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule has a long conjugated system (nitro group, benzene ring, double bond, carbonyl group). For maximum stability, this system is expected to be planar.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have an identity element.\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cn):** The molecule is not symmetric with respect to any rotation. For example, rotating by 180° (C2) does not leave the molecule unchanged because one end has a nitro group (-NO2) and the other has an acetyl group (-COCH3). Thus, there are no C2, C3, or higher-order rotation axes.\n    *   **Inversion Center (i):** There is no center of inversion. Inverting through the center of the molecule would not map the molecule onto itself due to its asymmetry.\n    *   **Mirror Planes (σ):** Assuming the molecule is planar, the plane containing all the atoms of the molecule is a plane of symmetry. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged. There are no other mirror planes (e.g., a plane perpendicular to the molecular plane).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses only two symmetry elements: the identity (E) and a single mirror plane (σ). A molecule with only these two elements belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n***\n\n*Alternative pathway consideration:*\nEven if one assumes a different reaction pathway (e.g., dinitration of toluene, followed by oxidation to 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, and then deprotonation to the 2,4-dinitrobenzoate anion), the resulting molecule would also have only one plane of symmetry (the molecular plane, assuming planarity) and thus belong to the Cs point group. The consistency of the result across plausible interpretations strengthens the conclusion.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
