    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, denoted as $T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its average distance (semi-major axis, $a$) from its star. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: $P^2 \\propto a^3$.\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The energy absorbed by the planet is proportional to $1/d^2$, where $d$ is the distance from the star. The energy radiated by the planet (assuming it's a blackbody) is proportional to $T_{eq}^4$. In equilibrium, absorbed energy equals radiated energy, which leads to the relationship $T_{eq}^4 \\propto 1/d^2$, or more simply, $T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{d}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Relationship between Temperature and Orbital Period:**\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$), we can express the distance ($a$) in terms of the period ($P$): $a \\propto P^{2/3}$. For the circular orbits mentioned in the problem, the semi-major axis $a$ is the same as the orbital radius or distance $d$. So, $d \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n    *   From the equilibrium temperature formula, we have $T_{eq} \\propto d^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Now, we can substitute the expression for distance ($d$) into the temperature relationship:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n        $T_{eq} \\propto P^{(2/3) \\times (-1/2)}$\n        $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n    *   This result shows that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period.\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio Calculation:**\n    *   We need to find the ratio $T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$. Using the relationship derived in the previous step:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n        where $P_4$ and $P_2$ are the orbital periods of Planet_4 and Planet_2, respectively.\n\n5.  **Use the Given Data:**\n    *   The problem states that the orbital periods of the five planets are in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    *   This means we can set the periods relative to a constant factor, let's say $k$:\n        *   $P_1 = 1k$\n        *   $P_2 = 2k$\n        *   $P_3 = 2.5k$\n        *   $P_4 = 3.5k$\n        *   $P_5 = 5k$\n    *   Now, we can find the ratio of the periods of Planet_4 to Planet_2:\n        $\\frac{P_4}{P_2} = \\frac{3.5k}{2k} = \\frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75$\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   Substitute the period ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = (1.75)^{-1/3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{1.75}}$\n    *   To get a numerical answer, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n# The ratio is (P4/P2)^(-1/3), where P4/P2 is the ratio of the orbital periods.\nperiod_ratio = 3.5 / 2.0\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(-1/3.0)\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is related to its distance ($d$) from its star by the formula $T_{eq} \\propto d^{-1/2}$.\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$), which is the distance $d$ for a circular orbit: $P^2 \\propto d^3$.\nWe can rearrange this to express distance in terms of the period: $d \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute the relationship for distance into the equilibrium temperature formula:\n$T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the ratio of the periods of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\n$\\frac{P_4}{P_2} = \\frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75$\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = (1.75)^{-1/3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{1.75}}$\n\nUsing the value from the code execution:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
