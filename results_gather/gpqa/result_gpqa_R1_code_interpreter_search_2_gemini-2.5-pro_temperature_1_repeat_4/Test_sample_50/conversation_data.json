    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this entire system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This type of electrostatic problem is elegantly solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be modeled by removing the sphere and placing a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the surface where the sphere used to be is zero, satisfying the grounded condition.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n        *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   The image charge `q'` is located along the same line as the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to assemble it. In this case, it's the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position `d`.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The work done `U` is the integral of the force `F` required to move the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. This force is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`. The force from the sphere is equivalent to the force from the image charge `q'`.\n        `U = ∫_∞^d F_ext ⋅ dr = -∫_∞^d F_electric ⋅ dr`\n        This method is mathematically involved but leads to the correct result.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using Potential (Simpler Approach)**\n        A more direct way to find the potential energy is using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n        *   `V_induced` is the potential at the final location of the charge `q` (i.e., at distance `d` from the center) created by all *other* charges in the system. In this case, \"other charges\" are the induced charges on the surface of the sphere.\n        *   The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the induced charges (and the potential they create) are not fixed but build up as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity. The work is `∫ V dq`, and since `V` is proportional to `q`, the integral gives `(1/2)qV`.\n        *   The potential `V_induced` is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n5.  **Execution of Method 2:**\n    *   The potential at location `d` due to the image charge `q'` is `V_q'`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Now, calculate the potential `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Finally, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    The calculated result matches option B perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
