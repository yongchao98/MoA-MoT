    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The problem involves a conservative force (from Hooke's Law), so the total energy of the system is conserved. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy ($E_{total}$) of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ moving in a potential $U(x)$ is given by the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $m$ is the rest mass of the oscillator.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ is the potential energy of the harmonic oscillator, derived from Hooke's law, $F = -kx$.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Displacement (Amplitude A):**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, $x = A$, the mass is momentarily at rest.\n    *   Velocity $v = 0$.\n    *   This implies the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy at this point ($E_1$) is:\n        $E_1 = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n3.  **Energy at the Equilibrium Position (x=0):**\n    At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero, and the speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   Potential energy $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The velocity is $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy at this point ($E_2$) is:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum displacement must equal the energy at the equilibrium position:\n    $E_1 = E_2$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solving for $v_{max}$:**\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n    *   First, isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first square both sides of the equation:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n    *   Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Finally, solve for $v_{max}$ by multiplying by $c^2$ and taking the square root:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
