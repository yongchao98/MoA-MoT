    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Define Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (`n`) and the collision cross-section (σ):\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n2.  **Analyze λ1: Gas-Gas Collisions**\n    *   λ1 is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   In this scenario, the moving particles and the target particles are the same (gas molecules). Due to the relative motion of all particles, a correction factor of √2 is introduced into the denominator.\n    *   The collision cross-section, `σ_gas-gas`, is the kinetic cross-section, which is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n    *   The formula for λ1 is:\n        **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas)**\n        where `n_gas` is the number density of gas molecules.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ2: Electron-Gas Collisions**\n    *   λ2 is the mean free path of electrons from the beam scattering off the stationary gas molecules.\n    *   In this case, we have a beam of particles (electrons) hitting relatively stationary targets (gas molecules). The √2 factor is not used here.\n    *   The collision cross-section, `σ_electron-gas`, is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n    *   The formula for λ2 is:\n        **λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)**\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n    *   **`σ_gas-gas`**: This is the effective area for a \"hard-sphere\" collision between two gas molecules. It's determined by the size of their electron clouds repelling each other. It's relatively large.\n    *   **`σ_electron-gas`**: This represents the probability of a high-energy electron being significantly deflected (scattered) by a gas molecule. A 1000 kV electron is a very small, very fast particle. It primarily interacts with the strong electric field of the atomic nucleus and the individual electrons of the gas molecule. A gas molecule is mostly empty space to such an electron. Therefore, the effective area for a scattering event is much smaller than the kinetic area for a molecule-molecule collision.\n    *   From this physical reasoning, we can conclude: **`σ_gas-gas` > `σ_electron-gas`**, and likely `σ_gas-gas` >> `σ_electron-gas`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of λ2 to λ1**\n    Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1 using the formulas from steps 2 and 3:\n\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas)]\n\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas) / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)\n\n    **λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)**\n\n6.  **Draw the Final Conclusion**\n    *   We know √2 ≈ 1.414.\n    *   We established that the ratio of the cross-sections, (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas), is greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio λ2 / λ1 must be greater than √2.\n    *   **λ2 / λ1 > 1.414**\n    *   This means **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This statement is true, as our derivation shows that λ2 is greater than 1.414 * λ1, which is certainly greater than 1.22 * λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1: This is false.\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1: This is false.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is false, because our result (λ2 > 1.414 * λ1) violates the upper bound of this option.\n\nThe only statement that is consistent with the physical principles is A. The electrons travel much farther than the gas molecules before a collision, so their mean free path (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1).\n\n<<<A>>>"
