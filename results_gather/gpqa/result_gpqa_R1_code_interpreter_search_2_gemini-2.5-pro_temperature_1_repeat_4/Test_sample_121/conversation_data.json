    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents points towards an α-halogenation of the carboxylic acid. While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3, this is likely a variation. The pyridine acts as a base, and acetic anhydride can activate the carboxylic acid towards enolization/enolate formation. The enol/enolate of acetic acid then attacks bromine (Br2). The α-carbon is the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction results in the substitution of one hydrogen on the α-carbon with a bromine atom.\n    CH3COOH → Br-CH2-COOH\n*   Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester in the presence of an alcohol and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile, and ethyl bromoacetate has a good leaving group (Br-) on a primary carbon. This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction where cyanide displaces bromide.\n*   **Product 3:** Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes a proton from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This proton is particularly acidic because it is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (the cyano group -CN and the ester group -COOEt).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states *excess* NaH is used. The remaining proton on the α-carbon is still acidic and is removed by another equivalent of NaH.\n        NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a cyclic compound. The ring will contain the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentyl chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry (a C_s plane) that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the opposite carbon in the ring (C4), the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This symmetry plane dictates which protons are chemically equivalent. Protons are chemically equivalent if they are homotopic (interchangeable by a rotational axis) or enantiotopic (interchangeable by a plane of symmetry). They are non-equivalent if they are diastereotopic.\n\nLet's count the distinct signals:\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-CO-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3 protons:** The three methyl protons are equivalent due to free rotation (homotopic). This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2- protons:** The two methylene protons are enantiotopic because they are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    In a substituted cyclohexane, protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) in a CH2 group are typically diastereotopic (one axial, one equatorial) and are not chemically equivalent unless an additional symmetry element makes them equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 atom lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the plane does not interchange the axial and equatorial protons. These two protons are in different chemical environments and are diastereotopic. Therefore, they are not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C6 equivalent. The axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial proton on C6. The equatorial proton on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. Since the axial and equatorial protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other, this set of four protons gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies as for C2/C6. The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C5 equivalent. The four protons on these two carbons give **2 signals**.\n\n**Tally of Signals:**\n*   Ethyl -CH3: 1 signal\n*   Ethyl -CH2-: 1 signal\n*   Ring C4-H2: 2 signals\n*   Ring C2-H2 & C6-H2: 2 signals\n*   Ring C3-H2 & C5-H2: 2 signals\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
