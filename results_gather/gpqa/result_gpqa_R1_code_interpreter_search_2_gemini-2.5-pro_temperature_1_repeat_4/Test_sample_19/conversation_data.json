    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of this approximation and evaluate each statement.\n\nThe core idea of the **impulse approximation** is that a high-energy interaction with a nucleus happens so quickly that it can be treated as an interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. The \"impulse\" is the transfer of momentum and energy from a projectile (like an electron or neutrino) to one nucleon inside the nucleus. For the calculation to be simplified in this way, we must assume the many-body problem (the entire nucleus) can be reduced to a two-body problem (projectile + one nucleon).\n\nLet's analyze the given statements in this context:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is a fundamental part of the approximation. We assume the incoming projectile interacts with just one of the A nucleons in the nucleus. We ignore more complex interactions where the projectile might interact with a pair of nucleons or with the meson fields that bind the nucleus (these are called meson-exchange currents). This simplifies the problem from a many-body interaction to a single-nucleon interaction. This statement is **essential**.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This refers to what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the incoming projectile or the outgoing particles (the scattered projectile and the ejected nucleon) were to interact with the other (A-1) nucleons, the final measured state would be distorted. These are known as \"final-state interactions\" (FSI). Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" means we neglect these additional interactions. This is a crucial simplification for the impulse approximation to hold, ensuring that what we measure is the result of the primary \"impulse\" on the single nucleon. This statement is **essential**.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself (protons and neutrons are composed of quarks and gluons). The impulse approximation operates at the level of nucleons within a nucleus. While the internal structure of the nucleon is described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and is important for calculating nucleon form factors, the relativistic nature of its constituent quarks is a separate issue from how the nucleon behaves *within the nucleus* during a collision. The impulse approximation treats the nucleon as a single entity, not a collection of quarks. Therefore, this statement is **not a defining assumption** of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. A nucleon inside a nucleus is bound by the strong force, giving it a binding energy. The approximation assumes the interaction is so rapid and energetic that during the short time of the collision, the binding forces from the other nucleons are negligible compared to the forces involved in the collision. The nucleon is effectively \"free\" at the moment of impact. This statement is **essential**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are:\n- Interaction with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n- Neglect of initial and final state interactions, i.e., transparency (Statement 2).\n- Neglect of the nucleon's binding potential during the interaction (Statement 4).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of statements is 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
