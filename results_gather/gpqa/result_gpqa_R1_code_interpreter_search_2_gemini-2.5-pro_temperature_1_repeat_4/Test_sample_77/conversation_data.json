    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's break down the problem based on the principles of classical electrodynamics.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q`.\n*   **Motion:** The charge follows a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. Its velocity at any time `t` is $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$.\n*   **Observer:** The potentials are measured at a position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The field measured at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was generated by the charge at an earlier time, $t_r$, when it was at position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$. This earlier time is called the retarded time.\n*   **Causality Condition:** The time `t` must be later than the retarded time `t_r`, i.e., $t > t_r$. The time difference `t - t_r` is the time it takes for light to travel from the source's position at $t_r$ to the observer's position $\\vec{r}$.\n*   **Vectors:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: Position of the observer.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance the signal traveled.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nThe relationship between these quantities is defined by the speed of light:\n$d = c(t - t_r)$\n\n### 2. The Retarded Potentials\nThe general solutions for the scalar and vector potentials from a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n### 3. Potentials for a Point Charge (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials)\nFor a point charge `q` at position $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are given by Dirac delta functions:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals is a standard but non-trivial calculation in electrodynamics. The complexity arises because the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The result of this integration gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe standard result for the scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nAnd for the vector potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript $[...]_{t_r}$ means that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, $\\vec{d}`, and $\\vec{v}$) are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Given Options\nLet's manipulate the denominators in the standard formulas to match the format in the options.\nThe denominator is $S = d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\nWe can rewrite this by finding a common denominator `c`:\n$S = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the potential expressions:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{ (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c } = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{ (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c } = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nLet's compare these derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**\n    This option perfectly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it neglects retardation and the velocity-dependent term. The relation for $\\vec{A}$ is also incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**\n    The expression for V is again the incorrect static potential. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is actually correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since $\\vec{A}/V = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} = \\vec{v}/c^2$), the formula for V itself is wrong, making the option incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**\n    This option has the wrong sign in the denominator. The correct factor is $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. This sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect on the apparent volume of the charge due to its motion relative to the observer.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
