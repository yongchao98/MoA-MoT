    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   This anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm, indicating all protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   It has two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (137 ppm and 165 ppm), indicating two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   A simple dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid).\n    *   Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check if maleic anhydride fits the spectral data:\n        *   **Structure:** It's a five-membered ring with a C=C double bond and two carbonyl groups attached to an oxygen atom. Due to the molecule's C₂v symmetry, the two alkene protons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** The two equivalent alkene protons would give a single peak. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of protons on a double bond that is conjugated with two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This matches.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two types of carbons: the alkene carbons (CH=CH) and the carbonyl carbons (C=O). This predicts two signals. A signal at ~137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon, and a signal at ~165 ppm is typical for an anhydride carbonyl carbon. This also matches.\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4.\n    *   Methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   Carbon 5 is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄. The formula of maleic anhydride is C₄H₂O₃. The reaction adduct should have a formula of C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the formula given for the products.\n\n**2. The Diels-Alder Reaction and its Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction) between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   Two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   According to the **endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer, which is formed faster (kinetic product). The minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n*   Let's define the stereochemistry for this system:\n    *   **Major Product (Endo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the C7 bridge (the CH₂ group). In this conformation, the two protons on the newly formed single bond from the dienophile (let's call them H_anhydride at positions C2 and C3) are on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* to the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons are on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge.\n\n**3. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially proximate protons.\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product**. We need to find an interaction that exists in the *endo* isomer but not the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **Let's analyze the spatial proximities in the *endo* (major) isomer:**\n    *   The H_anhydride protons (at C2 and C3) are *syn* to the C7 bridge.\n    *   The C7 bridge has two diastereotopic protons. One proton (let's call it H_bridge_syn) points towards the C2-C3 bond, and the other (H_bridge_anti) points towards the C5=C6 double bond.\n    *   Because the H_anhydride protons and the C7 bridge are on the same side of the bicyclic system, there will be a close proximity between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **H_bridge_syn proton**. This will result in a strong NOE cross-peak.\n\n*   **Let's analyze the spatial proximities in the *exo* (minor) isomer:**\n    *   The H_anhydride protons are *anti* to the C7 bridge.\n    *   This means the H_anhydride protons are on the opposite face of the molecule from the C7 protons. The distance between them is large.\n    *   Therefore, there will be **no significant NOE** between the H_anhydride protons and either of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n*   **Conclusion from NOESY:** The differentiating cross-peak, which is present only in the major product, must be between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n**4. Assign the NMR Signals from the Options**\n\nNow we match our conclusion with the given options by estimating the chemical shifts and multiplicities.\n\n*   **H_anhydride protons:** These are two equivalent protons (due to symmetry) on carbons C2 and C3, which are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. They are not coupled to adjacent protons (the bridgehead carbons have no protons). Thus, they appear as a **2H singlet**. A reasonable chemical shift is **~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **C7 bridge protons:** These are two diastereotopic aliphatic protons. They are coupled to each other (geminal coupling), so they would appear as a pair of doublets (an AB system). The question simplifies this by referring to one of them as a **1H doublet**. A reasonable chemical shift for these bridged aliphatic protons is in the range of **~1.0-2.0 ppm**. The option gives **~1.5 ppm**.\n*   **Methyl protons:**\n    *   The four methyl groups are of two types. The two on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) are equivalent and would appear as a **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** (shielded).\n    *   The two on the double bond (C5, C6) are also equivalent and would appear as a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (vinylic, less shielded).\n\n*   **Matching:** The NOE cross-peak connects the H_anhydride protons with a C7 bridge proton.\n    *   H_anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   C7 bridge proton: **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option B.\n\nLet's quickly check the other options:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, Me_bridgehead) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, C7 proton). This interaction is likely present in both isomers to some extent and is not the most distinctive difference.\n*   C) 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, Me_alkene) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, H_anhydride). This interaction is strong in the *exo* (minor) product and weak/absent in the *endo* (major) product - the opposite of what is described.\n*   D) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, Me_bridgehead) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, Me_alkene). The distance between these groups is fixed by the rigid skeleton and would be the same in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that describes an NOE correlation present in the major (*endo*) but absent in the minor (*exo*) product is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
