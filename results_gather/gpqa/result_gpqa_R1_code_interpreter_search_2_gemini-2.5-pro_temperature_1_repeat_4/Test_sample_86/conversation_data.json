    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it (C6H4-).\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR: Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n    *   **FTIR: Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** One substituent is a halogen atom (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I) directly bonded to the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). It has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the C=O group and all of the remaining 2 carbon atoms (since 8 total carbons - 6 ring carbons - 0 halogen carbons = 2 carbons).\n    *   A two-carbon substituent containing a carbonyl group is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its general structure is an acetyl group and a halogen atom attached to a benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Consider the Possible Isomers (Substitution Patterns):**\n    *   The two groups (-COCH3 and -X) can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring:\n        *   **ortho (1,2-):** 2-haloacetophenone. This molecule is asymmetrical.\n        *   **meta (1,3-):** 3-haloacetophenone. This molecule is also asymmetrical.\n        *   **para (1,4-):** 4-haloacetophenone. This molecule is symmetrical.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Isomer:**\n    *   The molecule has 4 protons on the aromatic ring and 3 protons on the acetyl methyl group, for a total of 7 protons. All the given options have signals that integrate to a total of 7 protons (2+2+3=7 or 1+2+2+2=7).\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers:** Because they are asymmetrical, all 4 aromatic protons are chemically distinct. This would result in a complex spectrum in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm), likely showing four separate signals (e.g., doublet of doublets, triplets, etc.), each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Para Isomer:** Because it is symmetrical, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen are equivalent. This leads to a much simpler spectrum:\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two signals, each a doublet (due to splitting by the adjacent proton), and each integrating to 2H. This \"two-doublet\" pattern is characteristic of para-disubstitution.\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. This will appear as a **singlet**, integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low (upfield) for aromatic protons (which are typically > 6.5 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the predicted pattern for a **para-disubstituted** aromatic ring (two doublets, each for 2H). The chemical shifts are appropriate for aromatic protons near electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3H, which is exactly what is expected for the methyl protons of an **acetyl group**. The chemical shift is also in the correct range.\n        *   This data is fully consistent with the structure of **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This option contains multiple inconsistencies: incorrect chemical shifts for aromatic protons, and a strange `1.3 (2H, s)` signal that doesn't fit the structure. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde, it would not have the correct number of carbons or the methyl group protons. This is incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone is B. The specific pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region strongly indicates the para isomer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
