    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System and Energy Levels:**\n    *   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by the formula:\n        E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n        where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n    *   The problem defines a base unit of energy E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n        E_n = n² * E.\n    *   According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the energy level (n) and the spin (up or down). This means each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   The ground state is the lowest possible total energy state of the system. To achieve this, we must fill the energy levels from the lowest upwards.\n    *   **Level n=1 (E₁ = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles in this level. Their total energy is 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2 (E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We have two particles remaining. We place them in the next available level, n=2. Their total energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n    *   All four particles are now placed. The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all particles:\n        E_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n3.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_first):**\n    *   The first excited state is the state with the lowest energy just above the ground state. This is achieved by the smallest possible energy excitation, which typically involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (LUMO).\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration of particles is:\n        *   Two particles in n=1 (Energy: 2 × E₁ = 2E)\n        *   One particle in n=2 (Energy: 1 × E₂ = 4E)\n        *   One particle in n=3 (Energy: 1 × E₃ = 3²E = 9E)\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n        E_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_second):**\n    *   The second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one that results in the second-lowest energy increase.\n    *   Let's list the energies of possible configurations, starting from the ground state energy of 10E:\n        *   **First Excitation (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Total Energy = 15E.\n        *   **Next Possible Excitation:** Consider promoting a particle from a lower level, which requires more energy. Let's promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n            *   Total Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n        *   **Another Possibility:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n            *   Total Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n        *   **Another Possibility:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n            *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n            *   Total Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states we've calculated (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n5.  **Final Result:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
