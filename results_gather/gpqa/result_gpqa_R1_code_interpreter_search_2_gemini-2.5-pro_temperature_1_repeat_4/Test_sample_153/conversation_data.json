    "*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. A M+2 peak that is approximately one-third the height of the M+ peak is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. The m/z = 156 peak corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁵Cl isotope, and the m/z = 158 peak corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options (using the most common isotopes: C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35).\n        *   A) Phenyl chloroformate (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All four options have the correct molecular weight and contain one chlorine atom. We must use the other spectral data to differentiate them.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this characteristic broadness.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This value falls squarely in the range for a carboxylic acid (typically 1725-1700 cm⁻¹), especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   This combination of peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   This eliminates option A (Phenyl chloroformate), which would have a C=O stretch at a much higher frequency (~1780 cm⁻¹) and no O-H group. It also eliminates option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which has an aldehyde C=O (~1700 cm⁻¹) and a phenol O-H (broad, but usually narrower than a carboxylic acid, ~3500-3200 cm⁻¹), but lacks the specific carboxylic acid O-H signature. We are left with options B and D.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern is crucial. We have two doublets, and each signal accounts for two protons. This simple pattern indicates a highly symmetric aromatic ring. Specifically, it points to a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent chemically equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent to each other. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   Let's compare this to our remaining options:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is 1,4-disubstituted (para). It has a -COOH group and a -Cl group on opposite sides of the benzene ring. This structure would produce exactly the observed NMR pattern: a singlet for the acid proton and two doublets (each for 2H) for the aromatic protons.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). All four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments. This would result in a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four distinct signals, likely multiplets), not two clean doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the combined evidence, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the only structure that fits all the data: the correct molecular weight with a chlorine atom (MS), the presence of a carboxylic acid (IR), a carboxylic acid proton (NMR), and a para-substituted aromatic ring pattern (NMR).\n\n<<<B>>>"
