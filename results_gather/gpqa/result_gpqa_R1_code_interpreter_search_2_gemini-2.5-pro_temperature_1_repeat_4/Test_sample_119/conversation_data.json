    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Premise:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars (let's call it `ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere.\n    `ρ = Number of Stars / Volume = constant`\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:** We want to find the number of stars in a small range of distances. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer (Earth).\n    *   Let the inner radius of the shell be `d`.\n    *   Let the thickness of the shell be a very small amount, `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin spherical shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness. The surface area of a sphere is `4πd²`.\n    *   So, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the number density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`).\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4πd² * dd)`\n    *   Since `ρ` and `4π` are constants, we can say that the number of stars in a small distance interval `dd` is proportional to `d²`.\n    *   `dN ∝ d² * dd`\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`). For simplicity in the equations, let's use `p` for parallax.\n    *   `p = 1/d`\n    *   This also means `d = 1/p`.\n\n5.  **Connect the Differentials:** We have an expression involving `dd` (a small change in distance), but the question asks for the distribution per unit range of parallax, which involves `dp` (a small change in parallax). We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `dp`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `p`.\n    *   `d = 1/p`\n    *   `dd/dp = -1/p²`\n    *   This means `dd = -dp/p²`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`p`) decreases. When we are considering the number of stars in a range, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval. So, we can write `|dd| = |dp|/p²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Star Count Equation:** Now, we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`.\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/p`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/p)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = dp/p²` (ignoring the negative sign as we are dealing with counts): `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/p²) * (dp/p²) `\n    *   Combine the terms: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/p⁴) * dp`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* changes with parallax. This is the quantity `dN/dp`.\n    *   From the equation above, we can rearrange to find `dN/dp`:\n    *   `dN/dp = ρ * 4π * (1/p⁴)`\n    *   Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    *   `dN/dp ∝ 1/p⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax (`plx`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
