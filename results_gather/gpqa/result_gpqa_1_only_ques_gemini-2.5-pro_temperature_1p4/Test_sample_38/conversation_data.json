    "To find the value of the constant \"a\", we must use the normalization condition for the wave function. The normalization condition states that the total probability of finding the particle anywhere it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nwhere the integral is taken over all space where the particle can be found.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the probability density function |Ψ(x)|²**\n\nThe wave function is given as a complex function:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe probability density, |Ψ(x)|², is the square of the modulus of the wave function. For a complex number z = Re + i*Im, the modulus squared is |z|² = Re² + Im².\nIn our case:\n*   The real part is Re(Ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   The imaginary part is Im(Ψ) = -0.5\n\nSo, the probability density is:\n|Ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**Step 2: Set up the normalization integral**\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. This is our integration range.\n\n∫[from 1 to 3] |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n**Step 3: Solve the integral**\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **First part:**\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² ∫[from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx\n    = a² * [ln(1 + x)] (from 1 to 3)\n    = a² * [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)]\n    = a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)]\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n*   **Second part:**\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [0.25 * x] (from 1 to 3)\n    = 0.25 * (3 - 1)\n    = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \"a\"**\n\nNow, substitute the results back into the equation:\n(a² * ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\nSubtract 0.5 from both sides:\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\nIsolate a²:\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\nNow, take the square root to find \"a\":\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n(Note: The information about 10,000 systems is to reinforce that this is a valid quantum mechanical system, but it is not needed for the calculation of the normalization constant \"a\", which is a property of the single-particle wave function.)\n\n<<<D>>>"
