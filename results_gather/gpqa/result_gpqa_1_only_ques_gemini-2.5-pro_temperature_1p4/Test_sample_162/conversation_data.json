    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum volume of a strong acid needed to dissolve a specific amount of Fe(OH)₃ and the pH of the resulting solution. Let's break down the problem into clear steps.\n\n**Step 1: Write the chemical reaction and calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.**\n\nThe dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, a sparingly soluble base, in a strong acid occurs via the following neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃:\nMolar Mass (Fe(OH)₃) = M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H))\nMolar Mass (Fe(OH)₃) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved:\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 9.3575 × 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stoichiometric amount of acid needed for the reaction.**\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\nTherefore, the moles of H⁺ required to react completely with the Fe(OH)₃ are:\nMoles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\nMoles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 9.3575 × 10⁻⁴ mol = 2.80725 × 10⁻³ mol.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the equilibrium condition for dissolution.**\n\nAlthough the reaction with a strong acid proceeds nearly to completion, for the Fe(OH)₃ to remain dissolved, the solution must be sufficiently acidic to prevent the reverse reaction (precipitation). The dissolution is an equilibrium process:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe \"minimum volume\" of acid implies that just enough acid is added to dissolve the solid completely. At this point, the solution is saturated. This means there will be a certain equilibrium concentration of H⁺ ions remaining in the solution.\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added must therefore be the sum of the moles that reacted and the moles that remain at equilibrium:\nTotal moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (at equilibrium)\n\nThe volume of 0.1 M acid required will be:\nVolume of acid = Total moles H⁺ / 0.1 M\n\nSince there must be some H⁺ at equilibrium (Moles H⁺ (at equilibrium) > 0), the total moles of H⁺ added must be greater than the stoichiometric amount (2.80725 × 10⁻³ mol).\nThe minimum volume of acid required for the stoichiometric reaction alone would be:\nVolume (stoichiometric) = (2.80725 × 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.0280725 L = 28.07 cm³.\nTherefore, the actual volume needed must be greater than 28.07 cm³.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n\n*   A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   C) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n*   D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n\nBased on our calculation in Step 3, the required volume must be > 28.07 cm³.\n*   Option A (28.05 cm³) is less than the minimum stoichiometric requirement. Incorrect.\n*   Option D (20.40 cm³) is less than the minimum stoichiometric requirement. Incorrect.\n\nThis leaves us with options B and C. We can check which of these is self-consistent.\n\n**Step 5: Perform a self-consistency check for options B and C.**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added (from the volume of acid) must equal the amount that reacted plus the amount left over at equilibrium (calculated from the pH).\n\nLet's test **Option C**: pH = 2.69; Volume = 30.09 cm³\n1.  **Total moles of H⁺ added**:\n    Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    Total moles H⁺ = Volume × Concentration = 0.03009 L × 0.1 mol/L = 3.009 × 10⁻³ mol.\n\n2.  **Moles of H⁺ remaining at equilibrium**:\n    pH = 2.69  =>  [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.042 × 10⁻³ M.\n    Total Volume of solution = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    Moles H⁺ (equilibrium) = [H⁺] × Total Volume = (2.042 × 10⁻³) × 0.1 L = 2.042 × 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n3.  **Moles of H⁺ consumed in the reaction**:\n    Moles H⁺ (consumed) = Total moles H⁺ - Moles H⁺ (equilibrium)\n    Moles H⁺ (consumed) = (3.009 × 10⁻³) - (2.042 × 10⁻⁴) = 2.8048 × 10⁻³ mol.\n\n4.  **Compare**:\n    The moles of H⁺ consumed calculated from the option's data (2.8048 × 10⁻³ mol) is extremely close to the stoichiometric requirement we calculated in Step 2 (2.80725 × 10⁻³ mol). The minor difference is due to rounding in the problem's options. This option is self-consistent.\n\nNow, let's test **Option B**: pH = 3.16; Volume = 32.14 cm³\n1.  **Total moles of H⁺ added**:\n    Volume = 32.14 cm³ = 0.03214 L\n    Total moles H⁺ = 0.03214 L × 0.1 mol/L = 3.214 × 10⁻³ mol.\n\n2.  **Moles of H⁺ remaining at equilibrium**:\n    pH = 3.16  =>  [H⁺] = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M ≈ 6.92 × 10⁻⁴ M.\n    Moles H⁺ (equilibrium) = (6.92 × 10⁻⁴) × 0.1 L = 6.92 × 10⁻⁵ mol.\n\n3.  **Moles of H⁺ consumed in the reaction**:\n    Moles H⁺ (consumed) = (3.214 × 10⁻³) - (6.92 × 10⁻⁵) = 3.145 × 10⁻³ mol.\n\n4.  **Compare**:\n    This value (3.145 × 10⁻³ mol) is not close to the stoichiometric requirement (2.807 × 10⁻³ mol). This option is not self-consistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option C provides a volume of acid and a final pH that are consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
