    "This is a classic problem in peptide chemistry that points to the presence of conformational isomers, specifically rotamers. Let's break down the evidence and evaluate the options.\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with equal integrals that sum to one, indicates that the molecule exists in two different chemical environments. These two forms are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio and are not rapidly interconverting on the NMR timescale (otherwise, a single, broadened peak would be observed). Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the two environments must be due to the molecule existing as a mixture of isomers.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two distinct species that can be separated chromatographically. The fact that they have the *same mass spectrum*, which matches the expected product, proves they are isomers of your target compound. The use of elevated temperature for separation is a key clue, often used to resolve slowly interconverting conformational isomers.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on this evidence:\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect. A precursor would have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. The data clearly shows both peaks have the same mass as the product.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect. Enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) are indistinguishable in a standard, achiral environment. They would produce a single set of peaks in a standard ¹H NMR spectrum and would co-elute as a single peak on a standard (achiral) LC column.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is the correct explanation. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **In NMR:** They are distinct and will give different sets of peaks.\n    *   **In LC:** They have different polarities and can be separated by standard chromatography.\n    *   **What kind of diastereomers?** In peptides, the most common source of this phenomenon is **restricted rotation about the amide (peptide) bond**. The amide bond has significant double-bond character, making rotation slow. This creates two stable planar conformers: *cis* and *trans*. These *cis/trans* isomers are a form of diastereomer (specifically, they are rotamers or atropisomers). The alpha-proton's chemical environment is highly sensitive to the conformation of the adjacent peptide bond, leading to two distinct signals. This is especially common for peptide bonds involving proline, but can be observed for other amino acids as well. Another possibility is that one of the chiral centers of an amino acid racemized during synthesis, also creating a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., an L-L peptide contaminated with an L-D peptide). In either case, the mixture consists of diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a vague term for a side reaction. Such a reaction would almost certainly produce a byproduct with a different chemical structure and molecular weight, which is inconsistent with the LC-MS data showing two isomers of the same mass.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of two separable isomers with the same mass, which give distinct signals in the NMR, is classic evidence for a mixture of diastereomers. In the context of a synthesized peptide, this is most commonly caused by slow rotation around an amide bond, resulting in a mixture of *cis* and *trans* rotamers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
