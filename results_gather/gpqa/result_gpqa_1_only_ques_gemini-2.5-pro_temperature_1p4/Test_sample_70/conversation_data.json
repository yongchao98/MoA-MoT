    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.\n\n**1. Understand Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the incoming solar flux. For a planet in a circular orbit, the relationship is:\n\nT_eq ∝ ( (1 - A) / d² )^(1/4)\n\nwhere:\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `d` is the planet's orbital distance from its star.\n\nWe are asked for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 (T_eq4) and Planet_2 (T_eq2).\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ ( (1 - A₄) / d₄² )^(1/4) ] / [ ( (1 - A₂) / d₂² )^(1/4) ]\n\nSince the problem states that the planets possess the same albedo (A₄ = A₂), the `(1 - A)` term cancels out:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( d₂² / d₄² )^(1/4) = (d₂ / d₄)^(1/2)\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which is the orbital distance `d` for a circular orbit):\n\nP² ∝ d³\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the distance in terms of the period:\n\nd ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nNow we can write the ratio of the distances d₂ / d₄ in terms of their periods P₂ / P₄:\n\nd₂ / d₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n\n**3. Combine the Equations and Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nSubstitute the expression for the distance ratio (from Step 2) into the temperature ratio equation (from Step 1):\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n\nWhen raising a power to another power, we multiply the exponents:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we use the orbital period ratios given in the problem:\nP₁ : P₂ : P₃ : P₄ : P₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n\nFrom this, we get the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\nP₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5\n\nSubstitute this value into our final equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (20 / 35)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n4 / 7 ≈ 0.5714\n(0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
