    "Here is a breakdown of each option to determine which planet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially Earth, which serves as our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given as ~5.5 g/cm³, the same as Earth's.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For a planet with the same rocky and metallic composition, increasing the mass also increases its gravitational pull. This stronger gravity compresses the material throughout the planet's interior, packing it more tightly. Therefore, a more massive planet with the same composition will have a *higher* average density than its less massive counterpart. Its density will be significantly greater than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Using the same logic as above, but in reverse, a less massive planet has weaker gravity. This leads to less compression of its internal materials. Therefore, a planet with the same composition but half of Earth's mass will be *less* dense than Earth. Its density will be less than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Planet (a) and (b) have a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) has a density < 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) has a density > 5.5 g/cm³.\n\nTherefore, the planet with the highest density is the one described in option (c).\n\n<<<A>>>"
