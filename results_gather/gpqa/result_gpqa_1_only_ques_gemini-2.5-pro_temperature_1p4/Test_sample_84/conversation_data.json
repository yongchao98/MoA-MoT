    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Formula for the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * [ (1 - A) * R_star² / (4 * a²) ]^(1/4)\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving a simple relationship:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of their orbits.\n\n**2. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the \"wobble\" of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K_star) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK_star = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` is the mass of the planet.\n*   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n*(This formula assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's and the orbit is viewed edge-on (sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a valid assumption for a transiting planet).*\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\na = G * M_p² / (M_star * K_star²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n\na2 / a1 = [G * M2² / (M_star * K_star2²)] / [G * M1² / (M_star * K_star1²)]\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\na2 / a1 = (M2 / M1)² * (K_star1 / K_star2)²\n\n**3. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and RV Semi-Amplitude**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio (M2 / M1):**\n    *   M1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   M2 / M1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K_star1 / K_star2):**\n    The semi-amplitude `K_star` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) it causes.\n    K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    So, the ratio `K_star1 / K_star2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n    *   K_star1 / K_star2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow, substitute the calculated ratios back into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, use the ratio of the semi-major axes to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
