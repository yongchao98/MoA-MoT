    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nThe system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge q = 2e.\n- One particle (q_c) is fixed at a point P.\n- 12 particles (q_i, where i=1 to 12) are constrained to move on the surface of a sphere of radius R = 2 m, centered at P.\nThe goal is to find the minimum total electrostatic potential energy of this isolated system.\n\n**2. Formulate the Total Potential Energy**\n\nThe total potential energy (E_total) of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can split this into two parts:\n1.  The interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 shell charges (E_central).\n2.  The interaction energy among the 12 shell charges themselves (E_shell).\n\nE_total = E_central + E_shell\n\n**3. Calculate the Central Interaction Energy (E_central)**\n\nThe distance from the central charge (q_c = q) to each of the 12 shell charges (q_i = q) is always R. The potential energy for one such pair is k * q^2 / R. Since there are 12 shell charges, the total energy from this interaction is:\nE_central = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)\nThis value is constant regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere.\n\n**4. Minimize the Shell Interaction Energy (E_shell)**\n\nThe interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere is:\nE_shell = Σ (from 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 12) [k * q^2 / r_ij]\nwhere r_ij is the distance between charges q_i and q_j on the sphere.\n\nTo minimize the total energy E_total, we need to minimize E_shell, as E_central is constant. The problem of finding the arrangement of N identical charges on a sphere that minimizes their mutual potential energy is known as the **Thomson problem**.\n\nFor N=12, the proven minimum-energy configuration is when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron** inscribed in the sphere.\n\n**5. Calculate the Shell Energy for the Icosahedral Configuration**\n\nThe energy E_shell can be written as E_shell = U_12 * (k * q^2 / R), where U_12 is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of inverse distances for the icosahedral arrangement.\nWe need to calculate this sum over all C(12, 2) = 66 pairs of vertices. In a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R:\n- There are 30 pairs of adjacent vertices, separated by a distance 'a' (the edge length).\n- There are 30 pairs of next-nearest vertices, separated by a distance 'b'.\n- There are 6 pairs of antipodal vertices, separated by a distance 'c' = 2R.\n\nThe distances are related by:\n- a = R * sqrt( (10 - 2*sqrt(5)) / 5 )\n- b = a * φ, where φ = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 is the golden ratio.\n- c = 2R\n\nThe dimensionless energy sum U_12 is:\nU_12 = 30 * (R/a) + 30 * (R/b) + 6 * (R/c)\nSubstituting the relations:\nU_12 = 30 * (R/a) + 30 * (R/(aφ)) + 6 * (R/(2R))\nU_12 = 30 * (R/a) * (1 + 1/φ) + 3\nUsing the property of the golden ratio, 1 + 1/φ = φ:\nU_12 = 30 * φ * (R/a) + 3\n\nCalculating R/a:\nR/a = 1 / sqrt( (10 - 2*sqrt(5)) / 5 ) = sqrt( 5 / (10 - 2*sqrt(5)) ) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5)) / 8 ) ≈ 0.9510565\n\nNow calculate U_12:\nU_12 ≈ 30 * (1.618034) * (0.9510565) + 3\nU_12 ≈ 46.16525 + 3\nU_12 ≈ 49.16525\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Minimum Energy**\n\nNow we can combine the parts:\nE_total = E_central + E_shell\nE_total = 12 * (k * q^2 / R) + U_12 * (k * q^2 / R)\nE_total = (12 + U_12) * (k * q^2 / R)\nE_total ≈ (12 + 49.16525) * (k * q^2 / R)\nE_total ≈ 61.16525 * (k * q^2 / R)\n\n**7. Substitute Physical Constants and Calculate the Final Value**\n\nThe constants are:\n- Coulomb's constant, k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N·m²/C²\n- Elementary charge, e ≈ 1.602177 × 10^-19 C\n- Charge of each particle, q = 2e = 2 * (1.602177 × 10^-19 C) = 3.204354 × 10^-19 C\n- Radius, R = 2 m\n\nFirst, calculate the energy unit (k * q^2 / R):\nk * q^2 / R = (8.98755 × 10^9) * (3.204354 × 10^-19)^2 / 2\nk * q^2 / R ≈ (8.98755 × 10^9) * (1.026788 × 10^-37) / 2\nk * q^2 / R ≈ 9.2285 × 10^-28 / 2\nk * q^2 / R ≈ 4.61425 × 10^-28 J\n\nNow, calculate the total energy:\nE_total ≈ 61.16525 * (4.61425 × 10^-28 J)\nE_total ≈ 282.256 × 10^-28 J\nE_total ≈ 2.82256 × 10^-26 J\n\n**8. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated energy is E_total ≈ 2.82256 × 10^-26 J. Let's look at the given options:\nA) 7.056 x 10^-27 J = 0.7056 x 10^-26 J (This would be the answer if q=e was used instead of q=2e)\nB) 2.822 x 10^-26 J\nC) 5.645 x 10^-26 J (This is almost exactly 2 times option B, a likely distractor if one mishandles the energy summation formula)\nD) 122.330 J (Incorrect order of magnitude)\n\nOur calculated value of 2.82256 × 10^-26 J is extremely close to option B, 2.822 × 10^-26 J. The minor difference (about 0.02%) is due to rounding of constants or the dimensionless energy value used to create the question options. Option B is the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
