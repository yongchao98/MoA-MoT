    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Define the initial state and operators**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix (ket vector):\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe operators for the observables P and Q are:\n$P = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$Q = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Normalize the initial state vector**\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. The squared norm is:\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (-1)^*(-1) + (2)^*(2) + (1)^*(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6$\nThe normalization constant is $1/\\sqrt{6}$. So, the normalized state vector $|\\psi_{norm}\\rangle$ is:\n$|\\psi_{norm}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Find the eigenvector for the measurement of P=0**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of getting the value 0 when measuring P. The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator. Let's find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_P = 0$.\nWe need to solve the equation $P|p_0\\rangle = 0|p_0\\rangle$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis gives us the equations:\n1.  $y/\\sqrt{2} = 0 \\implies y = 0$\n2.  $x/\\sqrt{2} + z/\\sqrt{2} = 0 \\implies x = -z$\n\nSo the eigenvector is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ 0 \\\\ -x \\end{pmatrix}$. To normalize it, we let x=1 and divide by the norm:\nNorm = $\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nThe normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0, denoted as $|p_0\\rangle$, is:\n$|p_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Calculate the probability of measuring P=0**\n\nThe probability of measuring P=0 is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvector $|p_0\\rangle$.\n$Prob(P=0) = |\\langle p_0 | \\psi_{norm} \\rangle|^2$\n$\\langle p_0 | \\psi_{norm} \\rangle = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle p_0 | \\psi_{norm} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ] = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-2}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n$Prob(P=0) = \\left| \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**5. Determine the state after the first measurement**\n\nAfter measuring P and getting the result 0, the state of the system \"collapses\" into the corresponding eigenvector $|p_0\\rangle$. So the new state of the system, let's call it $|\\psi'\\rangle$, is:\n$|\\psi'\\rangle = |p_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**6. Find the eigenvector for the measurement of Q=-1**\n\nNow we measure Q on the new state $|\\psi'\\rangle$. The question asks for the probability of getting the value -1. Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\nThe eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_Q = -1$ is:\n$|q_{-1}\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**7. Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 from the collapsed state**\n\nThe probability of measuring Q=-1 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the new state $|\\psi'\\rangle$ onto the eigenvector $|q_{-1}\\rangle$.\n$Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |\\langle q_{-1} | \\psi' \\rangle|^2$\n$\\langle q_{-1} | \\psi' \\rangle = \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle q_{-1} | \\psi' \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} [ (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1) ] = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n$Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = \\left| \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n**8. Calculate the joint probability**\n\nThe total probability of measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in steps 4 and 7.\n$Prob(\\text{total}) = Prob(P=0) \\times Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)$\n$Prob(\\text{total}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n<<<B>>>"
