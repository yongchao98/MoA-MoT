    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the physical process and conservation laws**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$).\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nIn any particle interaction, both energy and momentum must be conserved. The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of high-energy physics, this typically means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. The simplest scenario consistent with this information is to assume the annihilation occurs with the center of mass of the proton-antiproton system at rest. This means the total initial kinetic energy is negligible and the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n**2. Calculate the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\nThe initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_{p}c^{2} \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}}c^{2} \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_{p}c^{2} + m_{\\bar{p}}c^{2} = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nSince we assume the annihilation occurs at rest, the total initial momentum is $\\vec{p}_{initial} = 0$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total final energy ($E_{final}$)**\n\nThe initial energy is converted into the four final particles. By conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. The most symmetric way for this to happen is for the four A particles to fly off with equal speeds, and therefore equal energies.\n\nLet the energy of a single particle A be $E_{A}$. The total final energy is:\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_{A}$\n\nThe energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$.\nSo, $E_{final} = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n**4. Apply the conservation of energy**\n\nSet the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe are given that $m_{A}c^{2}=300 \\text{ MeV}$. Substitute this value into the equation:\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$1876 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n**5. Solve for the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n**6. Calculate the velocity (v) from the Lorentz factor**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to the velocity by the formula:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for $v$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we found:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5908}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7686$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n**7. Compare with the given options**\nA) 0.91c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.96c\n\nOur calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
