    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to identify each compound:\n\n1.  **Compound A (C3H6) → Compound B:**\n    *   The molecular formula C3H6 corresponds to an alkene (propene) or a cycloalkane (cyclopropane).\n    *   The reaction is bromination in CCl4, which is a characteristic addition reaction for alkenes.\n    *   Therefore, Compound A is **propene** (CH3-CH=CH2).\n    *   Propene reacts with bromine (Br2) to undergo electrophilic addition across the double bond.\n    *   CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n    *   Compound B is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n\n2.  **Compound B → Compound C:**\n    *   Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH.\n    *   Alcoholic KOH is a strong base used for dehydrohalogenation (elimination). Since B is a vicinal dihalide, it will undergo double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne.\n    *   CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH(alc.) → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n    *   Compound C is **propyne**.\n\n3.  **Compound C → Compound D:**\n    *   Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube.\n    *   This is a cyclic polymerization (trimerization) reaction of alkynes to form aromatic compounds.\n    *   3 CH3-C≡CH --(red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    *   Compound D is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n\n4.  **Compound D → Compound E:**\n    *   Compound D (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the nitrating mixture (conc. HNO3 + conc. H2SO4).\n    *   This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). The methyl groups are activating and ortho-, para-directing. In mesitylene, positions 2, 4, and 6 are all equivalent and highly activated.\n    *   Mesitylene + HNO3 + H2SO4 → 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + H2O\n    *   Compound E is **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n\n5.  **Compound E → Compound F:**\n    *   Compound E (2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) reacts with iron scrap and HCl.\n    *   This is a standard reaction for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    *   Compound F is **2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesidine)**.\n\n6.  **Compound F → Compound G:**\n    *   Compound F (Mesidine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2), typically generated from NaNO2/HCl at low temperature (0-5 °C).\n    *   This is the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine.\n    *   Mesidine + HNO2 → 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene-2-diazonium salt\n    *   Compound G is the **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene-2-diazonium salt**.\n\n7.  **Compound G → Compound H:**\n    *   Compound G (diazonium salt) reacts with NaOH (or simply with warming in water) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   1,3,5-trimethylbenzene-2-diazonium salt --(H2O/heat or NaOH)--> 2-hydroxy-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + N2\n    *   Compound H is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol** (the IUPAC name, where the OH group gets position 1) also known as **Mesitol**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n**A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is Mesidine (2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Aromatic amines are common precursors for azo dyes, which are a large class of synthetic colorants. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test for phenols produces a distinct purple, green, or blue color due to the formation of a colored complex. However, phenols with bulky substituent groups at both ortho positions (like the two methyl groups in H) are sterically hindered and do not allow the formation of this complex. Therefore, they do not give a positive test. The solution remains yellow, which is the color of the FeCl3 reagent itself. A yellow color indicates a negative result, not a positive reaction. Thus, the statement that it *gives* a yellow color is incorrect. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is Mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to its high symmetry, the three aromatic protons (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are chemically equivalent and appear as one singlet. The nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent and appear as another singlet. Therefore, its 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**D) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature and pressure. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\nThe incorrect statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
