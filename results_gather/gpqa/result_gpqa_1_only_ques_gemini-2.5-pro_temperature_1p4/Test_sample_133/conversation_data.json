    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n**1. Understand the Reactions**\n\nTwo main reactions will occur when these substances are mixed:\n*   **Neutralization:** A strong acid reacts with a strong base. The net ionic equation is:\n    H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)     ΔH° = -57.1 kJ/mol or -13.6 kcal/mol\n*   **Precipitation:** Barium ions from Ba(OH)₂ will react with sulfate ions from H₂SO₄ to form an insoluble precipitate, barium sulfate.\n    Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n    This reaction also releases heat (exothermic), but typically, when a question asks for \"enthalpy of neutralization\", it refers specifically to the heat from the H⁺ + OH⁻ reaction. We will first calculate this value, as it is the primary process.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ ions (from the acids)**\n\n*   **From HCl:**\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻), moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.10 mol.\n*   **From H₂SO₄:**\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H₂SO₄ is a strong acid that releases two protons (H₂SO₄ → 2H⁺ + SO₄²⁻), moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of OH⁻ ions (from the base)**\n\n*   **From Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**4. Identify the Limiting Reactant for Neutralization**\n\n*   The neutralization reaction is H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O.\n*   We have 0.28 moles of H⁺ and 0.20 moles of OH⁻.\n*   Since the molar ratio is 1:1, the reactant with the smaller number of moles is the limiting reactant.\n*   Therefore, **OH⁻ is the limiting reactant**.\n*   The number of moles of water formed will be equal to the moles of the limiting reactant, which is **0.20 mol**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Neutralization**\n\n*   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.6 kcal per mole of water formed.\n*   Total Enthalpy Change (ΔH) = (moles of water formed) × (enthalpy of neutralization per mole)\n*   ΔH = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\n*   ΔH = -2.72 kcal\n\nThis value exactly matches one of the options. This confirms that the question is asking only for the heat released from the neutralization reaction and expects us to ignore the heat of precipitation for BaSO₄.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Moles of H⁺ = (0.5 L × 0.2 M) + (0.3 L × 0.3 M × 2) = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.2 L × 0.5 M × 2 = 0.20 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O formed (based on limiting OH⁻) = 0.20 mol\n*   Enthalpy = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal\n\n<<<B>>>"
