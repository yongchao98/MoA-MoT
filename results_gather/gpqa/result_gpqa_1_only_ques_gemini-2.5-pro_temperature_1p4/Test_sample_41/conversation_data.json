    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n    $T_{eq}^4 = \\frac{L_*(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a^2}$\n    where:\n    *   $L_*$ is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light it reflects).\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\n    For planets orbiting the same star, $L_*$ and $\\sigma$ are constants. The problem states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the entire term $\\frac{L_*(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma}$ is constant for this system. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $T_{eq}^4 \\propto \\frac{1}{a^2}$\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides gives:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    This means that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. We can also write this as:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n\n2.  **Understand the Relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance.**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its orbital distance ($a$). For planets orbiting the same star, the law is:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rearranged to express the distance in terms of the period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n    (Note: The information about the planets' masses is a distractor. For exoplanets, the planet's mass is almost always negligible compared to the star's mass, so this simplified form of Kepler's law is highly accurate.)\n\n3.  **Combine the Two Relationships to Relate Period and Temperature.**\n    We have two expressions for the orbital distance ($a$):\n    *   $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n    *   $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n    Setting them proportional to each other:\n    $P^{2/3} \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n    To solve for $P$, we raise both sides to the power of 3/2:\n    $(P^{2/3})^{3/2} \\propto (\\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2})^{3/2}$\n    $P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^3}$\n    This crucial result tells us that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Ratios.**\n    We need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio $P_3 / P_1$.\n    Using the relationship from step 3:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}})^3$\n\n    We are given the temperature ratios between adjacent planets:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\approx 2.3$\n\n    To find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}}$, we multiply the two given ratios:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\approx 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    Now substitute this temperature ratio back into the period ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\approx 3.22 \\times 3.22 \\times 3.22 \\approx 10.3684 \\times 3.22 \\approx 33.386$\n\n    This value is approximately 33.4.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nOur calculated factor of ~33.4 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
