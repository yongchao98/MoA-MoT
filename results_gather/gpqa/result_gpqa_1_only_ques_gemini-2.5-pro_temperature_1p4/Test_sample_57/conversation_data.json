    "Let's break down each option:\n\n**Regularization at high energies** (or ultraviolet regularization) is a procedure used in quantum field theory to deal with infinite quantities that arise in calculations. These infinities typically come from loop diagrams, which represent virtual particles, and are associated with interactions at very short distances or, equivalently, very high energies (the \"ultraviolet\" regime).\n\n*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** While not a quantum theory, classical electrodynamics has its own famous high-energy/short-distance problem. The self-energy of a point charge (like an electron) is infinite. Calculating the energy in the electric field of a point charge leads to an integral that diverges as the distance from the charge approaches zero. This is a classical divergence that requires a form of regularization (e.g., assuming the particle has a small but non-zero size). So, this theory does require a form of regularization.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) & D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** These are the archetypal examples of quantum field theories that **do** require regularization and renormalization. Calculations of physical processes, like the scattering of particles, involve integrals that diverge at high energies. Techniques like dimensional regularization or cutoff regularization are essential to make mathematical sense of the theory and extract finite, physical predictions. The success of renormalization in QED and QCD is a cornerstone of the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\n*   **B) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for string theory is that it is believed to be a quantum theory of gravity that is free from ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. Unlike the point-like particles of QED and QCD, the fundamental objects in string theory are one-dimensional, extended strings. Their interactions are not localized at a single spacetime point but are \"smeared out.\" This smearing effect naturally smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to divergences in standard quantum field theories. As a result, calculations of scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are expected to be finite and do not require the procedure of regularization to handle high-energy infinities.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the one theory on the list that is constructed to be finite at high energies and thus never requires regularization for that purpose.\n\n<<<B>>>"
