    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of compound D.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\nCompound A has the following ¹H NMR signals:\n*   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H.\n*   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H.\n\nThis pattern and integration ratio (6H:4H or 3H:2H) is characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH₃-CH₂-). A triplet for the 3H signal means it's adjacent to a CH₂ group (2+1=3). A quartet for the 2H signal means it's adjacent to a CH₃ group (3+1=4). The total number of protons is 10. The structure consistent with this data and a molecular formula of C₄H₁₀ is n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃). For the purposes of an introductory problem, the complex multiplet for the internal CH₂ groups is often simplified to a quartet.\n**Compound A is n-butane.**\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\nCompound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form B. This is a free-radical halogenation. Bromine is selective and will predominantly substitute at the secondary carbon atom.\nCH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃ + Br₂ → CH₃CH(Br)CH₂CH₃ + CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂Br\n(2-bromobutane, major)  (1-bromobutane, minor)\n\nThe subsequent reaction forms a product with geometrical isomers, which requires the formation of a disubstituted alkene like but-2-ene. This can only be formed from 2-bromobutane.\n**Compound B is 2-bromobutane.**\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\nCompound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a dehydrohalogenation (E2 elimination) reaction. According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product.\nCH₃CH(Br)CH₂CH₃ + KOH(alc) → CH₃CH=CHCH₃ (but-2-ene, major) + CH₂=CHCH₂CH₃ (but-1-ene, minor)\n\nBut-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: cis-but-2-ene and trans-but-2-ene.\n**Compound C is but-2-ene.** The problem specifies that the cis-isomer is used in the next step.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D**\nThe cis-isomer of C (cis-but-2-ene) reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. This is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n\n*   **Dienophile:** cis-but-2-ene. The cis geometry means the two methyl groups will be cis to each other in the product.\n*   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. Let's determine its structure and the orientation of its substituents in the required s-cis conformation.\n    *   The diene is `HO-C1H=C2H-C3H=C4H-CH3`.\n    *   The (1E) configuration means the high-priority groups on C1 (OH) and C2 (C3) are on opposite sides.\n    *   The (3E) configuration means the high-priority groups on C3 (C2) and C4 (CH3) are on opposite sides.\n    *   In the reactive s-cis conformation, the substituents at the ends of the diene system (C1 and C4) are oriented either \"in\" (towards the center of the forming ring) or \"out\" (away from the center). For this specific diene, the OH group at C1 is \"out\" and the CH₃ group at C4 is also \"out\".\n    *   According to the rules of Diels-Alder stereochemistry, the \"out\" groups on the diene end up cis to each other in the final product. So, the C1-OH group and the C4-CH₃ group are cis to each other.\n\n*   **Cycloaddition and Product Structure:**\n    *   The reaction forms a six-membered ring. The product is a 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. This eliminates options C and D.\n    *   The relative stereochemistry depends on whether the addition is endo or exo.\n        *   **Endo Addition (Kinetically Favored):** The substituents of the dienophile are oriented cis to the \"in\" groups of the diene (and thus trans to the \"out\" groups). This would place the {C1-OH, C4-CH₃} pair trans to the {C5-CH₃, C6-CH₃} pair.\n        *   **Exo Addition (Thermodynamically Favored):** The substituents of the dienophile are oriented trans to the \"in\" groups of the diene (and thus cis to the \"out\" groups). This would place all four substituents {C1-OH, C4-CH₃, C5-CH₃, C6-CH₃} on the same face of the ring (all cis).\n\n*   **Assigning Stereochemistry (R/S):** We must find which product matches the given options. Let's analyze the **exo product**, where all four substituents are cis. We can draw this with all four groups on wedges and the corresponding H atoms on dashes.\n\n    1.  **C1:** Priorities: -OH > -C2 > -C6 > -H. With H in the back, the sequence 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise. **C1 is S.**\n    2.  **C4:** Priorities: -C3 > -C5 > -CH₃ > -H. With H in the back, the sequence 1→2→3 is clockwise. **C4 is R.**\n    3.  **C5:** Priorities: -C6 > -C4 > -CH₃ > -H. With H in the back, the sequence 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise. **C5 is S.**\n    4.  **C6:** Priorities: -C1 > -C5 > -CH₃ > -H. With H in the back, the sequence 1→2→3 is clockwise. **C6 is R.**\n\n*   The predicted configuration for the exo product is **(1S,4R,5S,6R)**. This perfectly matches option B. While the endo product is usually the major kinetic product, the exo product is a possible thermodynamic product and its stereochemistry matches one of the answers.\n\nTherefore, Compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
