    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the conserved quantity:** In this system, the total energy is conserved. The total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy ($K$) and the potential energy ($U$).\n\n2.  **Formulate the energy expressions:**\n    *   The potential energy for a spring system obeying Hooke's Law ($F=-kx$) is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where we set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Write the total energy equation:**\n    The total conserved energy of the system at any point in its motion is:\n    $E_{total} = K + U(x) = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n4.  **Analyze the system at the point of maximum amplitude:**\n    The maximum amplitude is the point of maximum displacement, $x=A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops before reversing its direction.\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Velocity: $v = 0$\n    *   Since $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is $K = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is therefore $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n5.  **Analyze the system at the point of maximum speed:**\n    The maximum speed, $v_{max}$, occurs when the mass passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$), where the potential energy is zero.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$\n    *   Velocity: $v = v_{max}$\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   The potential energy is $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n6.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy:**\n    The total energy is constant throughout the motion. Therefore, we can equate the total energy at the maximum amplitude with the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n7.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    Our goal is to find $v_{max}$. We'll first solve the equation for $\\gamma_{max}$.\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we rearrange the equation. First, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Next, square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
