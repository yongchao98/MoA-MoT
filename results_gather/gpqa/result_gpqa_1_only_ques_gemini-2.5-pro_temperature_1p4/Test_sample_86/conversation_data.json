    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Analyze the molecular formula and structural features:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents (C6H4-R1-R2). The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain a total of 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the structure of the substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbons.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The only common functional group that fits this description is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Combining these pieces, the compound must be a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula would be C8H7XO.\n\n3.  **Determine the substitution pattern:**\n    *   The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   Let's consider the symmetry. A para (1,4) substitution pattern results in a highly symmetrical molecule. This symmetry leads to a simple 1H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region, typically consisting of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. Ortho and meta patterns would result in more complex splitting with four distinct signals in the aromatic region.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be deshielded and appear as a doublet further downfield (approx. 7.8-8.0 ppm). The two protons ortho to the halogen will be less deshielded and appear as another doublet slightly more upfield (approx. 7.5-7.7 ppm). Each doublet will integrate to 2H. So, we expect a signal like: `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` in the 7-8 ppm range.\n    *   **Acetyl Group Protons:** The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent is adjacent to a carbonyl group and not coupled to any other protons. It will appear as a singlet integrating to 3H. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm. So, we expect a signal like: `(3H, s)` around 2.3 ppm.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The chemical shifts are too low. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   It also shows a singlet integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm, which is characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. While this structure would have 8 carbons and a carbonyl (e.g., 4-(chloromethyl)benzaldehyde), the problem specifies an \"aromatic-halogen bond,\" meaning the halogen is attached directly to the ring. In 4-(chloromethyl)benzaldehyde, the halogen is attached to a methyl group (a benzylic position), which is not an aromatic-halogen bond. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region, which contradicts the \"di-substituted\" description. The integration and splitting patterns are inconsistent with the proposed structure. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only NMR data that correctly represents a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
