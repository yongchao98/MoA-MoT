    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars are detectable by ESPRESSO under the given conditions.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Detection Limit of ESPRESSO\n\nFirst, we need to find the limiting apparent visual magnitude (V magnitude) that ESPRESSO can observe to achieve the specified signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n*   **Instrument:** ESPRESSO on one 8m VLT (this is the 1-UT mode).\n*   **Requirement:** Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) ≥ 10 per binned pixel.\n*   **Exposure Time:** 1 hour (3600 seconds).\n\nAccording to the official ESPRESSO overview page provided:\n\"The limiting V magnitudes for 1 hour of exposure in 1-UT mode are ... V=16.5 mag (S/N=10) ... for a G2V star.\"\n\nTherefore, a star is considered **detectable** if its apparent visual magnitude (m_V) is **≤ 16.5**. We must also consider if the star is visible from the Paranal Observatory.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory Latitude:** Approximately 24.6° South. A star is generally considered observable if its declination (DEC) is less than approximately +45° to +50° (to avoid observing too close to the northern horizon).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Star\n\n#### a) Canopus\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m_V):** -0.74 (one of the brightest stars in the sky).\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -52° 41'. This is in the southern celestial hemisphere and is easily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Analysis:** Since -0.74 is much less than 16.5, Canopus is extremely bright and easily detectable.\n*   **Result:** **Detectable**\n\n#### b) Polaris\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m_V):** +1.98.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** +89° 15'. Polaris is the North Star.\n*   **Analysis:** Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere (24.6° S). Polaris, being very close to the North Celestial Pole, is never visible from this location as it is always below the horizon.\n*   **Result:** **Not Detectable**\n\n#### c) Star at 10 pc distance\n*   **Absolute V magnitude (M_V):** 15 mag\n*   **Distance (d):** 10 pc\n*   **Calculation:** We need to find the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * (1) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15\n*   **Visibility:** The star has a declination of 0°, which is on the celestial equator. This is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Analysis:** Since m_V = 15 is less than 16.5, the star is bright enough.\n*   **Result:** **Detectable**\n\n#### d) Star at 200 pc distance\n*   **Absolute V magnitude (M_V):** 15 mag\n*   **Distance (d):** 200 pc\n*   **Calculation:** `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * (2.301) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 11.505 - 5\n    *   m_V = 21.505\n*   **Analysis:** Since m_V = 21.5 is greater than 16.5, the star is too faint to be detected under the specified conditions.\n*   **Result:** **Not Detectable**\n\n#### e) Star at 5 pc distance\n*   **Absolute V magnitude (M_V):** 15 mag\n*   **Distance (d):** 5 pc\n*   **Calculation:** `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * (0.699) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 3.495 - 5\n    *   m_V = 13.495\n*   **Analysis:** Since m_V = 13.5 is less than 16.5, the star is bright enough.\n*   **Result:** **Detectable**\n\n#### f) Star at 50 pc distance\n*   **Absolute V magnitude (M_V):** 15 mag\n*   **Distance (d):** 50 pc\n*   **Calculation:** `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * (1.699) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 8.495 - 5\n    *   m_V = 18.495\n*   **Analysis:** Since m_V = 18.5 is greater than 16.5, the star is too faint.\n*   **Result:** **Not Detectable**\n\n### Step 3: Count the Detectable Stars\n\nLet's tally the results:\n*   a) Canopus: **Yes**\n*   b) Polaris: **No** (not visible)\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Yes**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **No** (too faint)\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Yes**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **No** (too faint)\n\nThere are a total of **3** detectable stars. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
