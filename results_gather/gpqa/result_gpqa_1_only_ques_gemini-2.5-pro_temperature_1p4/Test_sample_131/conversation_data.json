    "This problem requires us to determine which two compounds, from a list of four, are present in a 1:1 mixture, based on its 1H NMR spectrum. Let's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each compound first. All four compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n**1. Analysis of Individual Compounds:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single singlet. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, 5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single singlet. Integration: 4 x 3H = 12H.\n    *   **Expected Spectrum:** One 2H singlet (aromatic) and one 12H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single singlet. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n    *   **Expected Spectrum:** One 2H singlet (aromatic) and three singlets in the aliphatic region with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent proton neighbors. They will appear as a single singlet. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n    *   **Expected Spectrum:** One 2H singlet (aromatic) and two singlets in the aliphatic region with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, producing one singlet. Integration: 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (-CH2-) protons will be a quartet (split by the -CH3 group), and the methyl (-CH3) protons will be a triplet (split by the -CH2- group).\n    *   **Expected Spectrum:** One 4H singlet (aromatic), one 4H quartet (aliphatic), and one 6H triplet (aliphatic).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Mixture Spectrum:**\n\nThe observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\nFirst, let's look at the types of signals. The problem states that all signals observed are **singlets**. This immediately eliminates **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which would produce a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nWe are left with combinations of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers. Let's examine the remaining options. We have a 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and a triplet.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB has a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB has a 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets of equal intensity (2H:2H ratio = 1:1). This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB has one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB has two singlets (each 6H). In a mixture, we would see a total of three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also matches the data.\n    *   **This option perfectly explains the observed spectrum.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both compounds give a 2H singlet, so the mixture would show two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This is consistent.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The total number of signals would be 1 + 3 = 4. This contradicts the observation of only three signals, unless there is an accidental overlap of two signals. To get a 2:1:1 ratio, the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB would have to overlap, giving a combined 6H signal, resulting in signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H (ratio 2:1:1). However, this requires a coincidental overlap, making this explanation less likely than option B, which fits directly.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both compounds give a 2H singlet, so the mixture would show two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This is consistent.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB has two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB has three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The total number of signals would be 2 + 3 = 5. This contradicts the observation of three signals, and no simple overlap scenario creates the 2:1:1 ratio observed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option B) is the only choice that directly and simply accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
