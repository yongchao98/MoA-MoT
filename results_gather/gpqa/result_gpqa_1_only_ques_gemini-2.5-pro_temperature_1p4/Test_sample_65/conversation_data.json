    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators, suppressed by a high-energy scale Î›. These operators are constructed using the fields of the SM and must respect the fundamental symmetries of the underlying theory. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is formulated as a relativistic quantum field theory. A core assumption is that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. Therefore, all terms in the Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators, must be Lorentz scalars. This symmetry is fundamental to the construction of SMEFT.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry (boosts and rotations) plus spacetime translations. Invariance under translations ensures the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, this is a fundamental spacetime symmetry that is assumed to be respected in SMEFT.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is *not* a symmetry of the Standard Model; it is violated by the weak interaction, as described by the complex phase in the CKM matrix. Since the SM itself violates CP, there is no reason to impose CP symmetry on the higher-dimensional SMEFT operators. In fact, SMEFT provides new, independent ways to violate CP symmetry, which are subjects of active experimental searches.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories. It states that any such theory is automatically invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n*   1. Lorentz Symmetry - **Yes**\n*   2. Poincare symmetry - **Yes**\n*   3. CP symmetry - **No**\n*   4. CPT symmetry - **Yes**\n\nThis corresponds to symmetries 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
