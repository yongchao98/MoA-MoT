    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is the parent structure, a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH). By IUPAC convention for cyclic carboxylic acids, the carbon of the ring to which the -COOH group is attached is numbered C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nThe numbering of the ring starts at the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) and proceeds in the direction that gives the lowest locants to the multiple bonds and then the substituents.\n\nThe structure has the following features contributing to its index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation:\n1.  One ring (the cyclohexene ring): IHD = 1\n2.  One carbon-carbon double bond in the ring (the \"-3-ene\" part): IHD = 1\n3.  One carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2): IHD = 1\n4.  One carbon-oxygen double bond in the formyl group (-CHO): IHD = 1\n5.  One carbon-oxygen double bond in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH): IHD = 1\n\nAdding these up, the total IHD of the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nFor confirmation, let's find the molecular formula of the reactant and calculate its IHD.\n*   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): 1 on C1, 1 on C2, 1 on C3, 1 on C4, 1 on C5, 2 on C6, 1 in -COOH, 1 in -CHO, 3 in -CH=CH2. Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\nThe IHD formula is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2). (Oxygen atoms do not affect the IHD calculation).\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This matches our structural analysis.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the reaction and determine the product's structure.**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the ring is reduced to a single bond (hydrogenated).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond (the vinyl group becomes an ethyl group, -CH2CH3).\n\nThe carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact. The reaction removes all pi bonds and oxygen atoms, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\nThe product will be a substituted **cyclohexane** (since the ring C=C is reduced). The substituents will be two methyl groups and one ethyl group. The carbon skeleton is C10.\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nThe IHD of a molecule is the sum of its rings and pi bonds.\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of pi bonds (C=C, Câ‰¡C, C=O, etc.) = 0 (since it is a fully saturated alkane)\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the molecular formula of the product.\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\nSo, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\nUsing the IHD formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods give the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
