    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as `E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, with rest-masses m₁ and m₂. They are moving, so they have both rest-mass energy and kinetic energy.\n\n### 2. Determine the Masses of the Fragments and the Energy Released\n\nThe problem states:\n1.  One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. Let's assume m₁ is the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n2.  The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\nFrom these, we can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies is `(m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We also have `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`.\n*   Substituting the second relation into the first: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n*   This gives `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`, so `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n*   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy:\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn this approximation, we use classical formulas for kinetic energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude. Let `p₁` and `p₂` be the momenta. Then `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   For the two fragments: `T₁ = p² / (2m₁)` and `T₂ = p² / (2m₂)`.\n*   We can find the ratio of their kinetic energies: `T₁ / T₂ = (p² / (2m₁)) / (p² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `T₁ / T₂ = 1/2`, which means `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n*   We know the total kinetic energy is `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T₂ = 2T₁`: `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`, so `3T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the classically calculated kinetic energy is **`T₁_classical = 1 GeV`**.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the Correct Relativistic Formula\n\nNow, we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n    The total energy E is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy, `E = T + mc²`.\n    Substituting this, we get `(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n    Expanding this gives `T² + 2T(mc²) + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, which simplifies to `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum magnitude `p` is the same for both fragments, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n*   Therefore: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Now, we substitute the known values:\n    *   `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n    *   `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`\n*   The equation becomes:\n    `T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = (9 + 594) + (-6 - 198)T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Now, solve for T₁:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   So, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is **`T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`**.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value and the classical approximation.\n*   `ΔT₁ = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `ΔT₁ = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   `ΔT₁ = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
