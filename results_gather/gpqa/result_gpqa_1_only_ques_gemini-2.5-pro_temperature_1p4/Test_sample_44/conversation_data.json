    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the energies of the system.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nIn this system, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin up or -1/2 for spin down). Therefore, each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state energy of the four-particle system, we must place the particles in the lowest possible single-particle energy levels.\n*   The first two particles fill the n=1 level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The next two particles fill the n=2 level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state (E_gs) is the sum of the energies of these four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n$E_{gs} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   The ground state configuration has particles in n=1 and n=2.\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nThe new configuration for the first excited state is:\n*   Two particles in the n=1 level.\n*   One particle in the n=2 level.\n*   One particle in the n=3 level.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state ($E_{1st}$) is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the next possible configuration with the lowest energy above the first excited state. We can consider excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy: (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy: (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy: (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the state with energy 18E is the second lowest excited state.\n\nThe total energy of the second excited state ($E_{2nd}$) is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
