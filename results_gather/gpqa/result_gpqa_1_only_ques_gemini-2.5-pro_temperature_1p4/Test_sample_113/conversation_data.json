    "The user wants to identify the correct reagents, A and B, for two separate reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n*   **Reactant:** butan-2-one, a ketone.\n*   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, a cyanohydrin.\n*   **Reaction type:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n    1.  The cyanide ion (from NaCN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one, breaking the C=O pi bond and forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    2.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion must be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin.\n*   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   **H₃O⁺** represents a hydronium ion, which is a source of protons in an acidic aqueous solution. Adding acid (often in a workup step) is the standard procedure to complete the cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **NaHSO₃** (sodium bisulfite) is a different reagent that also adds to carbonyl compounds to form bisulfite addition products. It is not used for cyanohydrin synthesis.\n*   **Conclusion for Reagent A:** A must be **H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. This molecule contains a nitrile functional group (-C≡N).\n*   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Reaction type:** The transformation from a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a hydrolysis reaction. This hydrolysis is typically catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, usually with heating.\n*   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of the nitrile in the presence of water (H₂O).\n    *   **HCl** (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   **CH₃COOH** (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it can act as an acid catalyst, it is much less effective than a strong mineral acid like HCl for this type of hydrolysis, which usually requires harsh conditions.\n*   **Conclusion for Reagent B:** The most suitable and standard reagent for this transformation is **HCl**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Reagent A = H₃O⁺\n*   Reagent B = HCl\n\nMatching these reagents with the given options:\nA) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\nB) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\nC) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\nD) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
