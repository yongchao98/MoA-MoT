    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to decide which one is a better target for observation. The planet with the higher transit probability is preferred.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Transit Probability:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of a transit occurring is the ratio of the host star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   `Probability (P_transit) = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio of Probabilities:** We want to find the ratio of the probability for Planet_1 (`Prob_1`) to the probability for Planet_2 (`Prob_2`).\n    *   `Prob_1 = R_s1 / a_1`\n    *   `Prob_2 = R_s2 / a_2`\n    *   Ratio = `Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n\n4.  **Incorporate Known Information:** The problem states that both host stars have the same radii.\n    *   `R_s1 = R_s2`\n    *   Therefore, the `R_s` terms cancel out in the ratio:\n        `Prob_1 / Prob_2 = a_2 / a_1`\n    *   This shows that the planet with the smaller orbit (smaller `a`) has the higher transit probability.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** To find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`, we use Kepler's Third Law. For a planet orbiting a star, where the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass (`m_p << M_s`), the law can be written as:\n    *   `P^2 / a^3 ∝ 1 / M_s`\n    *   Rearranging to solve for `a`, we get: `a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2`\n    *   Therefore, `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can write the ratio `a_2 / a_1` in terms of the stellar masses (`M_s`) and orbital periods (`P`).\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Given Relationships:**\n    *   The mass of Star_1 is twice the mass of Star_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`\n    *   The period of Planet_2 is three times the period of Planet_1: `P_2 = 3 * P_1`\n    *   Substitute these into the equation:\n        `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P_1)^2) / ((2 * M_s2) * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P_1^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   Cancel the common terms (`M_s2` and `P_1^2`):\n        `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65096...`\n    *   Since `Prob_1 / Prob_2 = a_2 / a_1`, we have:\n        `Prob_1 / Prob_2 ≈ 1.65`\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
