    "Here is a step-by-step explanation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the precision with which its energy can be known. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    Here, Δt can be interpreted as the lifetime (τ) of the state, and ΔE is the inherent uncertainty or \"width\" of the energy level. A state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy, but rather a range of possible energies. This width is often called the natural linewidth (Γ). For practical calculations, we use the relation:\n    Γ ≈ ħ / τ\n    where Γ is the energy width, τ is the lifetime, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:** We need to find the energy uncertainty (Γ) for each state. It's convenient to use the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s):\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For the first state (E1):**\n        Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        Energy width Γ₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For the second state (E2):**\n        Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        Energy width Γ₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their respective energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the energy distributions of the two states will overlap so much that they appear as a single, broad level. The state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width (Γ₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV), and this larger width is the limiting factor for resolution.\n\n    Therefore, the condition to resolve the levels is:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > Γ₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:** Now we check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV:  10⁻⁴ is much greater than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This energy difference is large enough for the levels to be clearly resolved.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV:  10⁻⁹ is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would completely overlap.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: 10⁻¹¹ is even smaller and not resolvable.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV:  10⁻⁸ (or 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would still overlap significantly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only energy difference large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
