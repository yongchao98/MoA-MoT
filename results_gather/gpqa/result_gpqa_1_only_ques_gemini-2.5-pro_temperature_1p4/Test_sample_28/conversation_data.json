    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein. The most effective way to create a non-functional protein is to introduce a mutation that stops protein synthesis prematurely (a nonsense mutation) or one that changes the reading frame of the gene (a frameshift mutation).\n\nLet's analyze the genetic code of the intact gene and each mutant by reading the DNA sequence in groups of three (codons), starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\nSequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... TGA-3’`\nAmino Acids: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine - Threonine ... STOP\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant in the same way.\n\n**Mutant 1:**\nSequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ... TGA-3’`\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n*   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). The original `TTT` also codes for Phe, so this part is a silent mutation.\n*   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). The original `CTC` coded for Leucine. This is a missense mutation, which changes one amino acid.\n*   **Effect:** The resulting protein has one amino acid changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might affect protein function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\nSequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ... TGA-3’`\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n*   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n*   `TAA` -> **STOP codon**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a nonsense mutation. The ribosome will stop translation after adding only two amino acids. The resulting protein will be just a tiny dipeptide (Met-Phe) and will be completely non-functional. This is a very reliable way to eliminate the final compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\nSequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ... TGA-3’` (Note: Compared to the intact gene, this sequence appears to have a single base insertion, 'T', after the second codon `TTT`. `ATG TTT T ACG CTG...`. This would cause a frameshift mutation, which also reliably knocks out a gene. However, let's also analyze it as written.)\n*   If we analyze it simply by its codons: `ATG` (Met), `TTT` (Phe), `TAC` (Tyr). This would be a missense mutation (Leucine to Tyrosine), similar to Mutant 1. Given the ambiguity, the clear stop codon in Mutant 2 is a more definitive answer.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\nSequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... TGA-3’`\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n*   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n*   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a missense mutation (Leucine to Tyrosine).\n*   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n*   `ACT` -> Threonine (Thr). The original `GGT` coded for Glycine. This is another missense mutation.\n*   **Effect:** This mutant has at least two amino acid changes. While this increases the chance of disrupting function compared to a single change, it is still not as certain as a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene sequence (at the third codon). This will lead to a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This type of mutation is the most likely among the choices to completely eliminate the function of the gene and thus the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
