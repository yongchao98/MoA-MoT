    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at the specified points of the titration.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial acetic acid solution (20.00 cm³) is diluted with water (20.00 cm³). We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n\n*   M1 (initial concentration) = 0.05 M\n*   V1 (initial volume) = 20.00 cm³\n*   V2 (final volume) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   M2 (final concentration) = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    At 25% titration, the ratio of the amount of conjugate base formed to the amount of weak acid remaining is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    [A⁻]/[HA] = 1/3\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH = 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.\n\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n1.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH added and the total volume:**\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = M * V = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.0 cm³\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.0 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.0 cm³ = 0.050 L\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction:**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n4.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
