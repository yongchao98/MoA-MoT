    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in the `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = P(N1) * P(N2) * (-1)^L_i`. Since nucleons have intrinsic parity `+1` and `L_i = 0`, the initial parity is `P_i = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system `(NN)_f` and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   The final NN state is described by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n*   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is emitted in an angular momentum state `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, ...).\n\nWe must apply three main principles:\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total initial angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The total final angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle's orbital angular momentum `l_X`. For the total to remain zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the final particles and the parity of their relative orbital motion. `P_f = P(NN)_f * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`. The parity of the final NN state is `P(NN)_f = (-1)^L_f`. So, `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i = +1`), we must have:\n    `-(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = +1`\n    `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`\n    This requires the sum `L_f + l_X` to be an **odd** number.\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. It also stipulates that we consider the case where the final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n    Substituting `T_f = 0` into the equation gives:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This implies `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition:**\n1.  `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  `J_f = l_X`.\n3.  `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n3.  `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n    This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **FAIL.** The Pauli principle condition for a `T=0` state is violated.\n    This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n3.  `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n    This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1 = 7` => `S_f=3`, `L_f=2` (D-wave), `J_f=1`. (Note: S=3 is physically impossible for two nucleons, but we will strictly apply the given rules).\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n3.  `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n    According to the explicit rules given in the problem, this transition is **permitted**. The physical impossibility of the `7D1` state is an external fact not required for the logic specified.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only transition that violates the rules explicitly provided (Pauli statistics, conservation of angular momentum, and conservation of parity) is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
