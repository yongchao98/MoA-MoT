    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of Compound X from the given IR and ¹H NMR data.**\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet is in the typical range for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, indicating it is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, suggesting it is adjacent to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n    *   **Alkyl group analysis (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to at least two different types of protons.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton suggests a methine group (-CH-) adjacent to several protons and attached to the benzene ring (explaining its downfield shift).\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The pieces (-CH₂CH₃ and -CHCH₃) combine to form a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This structure is consistent with all the splitting patterns and integrations.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a *para* arrangement. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reaction and the final product.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X)\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)\n*   **Reaction:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to alkanes. In this case, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule (the benzene ring and the sec-butyl group) will remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Transformation: -COOH → -CH₃\n    *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our determined final product.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
