    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Governing Physics**\n\nThe problem asks for the change in the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels at two different temperatures. In a stellar photosphere under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of atoms in different energy states is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n**2. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in levels 2 and 1.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels (which are constant for this transition).\n*   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**3. Define the Two Scenarios**\n\n*   **Scenario A (No Spots):** The temperature is T_A = 6000 K.\n    The ratio is R_A = (N₂/N₁)_A = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_A))\n\n*   **Scenario B (With Spots):** The temperature is T_B = 5500 K.\n    The ratio is R_B = (N₂/N₁)_B = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_B))\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of the transition is related to its wavelength (λ) by the formula ΔE = hc/λ. A useful constant for this calculation is hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm.\n\n*   Given wavelength λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm.\n*   ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.563 eV.\n\n**5. Determine the Required Factor**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes *when the star does not have spots* compared to *when it does*. This means we need to calculate the ratio R_A / R_B.\n\nFactor = R_A / R_B = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_A)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_B)) ]\n\nThe statistical weight term (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_A)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_B))\n\nUsing the property of exponents (e^x / e^y = e^(x-y)):\n\nFactor = exp( -ΔE/(k*T_A) - (-ΔE/(k*T_B)) )\nFactor = exp( ΔE/k * (1/T_B - 1/T_A) )\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nNow, we plug in the numbers:\n\n*   ΔE = 8.563 eV\n*   k = 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T_A = 6000 K\n*   T_B = 5500 K\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term in the parentheses:\n(1/T_B - 1/T_A) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) K⁻¹\n= ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) K⁻¹\n= 500 / 33,000,000 K⁻¹\n= 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹ ≈ 1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹\n\nNow, let's calculate the full exponent:\nExponent = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_B - 1/T_A)\nExponent = (8.563 eV / 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) * (1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹)\nExponent ≈ (99374 K) * (1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹)\nExponent ≈ 1.505\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\nFactor = exp(1.505) ≈ 4.504\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<A>>>"
