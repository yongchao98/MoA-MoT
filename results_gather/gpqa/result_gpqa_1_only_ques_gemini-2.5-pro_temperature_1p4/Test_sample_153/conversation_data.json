    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown white solid.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 amu (assuming the most abundant isotopes).\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units higher than the molecular ion. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This specific ratio is a definitive indicator of the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid** that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Specifically, its position is consistent with the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*Conclusion from IR:* The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an aromatic ring.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield and is characteristic of the highly acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). It is a singlet because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, meaning there are four protons on the benzene ring. This implies the ring is disubstituted.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two electron-withdrawing groups (the known -COOH and the suspected -Cl) cause the aromatic protons to be shifted downfield.\n\n### 4. Synthesis of All Data\n1.  **MS:** Molecular Weight = 156, contains one Cl atom.\n2.  **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n3.  **¹H NMR:** Confirms the -COOH group and indicates a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting it all together, the unknown compound is a benzoic acid with a chlorine atom in the para (4) position. This is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check if this fits all the data:\n*   **Structure:** 4-chlorobenzoic acid\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n*   **Molecular Weight:** (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + 35.45 + (2 * 16.00) = 156.57 g/mol. This matches the m/z of 156.\n*   **IR and NMR features:** Perfectly match the analysis above.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
