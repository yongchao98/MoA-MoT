    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses, $M_{tot,1} / M_{tot,2}$.\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass ($M_{tot} = M_1 + M_2$) can be related to the orbital period ($P$) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves ($K_1$ and $K_2$). The governing equation, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\n$M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{P}{2 \\pi G \\sin^3 i} (K_1 + K_2)^3$\n\nwhere:\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both systems are \"eclipsing\". For eclipses to be observed, the orbital plane must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination angle $i$ is very close to 90Â°, and therefore $\\sin i \\approx 1$. Making this assumption for both systems, the formula for the total mass simplifies to:\n\n$M_{tot} \\approx \\frac{P (K_1 + K_2)^3}{2 \\pi G}$\n\nWe can now find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to system_2. The constant term $2\\pi G$ will cancel out.\n\n$\\frac{M_{tot,1}}{M_{tot,2}} = \\frac{P_1 (K_{1,1} + K_{1,2})^3}{P_2 (K_{2,1} + K_{2,2})^3}$\n\nLet's plug in the given values for each system.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period ($P_1$) = 2 years\n*   Velocity amplitudes ($K_{1,1}$, $K_{1,2}$) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes: $K_{1,1} + K_{1,2} = 10 + 5 = 15$ km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period ($P_2$) = 1 year\n*   Velocity amplitudes ($K_{2,1}$, $K_{2,2}$) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes: $K_{2,1} + K_{2,2} = 15 + 10 = 25$ km/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{M_{tot,1}}{M_{tot,2}} = \\frac{2 \\text{ years} \\times (15 \\text{ km/s})^3}{1 \\text{ year} \\times (25 \\text{ km/s})^3}$\n\nThe units cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{M_{tot,1}}{M_{tot,2}} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{15}{25}\\right)^3$\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n$\\frac{15}{25} = \\frac{3}{5}$\n\nSubstitute this back into the equation:\n\n$\\frac{M_{tot,1}}{M_{tot,2}} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^3 = 2 \\times \\frac{27}{125} = \\frac{54}{125}$\n\nTo compare with the given options, we convert the fraction to a decimal:\n\n$\\frac{54}{125} = 0.432$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4. Thus, system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
