    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Structure:** This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. The fusion is `cis`. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen points \"up\" (beta face).\n*   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are at C1, C3, and C4. A hydrogen is at C6.\n*   **Stereochemistry from the name:**\n    *   The problem provides the absolute configuration of all stereocenters. We don't need to determine them from scratch, but we must use them to understand the reaction's outcome. The key stereocenters for the reaction are the epoxide carbons: C1 (R) and C6 (S).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the soft nucleophile, methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem states two key rules for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon where the nucleophile adds. This is a characteristic Sₙ2-type reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon center (bonded to C2, C6, a methyl group, and the epoxide oxygen).\n*   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon center (bonded to C1, C5, a hydrogen, and the epoxide oxygen).\n*   Comparing the two, C1 is significantly more sterically hindered than C6 due to the presence of the methyl group.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophile (Me⁻) will attack **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and Numbering**\n\n*   The Me⁻ attacks C6, and the C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after protonation during workup, becomes an -OH group.\n*   The original cyclohexane C-C framework remains intact.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol. It has the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and a new methyl group at C6. The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n*   **IUPAC Numbering:** The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant. To assign the lowest possible locants to the methyl groups, we number the ring from C1 towards the original C6.\n    *   Product C1 = Reactant C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   Product C2 = Reactant C6 (has the new -Me)\n    *   Product C3 = Reactant C5\n    *   Product C4 = Reactant C4 (has -Me)\n    *   Product C5 = Reactant C3 (has -Me)\n    *   Product C6 = Reactant C2\n*   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2-dimethyl implies attack at C1).\n\n**5. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Untouched Centers:** The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 of the reactant are not involved in the bond-breaking/forming part of the reaction. Their configurations are retained.\n    *   Reactant C1 is (R) → Product C1 is **(R)**.\n    *   Reactant C4 is (R) → Product C4 is **(R)**.\n    *   Reactant C3 is (R) → Product C5 is **(R)**.\n*   **Center of Attack:** The stereocenter at C6 undergoes Sₙ2 attack, leading to **inversion of configuration**.\n    *   Reactant C6 has an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   The attack by Me⁻ inverts the stereocenter. We need to determine if the resulting configuration at product C2 is R or S.\n    *   This is not a simple S → R flip because the substituents, and thus their Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities, change. The leaving group is the epoxide oxygen, and the incoming group is methyl.\n    *   Let's analyze the transformation. The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6 from the face opposite the C6-O bond. This is an `anti` attack. The original substituent at C6 (a hydrogen) and the other ring connections are pushed to the opposite side (a Walden inversion).\n    *   Given the starting configuration C6(S), a rigorous analysis of the geometry before and after inversion (considering the change in CIP priorities where O is replaced by Me) shows that the new stereocenter at C2 in the product has an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   [Detailed check: Priorities at C6(reactant): O > C1 > C5 > H. With a standard representation, C6(S) means H is anti to the C6-O bond. After inversion, the new Me group takes this anti position, and H moves. Priorities at C2(product): C1 > C5 > Me > H. The inverted geometry with the new priority order results in an (S) assignment.]\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   Combining the stereochemical results:\n    *   C1 is (R)\n    *   C2 is (S)\n    *   C4 is (R)\n    *   C5 is (R)\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
