    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the solution:\n\n1.  **Assumption:** We assume that stars are distributed uniformly throughout three-dimensional space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it ρ (rho), is constant everywhere. ρ = (number of stars) / (volume).\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Spherical Shell:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the Sun. Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV ≈ 4πd² dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume: `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`.\n\n3.  **Relating Distance to Parallax:** The parallax (`plx`) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (`d`). The standard formula is `plx = 1/d`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds. From this, we can write `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Connecting the Differentials:** We need to find how the number of stars changes with parallax (`dN/d(plx)`), but our current expression is in terms of distance (`dN = 4πρd² dd`). We need to relate the differential `dd` to the differential `d(plx)`. We can do this using calculus.\n    *   Starting with `d = 1/plx`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   The negative sign simply means that as parallax increases, distance decreases. For our calculation of the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can write: `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitution and Final Result:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`.\n    *   Original equation: `dN = 4πρd² dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = 4πρ(1/plx)² dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`: `dN = 4πρ(1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms: `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Number per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the final equation:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\nSince `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is directly proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n`dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
