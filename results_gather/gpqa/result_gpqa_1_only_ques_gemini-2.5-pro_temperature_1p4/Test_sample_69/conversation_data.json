    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 4: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"**\n    *   This is a strong clue. We are looking for two gases (B and D) that react in a 1:1 molar ratio to form a liquid solvent (H).\n    *   A classic example of such a reaction is the formation of sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂):\n        SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l)\n    *   Sulfuryl chloride is a liquid at room temperature (b.p. 69 °C) and is used as a solvent and a chlorinating agent.\n    *   Therefore, we can tentatively identify {B, D} as the set {Cl₂, SO₂} and H as SO₂Cl₂.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 3: \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"**\n    *   This hydrolysis reaction is very revealing. The product C, upon reacting with water, must regenerate the starting solid A and also produce two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G).\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for B and D from step 1.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Let B = Cl₂ and D = SO₂.**\n        *   The strong acid F would almost certainly be hydrochloric acid (HCl), formed from the chlorine originating from B.\n        *   The weak acid G must come from the hydrolysis of a component of C that originated from A.\n        *   However, the clue states that A is *reformed*. If A was, for example, phosphorus (P₄), its chloride would hydrolyze to H₃PO₄ (a weak acid G) and HCl (F), but P₄ (A) would be consumed, not reformed. This creates a contradiction.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Let B = SO₂ and D = Cl₂.**\n        *   In this case, the acids F and G must come from the hydrolysis of the sulfur dioxide (SO₂) part of compound C.\n        *   Sulfur can form both a strong acid (sulfuric acid, H₂SO₄) and a weak acid (sulfurous acid, H₂SO₃). This typically involves a disproportionation or redox reaction during hydrolysis.\n        *   Critically, in this scenario, solid A can be regenerated because it acts as a core or substrate for the SO₂ ligands, which are then removed by water.\n        *   This scenario is self-consistent. So we will proceed with:\n            *   **B = SO₂** (gas)\n            *   **D = Cl₂** (gas)\n            *   **H = SO₂Cl₂** (solvent)\n            *   **F = H₂SO₄** (strong acid)\n            *   **G = H₂SO₃** (weak acid)\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1: \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"**\n    *   Using our assignments from step 2, this becomes:\n        A(s) + 8 SO₂(g) → C (bright red product)\n    *   And C hydrolyzes to reform A. This suggests C is an adduct or complex, perhaps of the form A·(SO₂)₈. We do not need to identify A to proceed, but we have a clear chemical framework.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2: \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"**\n    *   Substituting our identified species:\n        C + 2 Cl₂(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n    *   C is the red solid, which we believe is a complex of A and SO₂, e.g., A·(SO₂)₈.\n    *   The reaction is: A·(SO₂)₈(s) + 2 Cl₂(g) → E\n    *   The reactants are the complex and chlorine gas. The most logical reaction is the chlorination of the SO₂ ligands.\n    *   The reaction between SO₂ and Cl₂ produces sulfuryl chloride, SO₂Cl₂.\n    *   SO₂ + Cl₂ → SO₂Cl₂\n    *   Let's look at the stoichiometry. We have 2 equivalents of Cl₂. This suggests two of the SO₂ ligands react.\n        A·(SO₂)₈ + 2 Cl₂ → A·(SO₂)₆ + 2 SO₂Cl₂\n    *   This reaction produces two things. However, the phrasing \"produces the extremely hazardous product E\" implies E is a single substance. It is highly probable that the reaction simply displaces all the ligands and A, and the product of interest is sulfuryl chloride.\n    *   **E = SO₂Cl₂** (Sulfuryl Chloride)\n    *   Sulfuryl chloride is indeed a hazardous substance. It reacts violently with water and is corrosive and toxic. \"Extremely hazardous\" is a fitting description.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E.**\n    *   E has been identified as sulfuryl chloride, SO₂Cl₂.\n    *   The structure of SO₂Cl₂ has sulfur as the central atom, tetrahedrally coordinated to two oxygen atoms and two chlorine atoms.\n    *   The molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation that bisects the O-S-O and Cl-S-Cl angles.\n    *   It also has two perpendicular planes of symmetry (σᵥ). One plane contains the O-S-O atoms, and the other contains the Cl-S-Cl atoms.\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular σᵥ planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2v\nC) D∞h\nD) C2\n\nOur identified molecule E (SO₂Cl₂) has C2v symmetry, which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
