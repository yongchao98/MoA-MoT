    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physical System:**\n    The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a specific geometry (a spheroid with a symmetry axis along the z-axis). This system radiates electromagnetic waves. We are asked about the properties of this radiation in the radiation zone (far from the source).\n\n2.  **Model the Radiating Source:**\n    An oscillating charge distribution can be described by a multipole expansion. The lowest order and typically dominant term in this expansion is the electric dipole moment. Higher-order terms like the magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole also contribute, but their radiation is generally much weaker unless the lower-order terms are zero due to some symmetry.\n    The description of an \"oscillating charge distribution\" is generic. The simplest physical picture is that of positive and negative charges oscillating relative to each other along the axis of symmetry (the z-axis). This creates a time-varying electric dipole moment, $\\vec{p}(t) = p_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\hat{z}$. The \"spheroid shape\" and \"z-axis symmetry\" serve to define the axis for this dipole. We will assume this is the dominant form of radiation.\n\n3.  **Recall the Formula for Electric Dipole Radiation:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle ($\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}$) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{\\mu_0 p_0^2 \\omega^4}{32 \\pi^2 c} \\sin^2\\theta $$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between the dipole axis (z-axis) and the direction of observation.\n    We can write this as $\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = K \\sin^2\\theta$, where $K$ is a constant for a given frequency and dipole moment amplitude.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The radiated power per unit solid angle depends on the angle $\\theta$ as $\\sin^2\\theta$.\n    *   The power is maximum when $\\sin^2\\theta$ is maximum. The maximum value is 1, which occurs at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis).\n    *   The maximum power radiated, A, is therefore: $A = (\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega})_{max} = K \\cdot 1 = K$.\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at an angle $\\theta = 30^\\circ$.\n    *   At $\\theta = 30^\\circ$, the power is: $(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega})_{\\theta=30^\\circ} = K \\sin^2(30^\\circ)$.\n    *   We know that $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$. So, $\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n    *   The power at $30^\\circ$ is $K \\cdot (1/4) = A/4$.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power A is $(A/4) / A = 1/4$.\n\n    This result eliminates options C and D. We are left with A and B.\n\n5.  **Determine the Wavelength Dependence:**\n    The question asks for a possible form of the function $f(\\lambda, \\theta) = \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}$. We need to find its dependence on the wavelength $\\lambda$.\n    From the formula for dipole radiation, the power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency, $\\omega$:\n    $$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\omega^4 $$\n    The angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to the wavelength $\\lambda$ and the speed of light $c$ by $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi \\frac{c}{\\lambda}$.\n    Therefore, $\\omega \\propto 1/\\lambda$.\n    Substituting this into the power relation:\n    $$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto (1/\\lambda)^4 = \\lambda^{-4} $$\n    So, the radiated power per unit solid angle has a $\\lambda^{-4}$ dependence. This is characteristic of dipole radiation (and Rayleigh scattering).\n\n6.  **Combine the Results and Select the Correct Option:**\n    *   The fraction of maximum power at $\\theta=30^\\circ$ is 1/4.\n    *   The wavelength dependence is $\\lambda^{-4}$.\n\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-4}$ - Matches our findings.\n    B) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-3}$ - Incorrect wavelength dependence.\n    C) 1/2, $\\lambda^{-4}$ - Incorrect fraction.\n    D) 3/4, $\\lambda^{-6}$ - These values correspond to electric quadrupole radiation, which is a less dominant type of radiation.\n\nThe most plausible model for the given description is the electric dipole, leading to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
