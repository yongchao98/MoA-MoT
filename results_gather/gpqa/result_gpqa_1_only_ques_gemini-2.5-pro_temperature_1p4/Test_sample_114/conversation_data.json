    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\nWe have an electron (e⁻) and a positron (e⁺) moving towards each other along the horizontal x-axis. Let the electron move in the +x direction and the positron in the -x direction. Both particles have the same rest mass, denoted by $m_e$.\n\n**Electron (e⁻):**\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_e = 4$\n*   Total energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$\n*   To find the momentum, we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n*   $(p_e c)^2 = E_e^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = (4 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = 16(m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = 15(m_e c^2)^2$\n*   $p_e c = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2$. The momentum is in the +x direction.\n\n**Positron (e⁺):**\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_p = 2$\n*   Total energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$\n*   Momentum: $(p_p c)^2 = E_p^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = 3(m_e c^2)^2$\n*   $p_p c = \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2$. The momentum is in the -x direction.\n\n### 2. Apply Conservation of Energy\nThe total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron.\n$E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced. The problem states they have the same energy, let's call it $E_\\gamma$.\nThe total energy of the final state is:\n$E_{final} = E_{\\gamma 1} + E_{\\gamma 2} = 2E_\\gamma$.\n\nBy the conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n$6 m_e c^2 = 2E_\\gamma$\n$E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$\nSo, each photon has an energy of $3 m_e c^2$.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum before the collision is the vector sum of the individual momenta. Since they are on the x-axis:\n$\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p$\nIn terms of magnitudes (with direction indicated by sign):\n$p_{initial, x} = p_e - p_p$\n$p_{initial, x} c = p_e c - p_p c = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2 - \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2 = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c^2$.\nThe initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n\nFor the final state, we have two photons. For a photon, the magnitude of its momentum $p_\\gamma$ is related to its energy by $E_\\gamma = p_\\gamma c$.\nSo, for each photon: $p_\\gamma c = E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n\nThe problem states one photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This indicates that their momentum vectors are symmetric with respect to the horizontal (x-axis). Let $\\theta$ be the angle of the upper photon's direction with the x-axis, and $-\\theta$ be the angle for the lower photon.\n\nThe momentum vector for the first photon is $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma 1} = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta)$.\nThe momentum vector for the second photon is $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma 2} = (p_\\gamma \\cos(-\\theta), p_\\gamma \\sin(-\\theta)) = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, -p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta)$.\n\nThe total final momentum is the sum:\n$\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\gamma 1} + \\vec{p}_{\\gamma 2} = (2 p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, 0)$.\nThe y-components cancel out, conserving the momentum in the y-direction (which was initially zero).\n\nThe x-component of the final momentum is:\n$p_{final, x} = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta$.\n$p_{final, x} c = 2 (p_\\gamma c) \\cos\\theta = 2 (3 m_e c^2) \\cos\\theta = 6 m_e c^2 \\cos\\theta$.\n\nBy conservation of momentum in the x-direction, $p_{initial, x} c = p_{final, x} c$:\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2 \\cos\\theta$.\n\n### 4. Solve for the Angle\nWe can cancel $m_e c^2$ from both sides:\n$\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos\\theta$\n$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\nNow we calculate the value:\n*   $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.8730$\n*   $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.7321$\n*   $\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.8730 - 1.7321}{6} = \\frac{2.1409}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n\nNow, find the angle $\\theta$:\n$\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$.\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons. This is the angle between the vector at $\\theta$ and the vector at $-\\theta$, which is $2\\theta$.\nAngle between photons = $2\\theta = 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 172\nB) 138\nC) 74\nD) 96\n\nThe calculated value of 138.2° is extremely close to 138°.\n\n<<<B>>>"
