    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituents on the benzene ring (C6H5-) based on their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Activating, Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating (+I effect, hyperconjugation)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating (+I effect, hyperconjugation)\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** Halogens withdraw electron density via the inductive effect (-I), deactivating the ring, but donate electron density via resonance (+M), directing the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro)\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ester group)\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro group)\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxyl group)\n\n**2. Compare Para-Isomer Yields**\n\nThe question asks for the order of increasing yield of the *para*-isomer.\n*   The meta-directing groups (2, 4, 6) will produce very little para-isomer. The vast majority of the product will be the meta-isomer.\n*   The ortho, para-directing groups (1, 3, 5) will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer, along with the ortho-isomer.\n\nThis means the substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will come first in the sequence.\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directing Groups (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the small amount of ortho/para product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. The stronger the deactivating group, the less ortho/para product is formed.\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield will be the reverse of the deactivating strength.\n*   Yield of para-isomer: **C6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)**.\n    *   (4) -NO2 is the strongest deactivator, leading to the lowest para yield (typically <1%).\n    *   (6) -COOH is a strong deactivator, leading to a very low para yield.\n    *   (2) -COOC2H5 is also a strong deactivator, but slightly weaker than -COOH, leading to a slightly higher (but still low) para yield (typically a few percent).\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This ratio is influenced by:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** For halogens, the strong negative inductive effect (-I) deactivates the ortho position more than the para position, favoring para substitution.\n\nLet's compare them:\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 vs. 5) C6H5-C2H5**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance for the ethyl group leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to the ortho-isomer.\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for (1) is less than for (5): **(1) < (5)**.\n*   **Comparing with 3) C6H5-Cl**: The chloro group (-Cl) strongly deactivates the ortho positions due to its potent inductive effect (-I), which diminishes with distance. This effect strongly favors substitution at the para position, leading to a very high para-to-ortho ratio. The para yield for chlorobenzene bromination is typically very high (around 89%). This is generally higher than for toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (which is higher than toluene but usually less than for chlorobenzene).\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for (3) is the highest among this group.\n\n*   The order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)**.\n\n**5. Combine the Orders**\n\nNow we combine the two ranked groups. The para-isomer yield for any ortho, para-director is significantly higher than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
