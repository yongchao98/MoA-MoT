    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the Initial State |alpha>\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`. Let's call this unnormalized state `|alpha'>`.\n`|alpha'> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`\n\nIn the standard basis where `|up> = [[1], [0]]` and `|down> = [[0], [1]]`, the vector representation is:\n`|alpha'> = [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\nTo normalize the state, we first calculate the squared norm `<alpha'|alpha'>`:\n`<alpha'|` is the conjugate transpose of `|alpha'>`: `[(1-i), (2+i)]`.\n\n`<alpha'|alpha'> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`<alpha'|alpha'> = (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) = (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is `N = 1 / sqrt(<alpha'|alpha'>) = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nThe normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * |alpha'> = (1/sqrt(7)) * ( (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down> )`\nIn vector form:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\n### 2. Determine the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `0` otherwise. In the `|up>`, `|down>` basis, this gives the matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(hbar/2)` times the Pauli matrix `σ_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`λ`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n`λ₁ = +hbar/2`\n`λ₂ = -hbar/2`\n\nNow we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   **For `λ₁ = +hbar/2`**:\n    `[[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * [[c₁], [c₂]] = (hbar/2) * [[c₁], [c₂]]`\n    This gives `(hbar/2)c₂ = (hbar/2)c₁`, which simplifies to `c₁ = c₂`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[[1], [1]]`.\n    The normalized eigenvector `|v₁>` is `(1/sqrt(1²+1²)) * [[1], [1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [1]]`.\n    So, `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For `λ₂ = -hbar/2`**:\n    `[[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * [[c₁], [c₂]] = (-hbar/2) * [[c₁], [c₂]]`\n    This gives `(hbar/2)c₂ = (-hbar/2)c₁`, which simplifies to `c₂ = -c₁`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[[1], [-1]]`.\n    The normalized eigenvector `|v₂>` is `(1/sqrt(1²+(-1)²)) * [[1], [-1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [-1]]`.\n    So, `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|v_i>` is given by `P(λ_i) = |<v_i|alpha>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability for `λ₁ = +hbar/2`**:\n    `<v₁| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = ((1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]) * ((1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]])`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (3) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P(+hbar/2) = |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability for `λ₂ = -hbar/2`**:\n    `<v₂| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = ((1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]) * ((1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]])`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1+i-2+i) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1+2i)`\n    `P(-hbar/2) = |(-1+2i)/sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²) / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**. (Check: 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1).\n\n### 4. Find the Average (Expectation) Value of A\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = Σ λ_i * P(λ_i) = λ₁*P(λ₁) + λ₂*P(λ₂)`\n    `<A> = (+hbar/2)*(9/14) + (-hbar/2)*(5/14)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7)`\n    `<A> = hbar/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`**\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]] = (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = ( (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1-i), (2+i)] ) * ( (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]] )`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ] = (hbar/14) * [2]`\n    `<A> = 2*hbar/14 = hbar/7`\n\nBoth methods yield an average value of **hbar/7**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is hbar/7. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
