    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The formula for calculating the Degrees of Unsaturation is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n*   This leaves one additional degree of unsaturation, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is too high for a simple amide (which is typically < 1700 cm⁻¹) but is in the correct range for an ester (C=O-O). An ester carbonyl conjugated with an aromatic ring typically appears around 1715-1730 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2 group (2+1=3 peaks). The chemical shift is typical for a methyl (-CH3) group. This is the -CH3 part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet (q) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH3 group (3+1=4 peaks). The downfield shift (~4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene (-CH2-) group attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen, specifically in an ester (-CO-O-**CH2**-). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets (d) and each integrates to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern (two doublets of equal integration) is the classic signature of a **para-disubstituted** (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively shielded (upfield), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like -NH2).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly deshielded (downfield), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester -COOEt).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a primary **amine group (-NH2)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: An amide, not an ester. Inconsistent with IR C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: A meta-substituted amide. Inconsistent with NMR aromatic pattern and IR C=O frequency.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be CH3-CH2-CO-, not -O-CH2-CH3. The NMR signal for the -CH2- group would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the data: C9H11NO2, primary amine, conjugated ester, ethyl group attached to ester oxygen, and a para-disubstituted aromatic ring with appropriate electronic effects.\n\n<<<D>>>"
