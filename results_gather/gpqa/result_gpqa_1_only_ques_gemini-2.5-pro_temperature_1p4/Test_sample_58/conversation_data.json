    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the pH of the solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH) - a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) - a strong acid:**\n    *   HCl dissociates completely: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from HCl = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2) - a strong base:**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻,\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Determine the net reaction.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons. It will neutralize the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first, and then the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Total moles of acidic protons = (moles of H⁺ from HCl) + (moles of CH3COOH)\n*   Total moles of acidic protons = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   Total moles of base (OH⁻) = **0.180 mol**\n\nNow, compare the total moles of acid and base to see which is in excess.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ (0.180 mol) > Moles of acidic protons (0.130 mol)\n*   This means the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n**3. Calculate the moles of excess OH⁻.**\n\nThe excess OH⁻ is the amount remaining after all the acid has been neutralized.\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = (Initial moles of OH⁻) - (Total moles of acidic protons)\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻.**\n\nFirst, find the total volume of the final solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\nNow, calculate the molarity of the excess OH⁻. The pH of the solution is primarily determined by this concentration of strong base.\n*   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n\n**5. Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167)\n    *   pOH ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH is: pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38\n    *   pH = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
