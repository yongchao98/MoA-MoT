    "To determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the structure and symmetry elements of each molecule. A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has a C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) Triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-iPr). The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar.\n*   **Symmetry:** There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms. However, due to the steric bulk of the isopropyl groups, they twist out of the B(O)3 plane to minimize repulsion. This creates a propeller-like shape. While it retains the C3 axis, it loses the horizontal mirror plane (σh). Its point group is C3. Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has a triphenylene core, which is a large, flat polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with D3h symmetry. Three cyclic anhydride groups are fused symmetrically to the outer rings of the triphenylene.\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to severe steric hindrance between the carbonyl groups of adjacent anhydride rings, the molecule is forced to twist into a non-planar, helical (propeller-like) conformation. This twisted structure possesses a C3 axis and three C2 axes perpendicular to it, but it lacks any mirror planes, including a σh plane. The point group of this molecule is D3. Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring to which three cyclic anhydride groups are fused. The fusions occur across the C1-C2, C3-C4, and C5-C6 bonds of the benzene ring.\n*   **Symmetry:**\n    *   The entire molecule is planar. The benzene ring and the three fused anhydride rings all lie in the same plane.\n    *   There is a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. A 120° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The presence of both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane means the molecule belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**D) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has two bridgehead atoms (one nitrogen, one carbon) connected by three two-carbon (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Symmetry:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three bridges.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the C3v point group. Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only molecule with C3h symmetry is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
