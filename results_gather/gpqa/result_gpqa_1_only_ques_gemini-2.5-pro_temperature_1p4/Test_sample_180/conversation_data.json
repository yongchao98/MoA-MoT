    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Understand the Scenario:** The problem describes a hypothetical situation where the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain reaction in the Sun's core has stopped. We are asked to find the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands as observed on Earth. The time delay of \"about 8 and a half minutes\" confirms that the effects of this change in the Sun's core are just now reaching us, as neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Identify the Neutrino Sources:** We need to know which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands.\n\n    *   **pp-I Chain:** Produces `pp` neutrinos with energies up to 420 keV. These are below both of our energy bands.\n    *   **pp-II Chain:** This branch produces monoenergetic neutrinos from electron capture on Beryllium-7 (`7Be`). The vast majority (90%) of these neutrinos have an energy of **862 keV**. This falls squarely in our **band 2 (800-900 keV)**. The pp-II chain is explicitly stated to be unaffected.\n    *   **pp-III Chain:** This branch produces Boron-8 (`8B`) neutrinos. These neutrinos have a continuous and broad energy spectrum, extending up to about 15 MeV. They contribute to the flux in *both* band 1 and band 2. In our scenario, this source is **turned off**.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** The CNO cycle also produces neutrinos (`13N`, `15O`) with continuous spectra that overlap with our bands. The CNO cycle is a minor contributor to the Sun's energy compared to the pp-chain but is stated to be unaffected.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Flux in Each Band *After* the Change:**\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   Before the change, the flux came from `8B` and CNO neutrinos.\n        *   After the change, the `8B` contribution is gone. The only remaining source of neutrinos in this energy range is the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle flux is continuous and relatively low.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   Before the change, the flux came from `8B`, CNO, and the very strong `7Be` line at 862 keV.\n        *   After the change, the `8B` contribution is gone. The remaining sources are the CNO cycle and, crucially, the **`7Be` line at 862 keV**.\n        *   The `7Be` reaction is part of the pp-II chain and is unaffected. It produces a monoenergetic line, meaning all of its considerable flux is concentrated at a single energy, which falls within this band. The flux from this single line is orders of magnitude greater than the flux from the continuous CNO spectrum in the same band. Therefore, the flux in band 2 is completely dominated by the `7Be` neutrinos.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Approximate Ratio:**\n\n    *   Flux (band 1) ≈ Flux from CNO cycle neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range.\n    *   Flux (band 2) ≈ Flux from `7Be` neutrinos (at 862 keV).\n\n    We need to compare the magnitudes:\n    *   The total flux of `7Be` neutrinos is very large, approximately 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second.\n    *   The total flux from the main CNO neutrinos (`13N` and `15O`) is roughly an order of magnitude smaller, about 5 x 10⁸ per cm² per second. This total flux is spread out over an energy range of more than 1 MeV. The portion of this flux that falls within the 100 keV window of band 1 is only a fraction of this total.\n    *   A rough estimate for the CNO flux in the 100 keV window of band 1 would be around 5 x 10⁷ per cm² per second.\n\n    Now, let's form the ratio:\n\n    Ratio = Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2)\n    Ratio ≈ (Flux from CNO in a 100 keV window) / (Total flux from `7Be` line)\n    Ratio ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹)\n    Ratio ≈ 10⁻² or 0.01\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The flux in the 800-900 keV band, dominated by the unaffected `7Be` line, is approximately 100 times larger than the flux in the 700-800 keV band, which is only sourced by the relatively weak CNO cycle after the `8B` neutrinos have vanished. Therefore, the ratio of Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2) is approximately 0.01.\n\n<<<C>>>"
