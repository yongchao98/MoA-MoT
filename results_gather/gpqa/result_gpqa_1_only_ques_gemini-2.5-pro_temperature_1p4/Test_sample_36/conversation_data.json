    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product E and determine the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A**\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) and ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) with a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a thioacetal. The aldehyde's carbonyl group reacts with the two thiol groups of EDT to form a 1,3-dithiolane, which serves as a protecting group for the aldehyde.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi ---> B**\n*   **Reactants:** Product A and Butyllithium (BuLi), a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi deprotonates the acidic proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring). This forms a nucleophilic carbanion, an example of \"umpolung\" (polarity reversal).\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane ---> C**\n*   **Reactants:** The carbanion B and bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br).\n*   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic carbanion B attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding an ethyl group at the C2 position.\n*   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ ---> D**\n*   **Reactants:** Product C and reagents for thioacetal deprotection (HgCl₂, H₂O, H⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** The thioacetal protecting group is removed, and the original carbonyl group is regenerated. The carbon atom that was C2 of the dithiolane ring is now a carbonyl carbon with two ethyl groups attached.\n*   **Product D:** 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone).\n\n     \n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E**\n*   **Reactants:** Product D (3-pentanone) and the reagents for a Wittig reaction.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  First, the Wittig reagent (ylide) is formed in situ. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) to form a phosphonium salt.\n    2.  BuLi deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus atom to form the phosphorus ylide: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    3.  This ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The C=O double bond is replaced with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product E:** The carbonyl carbon of 3-pentanone, which has two ethyl groups, forms a double bond with the ylide carbon, which also has two ethyl groups. The final product is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n     \n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Final Product E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene)**\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n           CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has multiple C₂ symmetry axes. As a result of this symmetry, many carbon atoms are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The two carbons forming the central double bond (C=C) are in identical environments and are therefore equivalent.\n    *   All four ethyl groups attached to the double bond are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We can group the ten carbon atoms into three sets of chemically equivalent carbons:\n    1.  **Signal 1:** The two sp²-hybridized carbons of the central C=C double bond.\n    2.  **Signal 2:** The four -CH₂- carbons of the ethyl groups. They are all equivalent.\n    3.  **Signal 3:** The four -CH₃ carbons at the ends of the ethyl groups. They are all equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the 13C-NMR spectrum of the final product E will show a total of **3 signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
