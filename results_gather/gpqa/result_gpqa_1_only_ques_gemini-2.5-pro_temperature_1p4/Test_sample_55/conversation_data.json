    "The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via a two-step electric dipole transition. We need to identify a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n**1. Identify the Decay Path**\n\nThe decay proceeds in two steps, with an intermediate state $|k\\rangle$:\n$|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe transitions are governed by the electric dipole selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n**Step 1: First Transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$**\n\n*   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l_k - l = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow l_k - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_k = 1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m_k - m = 0, \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m_k - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m_k$ are $0, 1, -1$.\n*   For spontaneous emission, the energy must decrease, so $n_k < n$. Thus $n_k$ can be 2 or 1. However, for $n_k=1$, only $l_k=0$ is possible, which violates $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n_k=2$.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. All options suggest the intermediate state is in the $n=2$ shell, which is consistent.\n\n**Step 2: Second Transition $|n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   Let's check if the transition from the identified intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   Intermediate states: $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$ with $m_k \\in \\{0,1,-1\\}$.\n*   Final state: $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l_f - l_k = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m_f - m_k = 0 - m_k = -m_k$. For $m_k \\in \\{0,1,-1\\}$, $-m_k$ will be in $\\{0,-1,1\\}$, which satisfies the selection rule.\n\nSo, all three possible paths through the intermediate states $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are valid decay routes. All routes presented in the options A, C, D are physically possible. Option B is a typo but refers to the same path as A.\n\n**2. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that cascade path. The probability of a cascade through a specific intermediate state $|k\\rangle$ is:\n$P(\\text{path } k) = BR(|i\\rangle \\to |k\\rangle) \\times BR(|k\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle)$\n\n*   **Branching Ratio of the second step, $BR(|k\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle)$:**\n    The intermediate state is $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ (a $2p$ state). For a dipole transition, the final state must have $l=0$ or $l=2$. The only state with lower energy is the $n=1$ state, which only has $l=0$ ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). There are no other allowed decay channels for the $2p$ state. Therefore, it decays to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with 100% probability.\n    $BR(|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n*   **Branching Ratio of the first step, $BR(|i\\rangle \\to |k\\rangle)$:**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ can only decay via dipole transition to $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states (as argued before, $n=1$ is not a possible final shell for a state with $l=1$). We need to find the relative probabilities for decaying into the three substates $|2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    The transition rate $\\Gamma$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n    $\\Gamma_{i \\to k} \\propto |\\langle k | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\n\n    For the transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$, we need to evaluate the matrix elements for $m_k = 0, \\pm 1$. By the Wigner-Eckart theorem, for a transition from an initial state with $l=0, m=0$, the transition rates to the different final $m_k$ states of a given $l_k$ are equal. This is because the initial state is spherically symmetric, and in the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission.\n\n    Let's confirm this: The rate to a specific state $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ is proportional to $\\sum_{q} |\\langle 2,1,m_k | r_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$, where $r_q$ are the spherical components of the position operator. The selection rule $m_k = m + q$ with $m=0$ gives $m_k=q$. Thus only one term contributes to the sum for each $m_k$. The rate is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,m_k | r_{m_k} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    The Wigner-Eckart theorem gives:\n    $\\langle 2,1,m_k | r_{m_k} | 3,0,0 \\rangle = \\langle 1,m_k; 1,m_k | 0,0 \\rangle \\langle 2,1 ||r|| 3,0 \\rangle$\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1,m_k; 1,m_k | 0,0 \\rangle$ is related to $\\langle 0,0; 1,m_k | 1,m_k \\rangle$ which equals 1 for all $m_k$. The reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1 ||r|| 3,0 \\rangle$ is independent of any magnetic quantum numbers.\n    Therefore, the magnitudes of the matrix elements are equal for $m_k = 0, 1, -1$. Since the energy difference $E_3-E_2$ is also the same for all three transitions, the transition rates are equal:\n    $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle\\to|2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle\\to|2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle\\to|2,1,-1\\rangle)$\n\n    Since there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, the branching ratio for any one of them is $1/3$.\n    $BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_k\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The probability for the specific path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,m_k\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is:\n    $P(\\text{path } m_k) = BR(\\text{step 1}) \\times BR(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe probability for any of the three possible cascade routes is $1/3$. Now we check the options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is correct.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be $1/3$).\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be $1/3$).\n\nOnly option A provides a correct combination of a valid path and its calculated probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
