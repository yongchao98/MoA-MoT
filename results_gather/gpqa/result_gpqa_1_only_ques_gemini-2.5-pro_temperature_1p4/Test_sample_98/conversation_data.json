    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadening is a key characteristic.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears between 1700 and 1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the options.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates that there are no C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **d** (doublet): one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **t** (triplet): two neighboring protons (2H).\n    *   **q** (quartet): three neighboring protons (3H).\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **d** (doublet): one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **t** (triplet): two neighboring protons (2H).\n    *   **t** (triplet): another set of two neighboring protons (2H).\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to find the structure that contains protons with these exact neighboring environments.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Proposed Structure\n\nLet's examine the protons on the main carbon chain for each option, as these are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      CH₃(g)  CH₃(h)\n      |       |\n(f)H₃(e)H₂C - C(Hb) - C(Ha) - COOH\n```\n*   **Ha (proton on C2):** It is coupled to Hb (1H) giving a doublet, and the methyl group (h) (3H) giving a quartet. **Signal: doublet of quartets (dq).**\n*   **Hb (proton on C3):** It is coupled to Ha (1H, doublet), its own methyl group (g) (3H, quartet), and the adjacent methylene group (e) (2H, triplet). **Signal: doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which is equivalent to a **dtq**.\n*   **Conclusion for D:** This structure has a **dtq** signal (from Hb), but it does not have any proton that would produce a **dtt** signal. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      (d)CH₃\n      |\n(e)H₃C - C(Hb) - C(Ha)(CH₃f) - CH₂(c) - COOH\n```\n*   **Ha (proton on C3):** It is coupled to Hb (1H, doublet), its methyl group (f) (3H, quartet), and the methylene group (c) (2H, triplet). **Signal: doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which is a **dtq**.\n*   **Hb (proton on C4):** It is coupled to Ha (1H, doublet) and the two methyl groups (d, e) on its carbon (a total of 6H). This gives a septet. **Signal: doublet of septets (d-sept).**\n*   **Conclusion for C:** This structure has a **dtq** signal, but the other complex signal is a d-sept, not a dtt. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      C₂H₅(g)  C₂H₅(h)\n      |        |\n(f)H₃(e)H₂C - C(Hb) - C(Ha) - COOH\n```\nLet's break down the ethyl groups (C₂H₅ = -CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Hb (proton on C4):** This proton is coupled to Ha (1H, doublet), the CH₂ of the terminal ethyl group (e) (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group substituent (g) (2H, triplet). **Signal: doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Ha (proton on C3):** This proton is coupled to Hb (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group substituent (h) (2H, triplet). This would normally give a doublet of triplets (dt). However, 4-bond (long-range) coupling can sometimes be observed. If Ha also couples to the terminal CH₃ of its ethyl group (h) (3H), the signal would become a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This is a plausible explanation for the second observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This structure definitively contains a proton (Hb) that gives a **dtt** signal. It also contains a proton (Ha) that could plausibly give the **dtq** signal if a 4-bond coupling is observed. Compared to the other options which definitively lack one of the signals, this is the most viable candidate.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis formula is ambiguous, but it corresponds to a C₉H₁₈O₂ isomer like structure A. While an isomer of C₉H₁₈O₂ exists that perfectly fits both NMR signals (3-methyl-4-ethylhexanoic acid), it does not match the written condensed formula of any of the options. Given the choices, we must evaluate the structures as presented.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n*   Structure A definitively exhibits a **dtt** signal from standard couplings and can plausibly exhibit a **dtq** signal through a common long-range coupling effect.\n*   Structures C and D exhibit a **dtq** signal but definitively cannot exhibit a **dtt** signal.\n*   Structure A is the only one that can account for both observed complex multiplets.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH.\n\n<<<A>>>"
