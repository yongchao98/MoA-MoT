    "This problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\n\nThe electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'`, placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`:\n\n*   The **image charge `q'`** is located on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. Its magnitude is:\n    `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n*   The **position of the image charge `b`** from the center is:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of `q` and the grounded sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: `q` at distance `d` from the origin, and `q'` at distance `b` from the origin. The potential energy is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done `W` by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity (`x = ∞`) to the position `d`.\n\n`U = W = ∫_∞^d F_ext • dx`\n\nThe external force `F_ext` is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force `F_elec` exerted on the charge `q` by the induced charges on the sphere. Using the method of images, this force is the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\n`F_ext = -F_elec`\n\nWhen the charge `q` is at a variable position `x` from the center, the image charge `q'(x)` and its position `b(x)` are:\n`q'(x) = -q * (R/x)`\n`b(x) = R^2 / x`\n\nThe electrostatic force on `q` at position `x` is the force from its image:\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance between them)²`\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)²`\n`F_elec(x) = - (k * q^2 * R) / x * 1 / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)²`\n`F_elec(x) = - (k * q^2 * R) / x * x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)²`\n`F_elec(x) = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)²`\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done:\n`U = W = - ∫_∞^d F_elec(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫_∞^d [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)²] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^d x / (x^2 - R^2)² dx`\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the substitution:\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`.\nThen `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du / 2`.\n\nThe limits of integration also change:\nWhen `x = ∞`, `u = ∞² - R² = ∞`.\nWhen `x = d`, `u = d² - R²`.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^(d²-R²) (1/u²) * (du/2)`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^(d²-R²) u⁻² du`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-u⁻¹]_∞^(d²-R²)`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u]_∞^(d²-R²)`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (d² - R²)) - (-1 / ∞)]`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (d² - R²)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative Method (Quicker)**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\nUsing the image method, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the position of the real charge `q`.\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\nDistance = `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n`q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n`V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, calculate the energy `U`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [- (k * q * R) / (d² - R²)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
