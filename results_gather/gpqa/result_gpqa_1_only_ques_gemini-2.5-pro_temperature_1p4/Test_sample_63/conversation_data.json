    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Mixture Composition**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the data from each tube to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂, etc. Since the weight did not change, there were no acidic gases in the mixture. This implies the original salts A and B did not contain carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or decomposable sulfite/sulfate anions.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning a gas containing oxygen reacted with the copper. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from a gas like O₂, NO, or N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas (at standard temperature and pressure, STP) remains.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents used, suggesting it is likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the gaseous products must have come from the original salt mixture. The total mass of the mixture was 7.20 g.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O reacted with Cu)\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as no other elements are indicated.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass of H - Mass of O\n    *   Mass of N = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe presence of N, H, and O suggests the salts are likely ammonium salts with nitrogen-oxygen anions (e.g., nitrate, nitrite).\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the salts are common ammonium compounds whose decomposition products match our findings.\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) decomposition: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) decomposition (at ~200°C): NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThis decomposition pattern produces a mixture of N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. Let's see if it fits the data.\n*   N₂ is an inert gas (Gas C).\n*   N₂O is a non-acidic gas that reacts with hot copper: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   H₂O is absorbed by the desiccant.\n\nLet's assume the mixture is equimolar, containing `n` moles of salt A (NH₄NO₃) and `n` moles of salt B (NH₄NO₂).\n\nFrom the decomposition reactions:\n*   Moles of N₂O produced = `n` (from NH₄NO₃)\n*   Moles of N₂ produced initially = `n` (from NH₄NO₂)\n*   Moles of H₂O produced = 2`n` (from NH₄NO₃) + 2`n` (from NH₄NO₂) = 4`n`\n\nWe know from our analysis that 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n*   4`n` = 0.20 mol  =>  `n` = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the original mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂. Let's check if this is consistent with all the other data.\n\n*   **Gas reacting with Cu:** The gas is N₂O. Moles of N₂O = `n` = 0.05 mol. This contains 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 0.80 g. This matches the mass increase of tube №3. **(Consistent)**\n\n*   **Remaining Gas:** The initial gas mixture contained `n` = 0.05 mol of N₂. The reaction in tube №3 (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂) produced another `n` = 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   Total moles of final gas = 0.05 mol (initial) + 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.10 mol. This matches the moles of Gas C. **(Consistent)**\n\n*   **Initial Mass:** Let's calculate the mass of the initial mixture.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n    *   Total mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass. **(Consistent)**\n\nThe identification of the salts as ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) is correct.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
