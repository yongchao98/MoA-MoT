    "This problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. The Hamiltonian and Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the system is:\n$H = \\frac{p_x^2}{2m} + \\frac{p_y^2}{2m} + \\frac{p_z^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2(x^2+y^2+z^2)$\n\nThis Hamiltonian is separable into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\nwhere $H_i = \\frac{p_i^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2i^2$ for $i=x, y, z$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalue of a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n\nThe total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three 1D oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n**2. Identifying the Energy States**\n\n*   **Ground State (lowest energy state):**\n    $N=0 \\implies n_x=n_y=n_z=0$.\n    Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **First Excited State:**\n    $N=1 \\implies n_x+n_y+n_z=1$.\n    Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Second Excited State:**\n    $N=2 \\implies n_x+n_y+n_z=2$.\n    Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Third Excited State:**\n    $N=3 \\implies n_x+n_y+n_z=3$.\n    Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Degeneracy**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same value of $N$. We need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n\nLet's list the possible combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ for $N=3$:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)  -> 3 states\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n    (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2)  -> 6 states\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    (1, 1, 1)  -> 1 state\n\nTotal number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the degeneracy $g_N$ of the N-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, $N=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
