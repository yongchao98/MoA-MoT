    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ and determine the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n**1. Mass Dimensions in Natural Units**\n\nIn quantum field theory, we often use natural units where the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1. In this system, mass, energy, and momentum all have the dimension of mass, $[M]$, while length and time have the dimension of inverse mass, $[M]^{-1}$.\n\nThe action $S$ is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe action must be a dimensionless quantity. The spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has dimensions of (length)$^4$, so its mass dimension is $[d^4x] = [L^4] = [M^{-4}]$. For the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[\\mathcal{L}] = [M^4]$.\n\n**2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nWe can determine the mass dimensions of the fields by looking at their standard kinetic terms in the full Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion Field $\\psi$:** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{Dirac} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. The entire term must have a dimension of $[M^4]$. Let's analyze the mass term, $m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$.\n    *   The mass parameter $m$ has a dimension of mass: $[m] = [M^1]$.\n    *   The term $m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$ must have the dimension of the Lagrangian, $[M^4]$.\n    *   Therefore, $[m][\\bar{\\psi}\\psi] = [M^1][\\bar{\\psi}\\psi] = [M^4]$, which gives $[\\bar{\\psi}\\psi] = [M^3]$.\n    *   Since $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$ have the same mass dimension, we have $[\\psi]^2 = [M^3]$, which means $[\\psi] = [M]^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Field Strength Tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$:** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{Maxwell} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   This term must have a dimension of $[M^4]$, so $[(F^{\\mu\\nu})^2] = [M^4]$.\n    *   This implies that the field strength tensor itself has a mass dimension of $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M^2]$.\n\n*   **Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$:** The term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$. The gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless: $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = [M^0]$.\n\n**3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction term: $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\nLike any term in the Lagrangian density, this term must have a mass dimension of $[M^4]$.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M^4]$.\n\nLet's substitute the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa] [M^{3/2}] [M^0] [M^{3/2}] [M^2] = [M^4]$\n$[\\kappa] [M^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2}] = [M^4]$\n$[\\kappa] [M^{3 + 2}] = [M^4]$\n$[\\kappa] [M^5] = [M^4]$\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of $\\kappa$:\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{[M^4]}{[M^5]} = [M^{-1}]$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability.\n\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension ($[g] > 0$), the interaction is super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension ($[g] = 0$), the interaction is renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension ($[g] < 0$), the interaction is non-renormalizable.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that as we calculate higher-order loop corrections in perturbation theory, the degree of divergence increases. To cancel these new, more severe divergences, we would need to introduce an infinite number of new counter-terms into the Lagrangian, which makes the theory lose its predictive power. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of the coupling constant is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
