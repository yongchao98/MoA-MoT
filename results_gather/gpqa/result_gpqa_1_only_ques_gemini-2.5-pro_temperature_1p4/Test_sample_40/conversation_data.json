    "This problem is solved using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's define the frames of reference:\n\n1.  **Frame S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the rest frame of the observer.\n2.  **Frame S' (Glass's Rest Frame):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass.\n\nNow let's identify the velocities involved:\n\n*   The speed of light in the glass, as measured within the glass's own rest frame (S'), is given by `u' = c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed is `u' = 1/n`.\n*   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is `v`. The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n*   We want to find the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). Let's call this speed `u`.\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula is:\n\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v/c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the values we have into this formula, remembering that `c=1`:\n\n1.  `u' = 1/n`\n2.  `v = v`\n3.  `c = 1`\n\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n\nLet's simplify this expression:\n\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo get rid of the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n\n`u = (n * (1/n + v)) / (n * (1 + v/n))`\n\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nB) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nC) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nD) 1\n\nOur calculated speed `u = (1+n*v)/(n+v)` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
