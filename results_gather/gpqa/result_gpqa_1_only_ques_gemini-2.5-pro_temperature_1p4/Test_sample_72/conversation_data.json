    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nWe need to find the speed of one astronaut relative to the other. Since they are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative velocity. Let the lab frame be S, and the frame of the second astronaut be S'. The velocities of the two astronauts in the lab frame (S) are $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$ or $v_{12}$) of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2 is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is $v_{rel} = 0.14c$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its components. The total energy (E) of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and speed $v$ is given by:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   Rest mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Speed: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   Rest mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Speed: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is $E = 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately $0.14c$ and the total energy is approximately $5.96 mc^2$. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
