    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Define Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of the target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n\n2.  **Analyze λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   λ1 is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   In this case, both the projectile and the target are moving gas molecules. To account for the relative motion of the molecules, a factor of √2 is introduced into the formula.\n    *   The formula for λ1 is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` = collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   λ2 is the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding with gas molecules.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they are traveling at relativistic speeds, close to the speed of light. This velocity is vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered as stationary targets. The √2 factor, which accounts for target motion, is not used here.\n    *   The formula for λ2 is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (this is the same as in the λ1 calculation because the temperature and pressure of the gas have not changed).\n        *   `σ_eg` = collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   The collision cross-section represents the effective \"target area\" a particle presents for a collision.\n    *   **σ_gg (Molecule-Molecule):** A collision occurs if the center of one molecule (diameter `d`) comes within a distance `d` of the center of another molecule. The effective target area is thus a circle of radius `d`, so **σ_gg = πd²**.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Molecule):** A collision occurs if the electron (which is essentially a point particle compared to the molecule) comes within a distance of the molecule's radius (`r = d/2`) from the molecule's center. The effective target area is a circle of radius `r`, so **σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = πd²/4**.\n    *   From this simple hard-sphere model, we see that **σ_gg ≈ 4 * σ_eg**. The molecule-molecule collision cross-section is significantly larger than the electron-molecule collision cross-section because a molecule is a much larger projectile than an electron.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of λ2 to λ1:**\n    *   Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1 using the formulas from steps 2 and 3.\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n    *   Now, substitute the relationship between the cross-sections from step 4:\n    *   λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2 * (4) = 4√2 ≈ 5.66\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculation shows that λ2 is approximately 5.66 times larger than λ1. This means the electrons travel, on average, a much longer distance between collisions with gas molecules than the gas molecules travel between collisions with each other.\n    *   We can definitively conclude that **λ2 > λ1**.\n    *   Now let's examine the options:\n        *   A) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. Our calculated result (λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1) satisfies this inequality.\n        *   B) λ2 = λ1. This is incorrect.\n        *   C) λ2 < λ1. This is incorrect.\n        *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1. This is incorrect, as our result shows λ2 is significantly larger than 1.22 * λ1.\n\nThe most accurate conclusion based on the principles of collision physics is that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Option A is the only choice that correctly reflects this physical reality. The number 1.22 is likely included as a distractor, possibly referencing the Rayleigh criterion in optics, which is not relevant here.\n\n<<<A>>>"
