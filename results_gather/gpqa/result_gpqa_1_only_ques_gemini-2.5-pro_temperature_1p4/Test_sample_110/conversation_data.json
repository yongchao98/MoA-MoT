    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. We have a ketone with an α-hydrogen (enolate precursor), a strong bulky base (t-BuOK), and an α,β-unsaturated ester (Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate an α-carbon of the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has **no α-hydrogens**.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group) and has **one α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from C6, leading to the formation of a single, specific enolate.\n\n    ```\n          O                     O(-)\n         //                    //\n        /  \\                   /  \\\n       |    |--Me    + t-BuO-  <=>  C----C(Me)  + t-BuOH\n    Et-|----|                      |    |\n    Me-|----/                  Et--|----|\n                               Me--|----/\n    Ketone                  (Enolate at C6)\n    ```\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The C6 carbon of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n\n    ```\n    (Enolate at C6) + CH₂=CH-COOEt   --->   Intermediate\n    ```\n    A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Protonation:** The resulting intermediate is protonated (e.g., during an aqueous workup or by the t-BuOH formed in the first step) to give the final product, **A**.\n\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n        /  \\\n       |    |--Me\n    Et-|----|   |\n    Me-|----/   CH₂-CH₂-COOEt\n    ```\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:** To name the product, we follow IUPAC nomenclature. The question names it as a substituted propanoate.\n    *   Parent chain: `ethyl ... propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone). This carbon becomes C1'.\n    *   Numbering the ring to give the lowest possible locants for all substituents:\n        *   C1' is the attachment point and has a methyl group.\n        *   C2' has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3' has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   This gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. We have a nitroalkane with acidic α-protons, a strong base (KOH), and an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:** The base, hydroxide (OH⁻ from KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion, which is the nucleophile.\n\n    ```\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂  +  OH⁻   <=>   CH₃-CH₂-CH(-)-NO₂  +  H₂O\n                                (Nucleophilic carbanion)\n    ```\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-C**H**=CH-CN).\n\n    ```\n            (Nucleophile)            (Michael acceptor)\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH(-)-NO₂   +   CH₃-CH=CH-CN   --->   Intermediate\n    ```\n    A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation:** The intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product, **B**.\n\n    ```\n            NO₂\n            |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH — CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    ```\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:** To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has 6 carbons. The parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile carbon:\n        `C(6)H₃-C(5)H₂-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(2)H₂-C(1)N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Listing them alphabetically, the full name of product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
