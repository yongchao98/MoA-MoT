    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of its molecular symmetry.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. Toluene has a methyl group (-CH3) on a benzene ring. The methyl group is an ortho-, para-director and an activating group.\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is the standard nitrating agent.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction produces a mixture of *ortho*-nitrotoluene and *para*-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product. In multi-step synthesis problems, we typically follow the major product pathway.\n*   **Product 1 is *p*-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4.**\n*   **Reactant:** *p*-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is an oxidizing medium.\n*   **Reaction:** The benzylic methyl group (-CH3) of *p*-nitrotoluene can be oxidized. This oxidation can lead to either an aldehyde (-CHO) or a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   Path A: Oxidation to a carboxylic acid gives *p*-nitrobenzoic acid.\n    *   Path B: Oxidation to an aldehyde gives *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n*   To determine which product is intended, we must consider the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n*   **Reagents:** Acetone ((CH3)2C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of a base-catalyzed aldol-type condensation. Acetone, in the presence of a strong base like NaOH, forms an enolate ion (⁻CH2C(O)CH3), which is a strong nucleophile. This enolate attacks a carbonyl group.\n*   This implies that Product 2 must have a carbonyl group, specifically an aldehyde, to participate in this reaction (known as a Claisen-Schmidt condensation). If Product 2 were *p*-nitrobenzoic acid (from Path A), the reaction with acetone enolate would form a Meisenheimer complex, which is an anionic intermediate rather than a stable final product, and its symmetry (C1) is not among the options.\n*   Therefore, we must conclude that **Product 2 is *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde**. The question intends for the oxidation in Step 2 to yield the aldehyde.\n*   **The Reaction in Step 3:** *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense) reacts with the enolate of acetone. The resulting aldol adduct readily dehydrates under the reaction conditions to yield an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CHO + CH₃COCH₃ --(NaOH)--> p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃ + H₂O\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is 4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one. Due to steric reasons, the more stable *E* (trans) isomer is formed preferentially.\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\n*   **Structure:** The structure of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one is:\n    ```\n          NO₂\n          |\n       /¯¯¯\\\n      |     |--CH=CH--C(=O)--CH₃\n       \\___/\n    ```\n*   **Conformation:** The molecule has an extended π-conjugated system (p-nitrophenyl group, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). This conjugation favors a planar arrangement of the heavy atoms (excluding the hydrogens of the methyl group).\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Let's analyze this planar conformation for symmetry elements.\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    2.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The plane that contains the benzene ring, the nitro group, the C=C bond, and the C=O group is a plane of symmetry. For this to be true, the methyl (-CH₃) group must be oriented such that it respects this plane (e.g., one C-H bond lies in the plane, and the other two are symmetrically above and below it). This is a standard consideration for molecules with freely rotating groups.\n    3.  **Axis of Rotation (Cn):** There are no Cn axes of rotation (for n > 1). Rotating the molecule 180° around any axis does not result in an identical structure.\n    4.  **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion. The two ends of the molecule are different (a nitrophenyl group on one side, an acetyl group on the other).\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nSince our analysis leads to the Cs point group, and this is one of the options, we can be confident in our answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
