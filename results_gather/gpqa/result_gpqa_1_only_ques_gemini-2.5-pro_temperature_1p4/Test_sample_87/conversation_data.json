    "The scenario describes an immune response to an orally delivered antigen (GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins) in a secondary lymphoid organ associated with the gut (Peyer's patches). Here's a breakdown of the key information and how it points to the correct process:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery and Localization:** The antigen reaches the Peyer's patches, which are key sites for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n2.  **Cellular Response:** A cell population in the Peyer's patches is found to be proliferating. This indicates an active immune response, where lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) that recognize the antigen are activated and begin to divide.\n3.  **Genetic Analysis:** Sequencing the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating cells reveals \"high variability.\" This is the crucial piece of information.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this:\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors *before* a B cell ever encounters an antigen. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during B cell development. The scenario describes a response to a specific antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ, so VDJ recombination has already occurred in these cells long before this experiment.\n*   **B) complement activation:** This is part of the innate immune system and involves a cascade of proteins that help eliminate pathogens. It does not involve changing the genetic sequence of B cell variable regions.\n*   **C) somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) *after* they encounter an antigen. SHM introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (including the heavy chain). The purpose of this is to generate B cells with higher-affinity antibodies, a process called affinity maturation. The \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene is the direct result of somatic hypermutation.\n*   **D) class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, which switches the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG). It does *not* affect the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding and is the source of the observed variability in this scenario.\n\nThe key observation is high variability in the **variable** region of the heavy chain gene in a proliferating B cell population after antigen exposure. This is the definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
