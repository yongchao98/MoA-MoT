    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the carbonyl region (C=O). Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The presence of these signals confirms the existence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong evidence for the -COOH functional group.\n\n4.  **Putting It All Together and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The combined spectroscopic data indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and C (C₆H₁₀O).\n    *   We are left with A (C₆H₁₂O₂) and D (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n    *   To choose between these two, we use the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), which tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n        *   The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   Our compound must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond of the alkene.\n    *   Let's calculate the DBE for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula can only account for the C=O bond of the acid, meaning it represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid. This contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DBE of 2 perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>"
