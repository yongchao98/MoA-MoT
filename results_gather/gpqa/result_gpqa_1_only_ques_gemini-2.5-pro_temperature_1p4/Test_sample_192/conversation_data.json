    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\". This is astronomical phrasing for the number density of stars with respect to parallax. Let `N` be the number of stars, `plx` be the parallax, and `r` be the distance. The given information can be written as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n    Here, `dN/d(plx)` represents the number of stars per unit interval of parallax.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically \"per unit range of distance, r\". This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Find the Relationship between the Variables:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related. The standard formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    (assuming `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule to Change Variables:**\n    To convert the derivative from being with respect to `plx` to being with respect to `r`, we use the chain rule of calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    Since we are interested in how the number of stars *changes* (i.e., the magnitude of the density), we can consider the absolute value: `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n    We know `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`. We also need to express `plx` in terms of `r` using `plx = 1/r`.\n    So, `1/plx⁵ = 1/(1/r)⁵ = r⁵`.\n    Therefore, `dN/d(plx) ∝ r⁵`.\n\n    Now substitute this and the derivative `d(plx)/dr` back into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n    (We use the magnitude of the derivative as number density is a positive quantity).\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, varies as `r³`. Comparing this to the options:\n    A) ~ r³\n    B) ~ r⁵\n    C) ~ r⁴\n    D) ~ r²\n\n    The correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
