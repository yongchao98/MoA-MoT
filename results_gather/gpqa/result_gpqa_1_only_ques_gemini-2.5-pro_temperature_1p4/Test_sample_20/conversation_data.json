    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (tautomers) that readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups. The carbons alpha (adjacent) to these ketone groups are CH₂ groups, so there are alpha-hydrogens available. This allows for keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, this compound extensively tautomerizes to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), because the resulting enol is an aromatic and therefore very stable compound. Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** This compound has a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other. The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the ketone groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring. These carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, keto-enol tautomerism cannot occur. Thus, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (carbon-2):\n    1.  It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n    2.  It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    3.  It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    4.  It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Molecules with a center of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n*   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   (B) The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the options provided:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
