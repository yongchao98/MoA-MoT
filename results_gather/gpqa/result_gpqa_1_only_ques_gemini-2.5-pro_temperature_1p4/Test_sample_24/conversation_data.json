    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to identify the correct reactants A and B.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + H₂SO₄ ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** This is an acid-catalyzed (H₂SO₄) reaction that transforms a reactant A into a spiroketone. The transformation of a fused ring system into a spiro ring system via acid catalysis is characteristic of a **Pinacol rearrangement**. The pinacol rearrangement involves the 1,2-shift of an alkyl group in a 1,2-diol (a vicinal diol) to form a ketone or aldehyde.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reactant Type:** The starting material (A) must be a 1,2-diol that can rearrange to form the spiro[4.5]decane skeleton. The product is a spiro[4.5]decane (a 5-membered ring and a 6-membered ring sharing a carbon). The reactant is likely a decalin (bicyclo[4.4.0]decane) derivative, specifically a decalin-diol.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options for A:**\n    *   Options A and D suggest A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol. Treating this alcohol with H₂SO₄ would cause dehydration to an alkene, not a rearrangement to a ketone. This is incorrect.\n    *   Options B and C suggest A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol. \"Octahydronaphthalene\" is another name for decalin. The \"-4a,8a-diol\" indicates that the two hydroxyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons, making it a vicinal diol. This is the classic substrate for the pinacol rearrangement that leads to a spiro[4.5]decan-6-one system. The methyl groups at positions 2 and 7 are carried through the reaction to become the methyl groups at positions 2 and 8 in the spiroketone product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Reactant A is **2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol**. This eliminates options A and D. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BuLi + H⁺ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** This reaction involves a strong base (BuLi, n-butyllithium) followed by an acid workup (H⁺) to produce a homoallylic alcohol (the -OH and C=C are separated by two carbons). This pattern is characteristic of the **[2,3]-Wittig rearrangement**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reactant Type:** The [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement is a transformation of an allylic ether. The strong base deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the ether oxygen, and the resulting carbanion rearranges.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options for B:**\n    *   **Option B's Reactant B:** 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one. This is a ketone. Reacting a ketone with BuLi, a strong nucleophile and source of the butyl anion (Bu⁻), would result in the addition of a butyl group to the carbonyl carbon. The product would be a tertiary alcohol containing a butyl group, which is not the product shown. Simple reduction of the ketone is not the primary function of BuLi. Therefore, this option is chemically inconsistent.\n    *   **Option C's Reactant B:** (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let's analyze this name:\n        *   \"methyl)benzene\" refers to a benzyl group (Ph-CH₂-).\n        *   \"(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)\" refers to a prenyloxy group ((CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-O-).\n        *   Putting them together gives benzyl prenyl ether: **Ph-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**.\n        This molecule is an allylic ether and has acidic benzylic protons (on the Ph-CH₂- group) that can be readily removed by BuLi. This makes it a perfect substrate for a [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement.\n\n4.  **Mechanism Check:**\n    *   Deprotonation of benzyl prenyl ether with BuLi gives the anion Ph-CH⁻-O-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.\n    *   This anion undergoes a concerted [2,3]-sigmatropic shift to form the alkoxide Ph-CH(O⁻)-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂.\n    *   Protonation with H⁺ gives the alcohol Ph-CH(OH)-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂ (2,2-dimethyl-1-phenylbut-3-en-1-ol).\n    *   **Note:** The product stated in the question (4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol) is an isomer of the actual product of this reaction. This is a common type of error in exam questions. However, the combination of reactants and reagents in option C is the only one that represents a valid and well-known named reaction pathway consistent with the reaction type. The chemical transformation proposed in option B is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion for B:** Reactant B is the benzyl prenyl ether, **(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene**.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nCombining the conclusions for both reactions:\n*   Reactant A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol\n*   Reactant B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
