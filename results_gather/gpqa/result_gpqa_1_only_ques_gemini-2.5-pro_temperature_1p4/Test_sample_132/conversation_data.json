    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    *   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely in water to form K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates completely in water to form 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H₂O.\n    *   The main phosphate species present are H₂PO₄⁻ (a weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (its conjugate base). This pair forms a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of the phosphate species:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005618 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the phosphate species:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n    *   Initial concentration of H₂PO₄⁻: [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻: [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The pH of the buffer is determined by the equilibrium involving H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄).\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ (aq) ⇌ H⁺ (aq) + HPO₄²⁻ (aq)\n    *   The equilibrium constant is Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to solve for [H⁺]. We use the initial concentrations of the acid and base as they are good approximations for the equilibrium concentrations in a buffer.\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ × ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) × (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] = 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), which corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ (aq) ⇌ H⁺ (aq) + PO₄³⁻ (aq)\n    *   The equilibrium constant is Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We rearrange this equation to solve for [PO₄³⁻]. We use the previously calculated [H⁺] and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (since its dissociation is negligible due to the very small Ka₃).\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ × ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) × (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the options:**\n    *   The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n    *   Rounding to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
