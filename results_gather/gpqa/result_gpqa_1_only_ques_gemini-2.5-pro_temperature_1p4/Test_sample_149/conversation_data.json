    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the NMR data.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two neighboring protons (a -CH2- group). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield shifts (normal aromatic protons are >7.0 ppm) indicate the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group. An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** These are the protons of the -CH2- group. They are adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO), and coupling between them would result in the -CH2- protons appearing as a doublet and the -CHO proton as a triplet, which matches the data.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the analysis, the molecule consists of a para-substituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2-CHO) as substituents.\n    The structure of the starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    This is a two-step sequence to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The primary amine (-NH2) reacts with NaNO2 and HCl (at low temperature) to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is then treated with water (and usually gentle warming) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    The product after these two steps is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (or 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n    Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    The product from the previous steps, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde that possesses α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, aldehydes with α-hydrogens undergo an **aldol condensation** reaction. This is a two-part process:\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde (the aldol adduct).\n        The adduct formed is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n    2.  **Dehydration:** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol adduct readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). A proton from the α-carbon and the hydroxyl group from the β-carbon are eliminated, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This creates a conjugated system (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is thermodynamically stable.\n\n*   **Determining the Final Product:**\n    *   Aldol Adduct: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n        (This corresponds to option A, which is an intermediate, not the final product under heat).\n    *   Dehydration Product: The elimination of water from the adduct leads to the formation of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n    *   **Naming the Final Product:** The main carbon chain is a butenal (4 carbons with an aldehyde and a double bond).\n        *   The aldehyde group is at position 1.\n        *   The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 (but-2-enal).\n        *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at position 2.\n        *   There is another (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at position 4.\n        The correct IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition product before dehydration. Not the final product with heat.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure and molecular formula.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches our derived final product from the aldol condensation reaction.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it is missing the hydroxyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
