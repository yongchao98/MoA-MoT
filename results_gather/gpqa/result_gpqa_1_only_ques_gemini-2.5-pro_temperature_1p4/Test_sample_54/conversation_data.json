    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n*   **Signal:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Chemical Shift (δ):** 2.1 ppm is a typical chemical shift for protons of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an acetyl group, CH₃-C=O).\n*   **Integration (3H):** This indicates there are three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group (CH₃).\n*   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the methyl group of an acetate ester (CH₃COO-). All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this is consistent with all options.\n\n**2. Analyze the Vinylic Proton Signals (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):**\n*   Protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons) typically appear in the 4.5-7.5 ppm region. We have two such signals, one at 7.0 ppm and one at 5.5 ppm.\n\n**3. Analyze the Signal at 7.0 ppm:**\n*   **Signal:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n*   **Integration (1H):** One proton.\n*   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to one other proton. This must be the other vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n*   **Coupling Constant (J):** J = 16.0 Hz. This value is crucial. The coupling constant between two vinylic protons depends on their geometry:\n    *   **Trans** coupling: J is typically **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** coupling: J is typically **6-12 Hz**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** configuration across the double bond. This eliminates the *cis* isomers, so options B (Cis-propenyl acetate) and D (Cis-butenyl acetate) are incorrect.\n\n**4. Analyze the Signal at 5.5 ppm:**\n*   **Signal:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n*   **Integration (1H):** One proton.\n*   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets.\n    *   The **doublet** splitting is due to coupling with the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm). The coupling constant should be the same, 16.0 Hz.\n    *   The **quartet** (q) splitting means this proton is coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This indicates an adjacent methyl (CH₃) group.\n\n**5. Analyze the Signal at 1.6 ppm:**\n*   **Signal:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n*   **Chemical Shift (δ):** This region is typical for allylic protons (protons on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond).\n*   **Integration (3H):** Three protons, confirming a methyl group.\n*   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms that this methyl group is adjacent to the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n**6. Assembling the Structure:**\n*   We have an acetate group (CH₃COO-).\n*   We have a *trans* double bond (-CH=CH-).\n*   One end of the double bond is attached to a methyl group (-CH₃). The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-.\n*   The vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm is the one adjacent to this methyl group (explaining its quartet splitting), and the signal at 1.6 ppm is from the methyl group itself (explaining its doublet splitting).\n*   The vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm is attached to the oxygen of the acetate ester. It is highly deshielded (shifted downfield) because of the electronegative oxygen atom. It is only coupled to the other vinylic proton, hence it is a simple doublet.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n      H\n       \\\n   O=C--O--C=C--CH₃\n  /        /\nCH₃      H\n\nThis structure has a propenyl group (-CH=CHCH₃), not a butenyl group (-CH=CHCH₂CH₃). A butenyl group would have resulted in different splitting patterns (e.g., a triplet for the terminal CH₃ and a multiplet for the CH₂).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
