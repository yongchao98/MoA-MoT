    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum.\n\n1.  **Understand the Potential:**\n    The potential energy of the particle is given in two-dimensional polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    $V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 \\cos^2(θ)$\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Coordinate System:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation is easier to solve if the potential is separable. The given potential contains a term with $\\cos^2(θ)$, which suggests that it might simplify in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). Let's perform the coordinate transformation.\n    The relationships between Cartesian and polar coordinates are:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n3.  **Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Substitute the Cartesian expressions into the potential V(r, θ):\n    The first term is $1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)$.\n    The second term is $3/2 kr^2 \\cos^2(θ) = 3/2 k (r \\cos(θ))^2 = 3/2 kx^2$.\n\n    Now, add the terms together to get the potential in Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y):\n    $V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2$\n    Combine the terms with $x^2$:\n    $V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2$\n\n4.  **Recognize the System:**\n    The potential is now in the form $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, where:\n    $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$\n    $V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2$\n    This is the potential for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The motion in the x-direction is independent of the motion in the y-direction.\n\n5.  **Solve the Separable Schrödinger Equation:**\n    Because the potential is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions: $E = E_x + E_y$. We can solve for each part individually using the known solution for the 1D quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential $V(q) = 1/2 k_q q^2$ are given by $E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω$, where the angular frequency is $ω = \\sqrt{k_q/m}$.\n\n    **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$. Comparing this to the standard form $V_x(x) = 1/2 k_x x^2$, we get $k_x = 4k$.\n    The angular frequency for the x-motion is:\n    $ω_x = \\sqrt(k_x/m) = \\sqrt(4k/m) = 2\\sqrt(k/m)$\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ(2\\sqrt(k/m))$\n\n    **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2$. Comparing this to the standard form $V_y(y) = 1/2 k_y y^2$, we get $k_y = k$.\n    The angular frequency for the y-motion is:\n    $ω_y = \\sqrt(k_y/m) = \\sqrt(k/m)$\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ\\sqrt(k/m)$\n\n6.  **Find the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of $E_{n_x}$ and $E_{n_y}$:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ(2\\sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ\\sqrt(k/m)$\n    Let's factor out the common term $ℏ\\sqrt(k/m)$:\n    $E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ℏ\\sqrt(k/m)$\n    $E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] ℏ\\sqrt(k/m)$\n    $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ\\sqrt(k/m)$\n\n    Here, $n_x$ and $n_y$ are the quantum numbers for the x and y oscillators, respectively, and they can be any non-negative integer ($n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ\\sqrt(k/m)$.\n    This matches option B.\n\n    A) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    C) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
