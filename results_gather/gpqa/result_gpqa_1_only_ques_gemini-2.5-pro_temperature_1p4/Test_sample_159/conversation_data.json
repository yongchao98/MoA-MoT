    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Determine the Shape of the Aperture**\n\nThe problem describes an N-sided regular polygon aperture where the number of sides, N, is infinitely large (`N -> ∞`).\n*   The apothem `a` is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n*   The radius `R` is the distance from the center to a vertex.\n*   The relationship between the radius and the apothem in a regular N-sided polygon is given by `a = R * cos(π/N)`.\n*   As `N` approaches infinity (`N -> ∞`), the angle `π/N` approaches 0.\n*   Since `cos(0) = 1`, in the limit as `N -> ∞`, we have `a = R * cos(0)`, which means `a = R`.\n*   An N-sided polygon where `N -> ∞` and the apothem equals the radius is a circle. Therefore, the aperture is a circle of radius `a`.\n\n**2. Identify the Diffraction Pattern**\n\nThe diffraction of a monochromatic light wave by a circular aperture in the far-field region (Fraunhofer diffraction) produces a characteristic pattern known as the Airy pattern. The intensity `I` of this pattern as a function of the angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the central maximum intensity.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n\n**3. Locate the Intensity Minima**\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which corresponds to the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. Let `x = k * a * sinθ`. The minima are found where `J₁(x) = 0`.\n\nThe first few zeros of `J₁(x)` are:\n*   First zero (`x₁`): `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero (`x₂`): `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n**4. Calculate the Angular Positions of the Minima**\n\nThe angular position `θ_m` of the m-th minimum is given by the condition:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n\nThe problem states we can use the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = x_m`\n`θ_m = (x_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   **First Minimum (`θ₁`):**\n    `θ₁ = (x₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n*   **Second Minimum (`θ₂`):**\n    `θ₂ = (x₂ * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n**5. Find the Angular Distance**\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = [1.1166 * (λ / a)] - [0.6098 * (λ / a)]`\n`Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 0.500 λ / a\n*   B) 1.220 λ / a\n*   C) 0.506 λ / a\n*   D) 0.610 λ / a\n\nOur calculated value, `0.5068 * λ / a`, is closest to option C. The small difference is due to rounding. Note that option D corresponds to the position of the first minimum (`θ₁`), not the distance between minima.\n\n<<<C>>>"
