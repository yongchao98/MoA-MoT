    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species involved.**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    -   Free hydrated cobalt(II) ion: `[Co^2+]` (often written as `[Co(H2O)6]^2+`)\n    -   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    -   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    -   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n    -   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n    So, `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-`.\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (β) to relate the concentrations.**\n    The formation of each complex from the free metal ion and ligand is described by an overall stability constant `βn`:\n    `Co^2+ + nSCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`\n    `βn = [[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^n)`\n\n    We can express the concentration of each complex in terms of `[Co^2+]` and `[SCN-]`:\n    -   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    -   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    -   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    -   `[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n3.  **Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration.**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n    Factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n4.  **Determine the formula for the fraction of the desired complex.**\n    The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`. The fraction of this complex (let's call it `α_2`) is given by `[Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`.\n    `α_2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n    `α_2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Plug in the given values and calculate the result.**\n    Given values:\n    -   `[SCN-] = 0.1` M (The concentration of thiocyanate is much larger than cobalt, so we assume this is the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand).\n    -   `β1 = 9`\n    -   `β2 = 40`\n    -   `β3 = 63`\n    -   `β4 = 16`\n\n    First, calculate the denominator (let's call it `Σ`):\n    `Σ = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\n    `Σ = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    `Σ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    `Σ = 2.3646`\n\n    Next, calculate the numerator for `α_2`:\n    Numerator = `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Now, calculate the fraction `α_2`:\n    `α_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n6.  **Convert the fraction to a percentage.**\n    Percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` = `α_2 * 100%`\n    Percentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
