    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Combined Observational Constraints**\n\nFor a star to be observable by both instruments, it must meet the criteria for both location (visibility from both hemispheres) and brightness (apparent magnitude).\n\n**1. Visibility (Declination Constraint):**\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located in Chile at a latitude of approximately 24° South. It can observe the southern sky and the northern sky up to a certain declination.\n*   **Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located in Hawaii at a latitude of approximately 20° North. It can observe the northern sky and the southern sky down to a certain declination.\n*   The problem states to disregard pointing limits like minimum elevation. This simplifies the visibility check: a star must simply rise above the horizon for both locations.\n    *   For Keck (Lat ≈ +20° N), an object must have a declination greater than +20° - 90° = **-70°**.\n    *   For Paranal (Lat ≈ -24° S), an object must have a declination less than -24° + 90° = **+66°**.\n*   **Combined Visibility Condition:** The star's declination (DEC) must be in the overlapping range: **-70° < DEC < +66°**.\n\n**2. Brightness (Magnitude Constraint):**\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 mag (V < 17).\n*   **HIRES:** Can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag (V < 16).\n*   **Combined Magnitude Condition:** To be observed by both, the star must be brighter than the stricter limit. Therefore, its apparent V magnitude must be **V < 16 mag**.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Each Star**\n\nWe will now check each star against these two combined conditions. We need to find each star's Declination (DEC) and its observed apparent V magnitude (m_V).\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = **-75°**. This is outside the required range of -70° < DEC < +66° because it is too far south to be seen from Keck.\n*   **Conclusion:** **FAILS** (not visible from Keck).\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = **+55°**. This is within the required range.\n*   **Magnitude:** Apparent V magnitude is given as **16.5 mag**. This is not brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** **FAILS** (too faint for HIRES).\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = **+48°**. This is within the required range.\n*   **Magnitude:** The problem states its \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag\". This is the observed magnitude. m_V = **15.5 mag**. This is brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** **PASSES** both conditions.\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = **-48°**. This is within the required range.\n*   **Magnitude:** We must calculate the observed apparent magnitude from the absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d), and extinction (A_V).\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc.\n    *   First, calculate the unreddened apparent magnitude: m = M_V + 5*log10(d/10pc) = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15.5 mag.\n    *   Next, calculate the extinction: A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   The observed magnitude is m_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**. This is not brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** **FAILS** (too faint for HIRES).\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = **+60°**. This is within the required range.\n*   **Magnitude:** We must calculate the observed apparent magnitude from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d). No extinction is mentioned.\n    *   M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc.\n    *   m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5*log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5*(0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**.\n    *   This is brighter than 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** **PASSES** both conditions.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Answer**\n\nThe stars that meet the conditions for observation by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<A>>>"
