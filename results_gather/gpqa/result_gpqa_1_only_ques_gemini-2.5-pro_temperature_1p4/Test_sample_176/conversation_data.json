    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n**2. Identify Key Physical Principles**\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The total power radiated (luminosity, L) by a black body is proportional to its surface area (A) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4 = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The wavelength at which a black body emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max, emitted}$) is inversely proportional to its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    $\\lambda_{max, emitted} = b/T$\n    where b is Wien's constant.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving with a radial velocity $v_r$ (positive if receding), the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emitted}$) by:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted}(1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^5$ km/s).\n\n**3. Set up the Luminosity Ratio**\n\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**4. Use the Given Information**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    Substituting this into the equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n*   **Mass Information:** The mass information ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not directly used in the black-body radiation laws and is likely included as a distractor.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** To find the temperature ratio ($\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$), we must use the information about the peak emission wavelengths. The problem states that the \"wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the **observed** peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max, obs}$).\n    So, $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n\n**5. Relate Temperature to Observed Wavelength**\n\nWe need to connect the observed peak wavelength to the star's intrinsic temperature using the Doppler effect and Wien's Law.\n\n*   **For Star_1:**\n    The radial velocity is $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s. There is no Doppler shift.\n    $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emitted, 1}$\n    From Wien's Law, $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{max, emitted, 1}$. So, $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{max, obs, 1}$.\n\n*   **For Star_2:**\n    The radial velocity is $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. The light is redshifted.\n    $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emitted, 2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    From Wien's Law, $T_2 = b / \\lambda_{max, emitted, 2}$. So, $\\lambda_{max, emitted, 2} = b / T_2$.\n    Substituting this into the Doppler equation:\n    $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = (\\frac{b}{T_2}) (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n*   **Find the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Since $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$:\n    $\\frac{b}{T_1} = (\\frac{b}{T_2}) (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    $\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    Rearranging to find the temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\n\nNow substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c} \\right)^4$\n\nPlug in the values for $v_{r,2}$ and c:\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s\n*   $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{700}{300000}} \\right)^4$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{7}{3000}} \\right)^4$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{3000}{3007} \\right)^4$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times (0.997672)^4$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.99072$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.22912$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the factor is approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>"
