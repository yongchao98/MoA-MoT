    "1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** The starting molecule is **5-butylnona-2,6-diene**.\n    *   `nona`: A 9-carbon parent chain.\n    *   `-2,6-diene`: Double bonds are located between C2-C3 and C6-C7.\n    *   `5-butyl`: A butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to C5.\n    *   Let's draw the structure:\n        ```\n             CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃\n            ¹   ²   ³   ⁴  ⁵   ⁶   ⁷   ⁸   ⁹\n                                |\n                               CH₂\n                               |\n                               CH₂\n                               |\n                               CH₂\n                               |\n                               CH₃\n        ```\n        The chemical formula is C₁₃H₂₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:** The molecule is heated. The structure `C=C-C-C-C=C` is a 1,5-diene system. Heating a 1,5-diene typically leads to a **Cope rearrangement**, which is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement:**\n    *   The 1,5-diene system involved in the rearrangement consists of atoms C2 through C7: `C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)`.\n    *   In a Cope rearrangement, the sigma bond between atoms 3 and 4 of the 1,5-diene system breaks, and a new sigma bond forms between atoms 1 and 6. The π-bonds shift accordingly.\n    *   Let's re-number the atoms of our system for clarity during the rearrangement:\n        `C(2)=C(3)-C(4) -- C(5)-C(6)=C(7)`\n        ` 1  = 2  - 3 ` `--` ` 4  - 5  = 6 ` (using the general 1-6 numbering for a 1,5-diene)\n        *   The C(4)-C(5) sigma bond (bond between 3 and 4) will **break**.\n        *   A new sigma bond between C(2) and C(7) (bond between 1 and 6) will **form**.\n        *   The π-bond at C(2)=C(3) will shift to **C(3)=C(4)**.\n        *   The π-bond at C(6)=C(7) will shift to **C(5)=C(6)**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:** Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms and groups in the product.\n    *   **Original groups attached to the C2-C7 system:**\n        *   On C2: a methyl group (-CH₃, from C1)\n        *   On C4: two hydrogen atoms\n        *   On C5: a butyl group (-C₄H₉) and a hydrogen atom\n        *   On C7: an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃, from C8 and C9)\n    *   **New connectivity:** Let's assemble the product based on the new bonds.\n        ```\n           (Methyl)-C(2) --- C(7)-(Ethyl)\n                   /           \\\n                 C(3)=C(4)       C(6)=C(5)-(Butyl)\n        ```\n    *   **Draw the full structure of the product:**\n        ```\n             CH₃     CH₂CH₃\n              |       |\n        CH₂=CH-CH------CH-CH=C-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃\n        ```\n\n5.  **Name the Product (IUPAC nomenclature):**\n    *   **Find the longest carbon chain** containing the principal functional groups (the double bonds).\n        Let's trace the possibilities:\n        a) Start from the leftmost `CH₂=`. The chain goes through C3, C2, C7, C6, C5 and then into the butyl group.\n        `CH₂(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH(5)=C(6)-CH₂(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₂(9)-CH₃(10)`\n        This chain is 10 carbons long. It contains both double bonds. This is our parent chain.\n    *   **Number the parent chain** to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants.\n        Numbering from the left as shown above gives the double bonds at positions 1 and 5 (`deca-1,5-diene`). Numbering from the right would give positions 5 and 9 (`deca-5,9-diene`). So, we use the `deca-1,5-diene` numbering.\n    *   **Identify and name the substituents.**\n        *   There is a methyl group (-CH₃) on carbon 3. -> **3-methyl**\n        *   There is an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) on carbon 4. -> **4-ethyl**\n    *   **Assemble the full name**, listing substituents alphabetically.\n        **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene - **This matches our derived name.**\n    *   B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   C) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   D) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n\nThe product formed is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
