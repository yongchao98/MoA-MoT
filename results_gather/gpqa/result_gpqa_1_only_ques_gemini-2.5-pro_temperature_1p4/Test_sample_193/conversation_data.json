    "Here is a step-by-step solution to find the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. The total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^3 = 8$.\n\nWe need to list all 8 possible states and calculate the energy for each one.\n\n**2. The Energy Equation**\n\nThe energy of the system for a given state is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\n\nLet's systematically list all 8 states and calculate their corresponding energies. A state is represented by the triplet (S1, S2, S3).\n\n*   **State 1: All spins up (+1, +1, +1)**\n    E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n\n*   **State 2: All spins down (-1, -1, -1)**\n    E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n\nThese two states have the same energy, E₁ = -3J. The degeneracy (number of states with this energy) is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **States with two spins up and one spin down:**\n    *   (+1, +1, -1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   (+1, -1, +1): E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   (-1, +1, +1): E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\nThere are 3 states of this type.\n\n*   **States with one spin up and two spins down:**\n    *   (+1, -1, -1): E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   (-1, +1, -1): E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   (-1, -1, +1): E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\nThere are 3 states of this type.\n\nCombining these, we have a total of 3 + 3 = 6 states that all have the same energy, E₂ = +J. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n**4. The Partition Function (Z)**\n\nThe partition function is the sum over all states (i) of the Boltzmann factor, $e^{-\\beta E_i}$. We can simplify this by grouping states with the same energy:\nZ = $\\sum_{levels} g_i e^{-\\beta E_i}$\n\nUsing our calculated energy levels and their degeneracies:\n*   Energy Level 1: E₁ = -3J, g₁ = 2\n*   Energy Level 2: E₂ = +J, g₂ = 6\n\nZ = $g_1 e^{-\\beta E_1} + g_2 e^{-\\beta E_2}$\nZ = $2 \\cdot e^{-\\beta(-3J)} + 6 \\cdot e^{-\\beta(+J)}$\nZ = $2 e^{3J\\beta} + 6 e^{-J\\beta}$\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nLet's check our result against the given choices:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function, $Z = 2 e^{3J\\beta} + 6 e^{-J\\beta}$, matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
