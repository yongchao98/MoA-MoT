    "Here is the step-by-step solution to determine the energy of the nucleus.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties**\n\n*   The nucleus is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons), which is the mass number (A), is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n*   So, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Energy (E₀) of the Nucleus**\n\nIn high-energy physics problems, the rest mass of a nucleus can be approximated by multiplying its mass number (A) by the mass of a nucleon. To match the precision of the given options, we use the mass of a neutron.\n\n*   Mass number (A) = 6\n*   Rest mass of a neutron ($m_n$) ≈ 939.565 MeV/c²\n*   The rest energy of the nucleus ($E_0$) is its rest mass ($m_0$) multiplied by the speed of light squared ($c^2$): $E_0 = m_0 c^2$.\n*   $E_0 \\approx A \\times (m_n c^2) = 6 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $E_0 \\approx 5637.39 \\text{ MeV} = 5.63739 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is a function of the object's speed (v). It is used to calculate relativistic effects.\n\n*   Speed (v) = 0.96c\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n*   Substitute the value of v: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}}$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is the product of its Lorentz factor and its rest energy.\n\n*   The formula for total energy is: $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n*   $E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5.63739 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $E \\approx 20.1335 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated value is E ≈ 20.1335 GeV. Comparing this with the given choices:\n*   A) 20.132 GeV\n*   B) 18.475 GeV\n*   C) 21.419 GeV\n*   D) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference (0.0015 GeV) is due to rounding and the specific constant value used for the neutron mass.\n\n<<<A>>>"
