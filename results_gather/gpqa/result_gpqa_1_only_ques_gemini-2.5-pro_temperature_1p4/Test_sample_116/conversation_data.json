    "Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In biphenyls, if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. For the molecule to be chiral, rotation must be restricted, and each ring must be unsymmetrically substituted such that the molecule as a whole does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar. Due to this restricted rotation, the molecule is locked in a chiral conformation. It does not have a plane of symmetry, and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This is an ester also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is diphenyl ketone, (C₆H₅)₂CO.\n    *   The central carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), so it is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioate, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   It also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. (It does show *geometric* isomerism, but not optical isomerism).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the one that includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
