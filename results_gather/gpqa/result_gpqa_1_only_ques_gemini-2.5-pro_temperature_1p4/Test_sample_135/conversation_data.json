    "This problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f(r)` within a sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and points in the radial direction. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Identify the Goal**\n\nWe need to evaluate the integral:\n`I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**3. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field over the boundary of the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\nwhere `S` is the closed surface bounding the volume `V`.\n\n**Important Consideration:** The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field `f` to be well-defined and differentiable everywhere inside the volume `V`. In our case, `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat` is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r = 0`), which is inside our sphere.\n\nThere are two common ways to handle this singularity:\n\n**Method 1: Direct application of the theorem (Gauss's Law analogy)**\n\nIn physics, this type of problem is very common (e.g., Gauss's Law for a point charge). The integral `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV` is understood to be equal to the net flux out of the bounding surface `S`, even with the singularity inside. Let's proceed with this interpretation.\n\n*   The surface `S` is the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The vector field on this surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere points radially outward, so `dS = dS * r_hat`.\n*   The dot product `f ⋅ dS` is:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [dS * r_hat] = (1/R^2) * dS` (since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`)\n\nNow, we evaluate the surface integral:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n\nSince `R` is constant on the surface, `1/R^2` is also constant and can be taken out of the integral:\n`= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\nThe integral `∮_S dS` is just the total surface area of the sphere, which is `4πR^2`.\n\n`= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2) = 4π`\n\n**Method 2: Calculating the Divergence Directly**\n\nWe can calculate the divergence of `f(r)` in spherical coordinates. For `f = f_r * r_hat`, the divergence is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`.\nHere, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\n\nThis result `∇ ⋅ f = 0` is valid for all `r ≠ 0`. At `r = 0`, the divergence is undefined. This type of situation, where the divergence is zero everywhere except at a single point where the source of the field is located, is described by the Dirac delta function. The divergence of this particular field is known to be:\n`∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`\nwhere `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we evaluate the volume integral:\n`I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\n\nBy the definition of the delta function, integrating it over a volume that contains the origin (`r=0`) yields 1.\n`I = 4π * ∫_V δ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The value of the integral is `4π`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
