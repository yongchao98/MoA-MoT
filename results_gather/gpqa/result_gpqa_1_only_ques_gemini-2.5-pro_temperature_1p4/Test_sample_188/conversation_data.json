    "Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a phenomenon where the ground state of a system lacks a symmetry that is present in the underlying laws of physics (the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian). According to Goldstone's theorem, when a continuous global symmetry is spontaneously broken, massless (or nearly massless in the case of approximate symmetries) particles, known as Goldstone bosons, must appear. Let's analyze each option in this context:\n\nA) **Magnon:** A magnon is a quantum of a spin wave. In a ferromagnet, the underlying physical laws are rotationally symmetric. However, in the ground state, all the magnetic moments align in a specific, arbitrary direction. This choice of direction spontaneously breaks the continuous rotational symmetry. The magnons are the collective excitations corresponding to this broken symmetry, and in the long-wavelength limit, they behave as massless Goldstone bosons. Therefore, magnons are associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\nB) **Pion:** Pions (or pi mesons) are particles in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In the limit of massless up and down quarks, QCD possesses an approximate continuous symmetry called chiral symmetry. This symmetry is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum. The pions are the (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons that emerge from this symmetry breaking. They are not exactly massless because the quarks do have a small mass, which explicitly breaks the symmetry, but they are significantly lighter than other hadrons. Therefore, pions are associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\nD) **Phonon:** A phonon is a quantum of vibrational energy in a crystal lattice. The laws of physics governing the atoms are invariant under continuous translation in space. However, a crystal lattice structure, the ground state, is only invariant under a *discrete* set of translations. This means the continuous translational symmetry is spontaneously broken. The acoustic phonons are the resulting Goldstone bosons, which are massless (their energy goes to zero as their momentum goes to zero). Therefore, phonons are associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\nC) **Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is a type of topological soliton. It is a stable, particle-like, non-linear excitation in a field theory. While skyrmions were originally proposed in a model of pions (which are Goldstone bosons), and they also appear as topological textures in the spin field of certain magnets (where magnons are the Goldstone bosons), the skyrmion itself is *not* a Goldstone boson. It is a massive, non-perturbative object whose existence is guaranteed by the topology of the theory's vacuum manifold, not directly by Goldstone's theorem. While the field it is made of is a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the skyrmion itself is a different kind of entity. Unlike magnons, pions, and phonons, it is not the fundamental quantum of the broken symmetry mode.\n\nTherefore, the magnon, pion, and phonon are all examples of Goldstone bosons that arise directly from a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. The skyrmion is a different type of effective particle (a topological soliton) and not the Goldstone boson itself.\n\n<<<C>>>"
