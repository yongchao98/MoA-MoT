    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Process:** The textile dye absorbs light energy, causing an electron to move to a higher energy level (excited state). The molecule then loses some of this energy through non-radiative processes (like vibrations) before releasing the remaining energy as a photon of light. This emitted light is what we see as fluorescence or phosphorescence. This entire process is known as photoluminescence.\n\n2.  **Energy Relationship:** Because some energy is lost before emission, the energy of the absorbed light must be *greater* than the energy of the emitted light.\n    *   E_absorbed > E_emitted\n\n3.  **Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light:** We are given the energy of the emitted light, E_emitted = 2.3393 eV. We can calculate the corresponding wavelength (λ) using the formula:\n    λ (in nm) = 1240 / E (in eV)\n    λ_emitted = 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\n4.  **Determine the Color of Emitted Light:** We need to find where this wavelength falls on the visible light spectrum:\n    *   Violet: 400-450 nm\n    *   Blue: 450-495 nm\n    *   Green: 495-570 nm\n    *   Yellow: 570-590 nm\n    *   Orange: 590-620 nm\n    *   Red: 620-750 nm\n    A wavelength of 530 nm falls squarely in the **green** region. So, the dye emits green light.\n\n5.  **Determine the Color of Absorbed Light:** Since E_absorbed > E_emitted, it follows that the wavelength of the absorbed light must be *shorter* than the wavelength of the emitted light.\n    *   λ_absorbed < λ_emitted\n    *   λ_absorbed < 530 nm\n\n6.  **Analyze the Options:** We need to find which of the given colors has a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. Let's list the colors in order of increasing energy (decreasing wavelength):\n    Red → Yellow → Green → **Blue** → Violet\n\n    The dye emits green light. Therefore, it must absorb light with higher energy (and shorter wavelength). Looking at the options, both Blue and Violet have higher energy than Green. However, in fluorescence, the absorption and emission bands are typically close to each other (a phenomenon described by the Stokes shift). The color with the next highest energy after green is blue. Therefore, the dye most likely absorbs blue light to emit green light.\n\n    *   A) **Blue:** Wavelength is ~450-495 nm. This is < 530 nm. (Correct)\n    *   B) **Yellow:** Wavelength is ~570-590 nm. This is > 530 nm. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) **Red:** Wavelength is ~620-750 nm. This is > 530 nm. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) **Violet:** Wavelength is ~400-450 nm. While this is < 530 nm, blue is the adjacent color in the spectrum with higher energy, making it the most probable answer for a typical fluorescent dye.\n\nThe absorbed light is blue.\n\n<<<A>>>"
