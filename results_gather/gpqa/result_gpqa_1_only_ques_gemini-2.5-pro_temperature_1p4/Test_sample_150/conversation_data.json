    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to find the probability.\n\n**1. Understand the Theory**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of measuring an observable are the eigenvalues of its corresponding operator. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue λ for a system in a state |ψ⟩ is given by Born's rule. The formula is:\n\nP(λ) = |⟨E_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩⟨E_λ|E_λ⟩)\n\nWhere:\n*   |ψ⟩ is the state vector of the system.\n*   λ is the eigenvalue we are interested in.\n*   |E_λ⟩ is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ.\n*   ⟨v|w⟩ represents the inner product of vectors v and w.\n*   ⟨v|v⟩ is the squared norm of the vector v.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   The state vector of the system is |ψ⟩ = `(  -1  )`\n                                        `(   2   )`\n                                        `(   1   )`\n*   The observable operator is P = `( 0, 1/√2, 0 )`\n                                  `( 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 )`\n                                  `( 0, 1/√2, 0 )`\n*   We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue λ = 0.\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvalues of P**\n\nTo confirm that 0 is a possible outcome, we find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.\n\ndet `( -λ, 1/√2, 0 )`\n    `( 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 )` = 0\n    `( 0, 1/√2, -λ )`\n\n-λ * ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2) * ((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) = 0\n-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0\n-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0\n-λ³ + λ = 0\nλ(1 - λ²) = 0\nλ(1 - λ)(1 + λ) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1. Since 0 is an eigenvalue, it is a possible measurement outcome.\n\n**4. Find the Eigenvector for λ = 0**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector |E₀⟩ that satisfies the equation P|E₀⟩ = 0|E₀⟩, which simplifies to P|E₀⟩ = 0.\nLet |E₀⟩ = `(x, y, z)`ᵀ.\n\n`( 0, 1/√2, 0 )` `(x)`   `(0)`\n`( 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 )` `(y)` = `(0)`\n`( 0, 1/√2, 0 )` `(z)`   `(0)`\n\nThis gives us the system of linear equations:\n1.  (1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0\n2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n3.  (1/√2)y = 0 (this is redundant)\n\nThe eigenvector has the form (x, 0, -x). We can choose a simple non-zero vector for our calculations by setting x = 1.\nSo, the eigenvector for λ = 0 is |E₀⟩ = `( 1 )`\n                                      `( 0 )`\n                                      `(-1 )`\n\n**5. Calculate the Components for the Probability Formula**\n\nNow we calculate the necessary terms for the formula P(0) = |⟨E₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩⟨E₀|E₀⟩).\n\n*   **⟨E₀|ψ⟩**: This is the inner product. ⟨E₀| is the conjugate transpose of |E₀⟩. Since the elements are real, it's just the transpose `(1, 0, -1)`.\n    ⟨E₀|ψ⟩ = `(1, 0, -1)` * `(-1)` = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2.\n                         `( 2)`\n                         `( 1)`\n\n*   **|⟨E₀|ψ⟩|²**: This is the squared magnitude of the inner product.\n    |⟨E₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4.\n\n*   **⟨ψ|ψ⟩**: This is the squared norm of the state vector.\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = `(-1, 2, 1)` * `(-1)` = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n                           `( 2)`\n                           `( 1)`\n\n*   **⟨E₀|E₀⟩**: This is the squared norm of the eigenvector.\n    ⟨E₀|E₀⟩ = `(1, 0, -1)` * `( 1)` = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.\n                            `( 0)`\n                            `(-1)`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nNow, we substitute these values back into the probability formula:\n\nP(0) = |⟨E₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩⟨E₀|E₀⟩)\nP(0) = 4 / (6 * 2)\nP(0) = 4 / 12\nP(0) = 1/3\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
