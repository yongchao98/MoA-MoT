    "This is a common phrase used by synthetic chemists, and it almost always refers to a problem with purification, specifically chromatography.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIn a synthetic chemistry lab, the most common method for purifying and analyzing mixtures of compounds is **chromatography**, such as Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography. In these techniques, compounds are separated based on their affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) versus a mobile phase (a solvent).\n\nThis affinity is primarily determined by the **polarity** of the compounds.\n*   More polar compounds stick more tightly to the polar stationary phase (silica gel) and move more slowly.\n*   Less polar compounds are more soluble in the less polar mobile phase and move more quickly.\n\nWhen a chemist says their compounds are \"on top of each other,\" they mean that during a chromatographic separation, the different compounds in their mixture are moving at the same rate. On a TLC plate, this would appear as a single spot instead of multiple, distinct spots. In column chromatography, it means the compounds elute from the column together in the same fractions. This happens when the compounds have very **similar polarities**, making them extremely difficult to separate using this technique.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are less likely:\n*   **A) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for separation by distillation, not chromatography. While a valid issue, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of spots on a TLC plate.\n*   **B) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a physical property used to characterize chiral molecules; it is not a separation technique.\n*   **C) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions:** While these interactions are the underlying cause of physical properties like polarity and boiling point, the statement is describing the *result* of a failed separation, which is most directly attributed to the compounds having similar polarities.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is complaining that the compounds have similar polarities, making them inseparable by standard chromatography.\n\n<<<D>>>"
