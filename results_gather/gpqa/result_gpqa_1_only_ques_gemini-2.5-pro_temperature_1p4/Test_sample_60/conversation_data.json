    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** Nitration of benzene. This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) generates the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene (a benzene ring with a -NO2 group).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** Bromination of nitrobenzene. This is another electrophilic aromatic substitution. Iron powder acts as a catalyst with Br2 to form the electrophile.\n*   **Starting Material:** Nitrobenzene\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It withdraws electron density from the ring, making the ortho and para positions electron-poor. Therefore, the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add to the meta position.\n*   **Product 2:** 3-bromonitrobenzene (or m-bromonitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction selectively reduces the nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2) without affecting the aryl-bromine bond under these standard conditions.\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-bromonitrobenzene\n*   **Product 3:** 3-bromoaniline (or m-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reaction:** Diazotization. Primary aromatic amines react with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and a strong acid like HBF4) to form a diazonium salt. The use of HBF4 specifically forms an arenediazonium tetrafluoroborate salt.\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-bromoaniline\n*   **Product 4:** 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate. The structure is a benzene ring with a diazonium group (-N2+) at position 1 and a bromine atom at position 3.\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.**\n*   **Reaction:** Gomberg-Bachmann reaction. This reaction couples two aromatic rings. The diazonium salt (Product 4) decomposes upon heating to form a 3-bromophenyl radical. This radical then attacks the other aromatic compound, anisole (methoxybenzene).\n*   **Starting Materials:** 3-bromobenzenediazonium salt and Anisole (methoxybenzene).\n*   **Directing Effect:** Anisole has a methoxy group (-OCH3), which is an activating group and an **ortho, para-director**. The radical attack will occur at the positions ortho or para to the methoxy group. Due to less steric hindrance, the **para-substituted product is the major product**.\n*   **Final Product Formation:** The 3-bromophenyl group attaches to the para position (C4) of anisole. The resulting molecule is a biphenyl derivative where a 3-bromophenyl ring is connected to a 4-methoxyphenyl ring.\n*   **Final Product 5:** 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\nA) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. This would be the minor product from ortho attack on anisole.\nB) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. This would require a fluorine atom, which is not introduced in the reaction with anisole.\nC) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Correct. This matches the major product from para attack on anisole by the 3-bromophenyl radical.\nD) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. This would require the initial bromination to occur at the para position, but the nitro group is a meta-director.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n<<<C>>>"
