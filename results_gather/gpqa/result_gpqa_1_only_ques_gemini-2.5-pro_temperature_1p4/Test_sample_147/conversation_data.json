    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the information about substance A2.**\n    We are given that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the formula YF_m. The mass fraction of fluorine (ωF) in A2 is 31.96% (or 0.3196).\n    The formula for mass fraction is:\n    ωF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))\n    where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (≈ 19 g/mol), and 'm' is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for M(Y):\n    M(Y) = m * M(F) * (1/ωF - 1)\n    M(Y) = m * 19 * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M(Y) = m * 19 * (3.1289 - 1)\n    M(Y) = m * 19 * 2.1289\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m\n\n2.  **Use the relationship M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m to find possible identities for Y.**\n    We can test integer values for 'm' (the oxidation state of Y in A2) and see if the resulting M(Y) corresponds to a known element.\n    *   If m = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. (Closest element is Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If m = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. (Close to Br, Se, Kr).\n    *   If m = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.3 g/mol. (Close to Sb).\n    *   If m = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. (Very close to Dysprosium, Dy, M=162.5 g/mol).\n    *   If m = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. (Close to Bi, Pb).\n    *   If m = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. (Close to Pu, Am).\n\n3.  **Analyze the information about substances A4 and A5.**\n    We are told: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    The reaction is: Y + A4 → A5. Since Y is in its elemental form (oxidation state 0) and A4 and A5 are both fluorides of Y, this is a comproportionation reaction. Let A4 = YF_n. The most straightforward interpretation of a 1:1 molar ratio leading to a single product A5 is:\n    Y(0) + Y(n+)F_n → 2 Y(n/2+)F_{n/2}\n    This means that A5 = YF_{n/2}, and importantly, the number of fluorine atoms 'n' in A4 must be an even number. A4 is also described as forming a colorless solution.\n\n4.  **Test the candidate Y = Dysprosium (Dy).**\n    From step 2, the case m=4 gave an excellent match for Dysprosium (Dy).\n    Let's test this hypothesis:\n    *   Y = Dy (M = 162.5 g/mol).\n    *   m = 162.5 / 40.45 = 4.017, which is extremely close to 4.\n    *   This suggests A2 is DyF4. Let's verify the mass fraction for DyF4:\n        M(DyF4) = 162.5 + 4 * 19 = 238.5 g/mol.\n        ωF(DyF4) = (4 * 19) / 238.5 = 76 / 238.5 = 0.3186 (or 31.86%).\n        This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that A2 = DyF4 is a very strong possibility.\n    *   Now let's find A4. According to the reaction logic in step 3, A4 must be YF_n where 'n' is an even number. Let's propose A4 = DyF4 (where n=4, which is even).\n    *   The reaction would be: Dy + DyF4 → 2 DyF2. A5 would be DyF2. This is a plausible chemical reaction.\n    *   The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We identified A4 as DyF4.\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 = DyF4 is 238.5 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 238.5 g/mol. Let's check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 238.5 falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    Although some qualitative descriptions in the problem (like the red color of A1, the oxidation of xenon, and the existence of five fluorides) conflict with the known chemistry of Dysprosium, the quantitative data points strongly and consistently to Dysprosium. The mass percentage of fluorine in A2 perfectly matches DyF4, and identifying A4 as DyF4 leads to a molecular weight that fits exactly into one of the provided answer ranges. Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the numerical data is that A4 is DyF4.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (DyF4) is 238.5 g/mol, which is in the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
