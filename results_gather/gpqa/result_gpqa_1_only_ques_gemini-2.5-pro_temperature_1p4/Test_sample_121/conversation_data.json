    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the final product and its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid to Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. The conditions are a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid (the methyl group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid group is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 to Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-stage alkylation process followed by an intramolecular cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (an enolate) attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization:** The problem states **excess** NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the remaining α-proton on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  The resulting molecule contains both a nucleophilic carbanion and an electrophilic carbon (-CH₂Br) at the other end of the chain. It undergoes a rapid intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the carbon with the bromine, closing a ring. The ring is formed from the α-carbon plus the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n     \n\n**¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C1 (the carbon with the substituents) and C4 (the carbon opposite C1).\n\nThis plane of symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent:\n*   The protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C6.\n*   The protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH₂-) are chemically equivalent (enantiotopic) because of the plane of symmetry. **(1 signal)**\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** These carbons are equivalent. On each carbon, there is an axial-type proton and an equatorial-type proton. These two types are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). Therefore:\n        *   The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other. **(1 signal)**\n        *   The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **C3 and C5:** These carbons are equivalent and are further from the substituents than C2/C6. The same logic applies:\n        *   The two axial-type protons (one on C3, one on C5) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   The two equatorial-type protons (one on C3, one on C5) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **C4:** This carbon is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. It has an axial-type proton and an equatorial-type proton. These two protons are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic) and are not equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 1 (CH₂) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\n<<<A>>>"
