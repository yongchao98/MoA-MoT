    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons. We are considering only their orbital angular momentum.\n    *   Electron 1 is in a p orbital, so its orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l_1 = 1$. The possible values for its z-component quantum number are $m_{l1} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Electron 2 is also in a p orbital, so $l_2 = 1$. The possible values for its z-component quantum number are $m_{l2} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. Here, $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m=-1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:**\n    We are making a joint measurement of the z-components of the individual angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ are $m_{l1}\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of $L_{2z}$ are $m_{l2}\\hbar$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Desired Outcome:**\n    We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   So, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    The total angular momentum operator in the z-direction, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual operators:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\n    This relationship also holds for their quantum numbers. A coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination (superposition) of uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$. A fundamental selection rule for this expansion is that the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers must equal the total z-component quantum number:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n    Any uncoupled state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ that does not satisfy this condition cannot be a part of the superposition that forms the coupled state $|l, m>$. Its coefficient in the expansion will be zero.\n\n5.  **Check the Condition for the Desired Outcome:**\n    *   The given state is $|l=2, m=-1>$, so the total z-component quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome corresponds to $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the sum rule is satisfied: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    We see that the sum of the desired individual quantum numbers ($-2$) is not equal to the total quantum number of the system ($-1$).\n    $-2 \\neq -1$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring a particular outcome $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $P(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = |<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>|^2$\n\n    For our specific case:\n    $P(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$\n\n    Because the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$ is zero.\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    It is physically impossible for a system with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ to yield measurement results for its components that sum to $-2\\hbar$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
