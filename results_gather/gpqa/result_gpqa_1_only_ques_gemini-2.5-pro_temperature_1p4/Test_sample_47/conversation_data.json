    "This problem requires us to follow a four-step reaction sequence and then determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product by analyzing its symmetry.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis is the acid-catalyzed (often by trace HBr) alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone is a symmetrical ketone, so bromination occurs at one of the equivalent alpha-carbons (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH/heat → Product 2**\nThis is a reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH). The conditions are classic for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\nIn this reaction, the base abstracts a proton from the other α-carbon (C6). The resulting enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one). The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate. The subsequent ring-opening of the cyclopropanone ring results in a ring contraction. The most stable product is formed, which is a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group (after neutralization/workup).\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*(Note: An E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is also possible, but it does not react in a standard way with thionyl chloride in the next step. The Favorskii rearrangement is the most plausible pathway given the entire sequence.)*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) / Pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. Its most common and specific use in organic synthesis is the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Due to rapid conformational flipping (pseudorotation) at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon of the ring it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the rest of the ring.\n\nLet's label the protons and identify the unique sets:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 set)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the only proton directly attached to the ring at the point of substitution (a methine proton). It is unique. (1 set)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. Each of these carbons has two protons. The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is cis and one is trans to the aldehyde group, in a simplified view). They are not equivalent to each other. The same applies to C5. The cis-proton on C2 is equivalent to the cis-proton on C5, and the trans-proton on C2 is equivalent to the trans-proton on C5. Therefore, these four protons form two distinct sets. (2 sets)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Like C2/C5, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. These four protons also form two distinct sets. These sets are different from the C2/C5 protons because they are further from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group. (2 sets)\n\nCounting the total number of sets of chemically distinct hydrogens:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde-H (1 proton)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1 proton)\n*   Set 3: C2-H & C5-H (cis) (2 protons)\n*   Set 4: C2-H & C5-H (trans) (2 protons)\n*   Set 5: C3-H & C4-H (cis) (2 protons)\n*   Set 6: C3-H & C4-H (trans) (2 protons)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
