    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Principle:** The problem assumes the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This means the population of atoms in different energy states is described by the **Boltzmann distribution**.\n\n2.  **Write the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower state `i` (N_i) is given by:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / kT)\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the states (E_j - E_i).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n    *   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights of the states.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:** Let's define the \"excitation\" as the ratio of atoms in the excited state to atoms in a lower state (e.g., the ground state). We can write this for both stars:\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T_1): (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / kT_1)\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T_2): (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / kT_2)\n\n4.  **Use the Information from the Problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 4.\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / kT_1) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / kT_2) ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the Equation:** The statistical weights (g_j / g_i) are properties of the iron atom's energy levels and are the same for both stars, so they cancel out.\n    exp(-ΔE / kT_1) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT_2)\n\n7.  **Isolate the Temperatures:** To solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides.\n    ln[ exp(-ΔE / kT_1) ] = ln[ 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT_2) ]\n\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(e^x) = x and ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n    -ΔE / kT_1 = ln(2) + ln[ exp(-ΔE / kT_2) ]\n    -ΔE / kT_1 = ln(2) - ΔE / kT_2\n\n8.  **Rearrange the Equation:** Let's rearrange to solve for ln(2).\n    ΔE / kT_2 - ΔE / kT_1 = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parentheses:\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Substitute the Given Numerical Values:**\n    The problem gives the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n    The problem is designed so that the ratio (ΔE / k) is:\n    (ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value back into our equation:\n    (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
