    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical reactions and the resulting analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Reactions\n\nThe two-step reaction sequence involves:\n1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** This is a stereospecific **syn-addition** of an oxygen atom across the double bond. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (cis or trans) is preserved in the resulting epoxide.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide (hydrolysis):** This reaction proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism, which results in **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n\nThe overall transformation from the alkene to the diol is an **anti-dihydroxylation**. The stereochemical outcome of an anti-addition depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene. There's a useful mnemonic for this: **\"Trans-Anti-Meso\"**.\n*   Addition of an **Anti** reagent to a **Trans** alkene gives a **Meso** product.\n*   It follows that addition of an **Anti** reagent to a **Cis** (Z) alkene gives a **Racemic** mixture (a pair of enantiomers).\n\nLet's apply these rules to the two reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene (trans)\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation\n*   **Product:** According to the \"Trans-Anti-Meso\" rule, the product is the meso-diol.\n    *   Octane-4,5-diol has two stereocenters at C4 and C5. The meso form is (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound. Let's call this **Compound M**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis)\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation\n*   **Product:** The rule dictates that the product is a racemic mixture.\n    *   This mixture consists of two enantiomers: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these **Compound R** and **Compound S**, respectively.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains all three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **Compound M:** meso-(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n2.  **Compound R:** (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n3.  **Compound S:** (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nNow let's consider the stereochemical relationships between these compounds:\n*   **Compound R** and **Compound S** are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   **Compound M** is a **diastereomer** of both Compound R and Compound S (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### Step 3: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\nThe mixture of these three compounds is analyzed on two different HPLC columns.\n\n**Analysis on a Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC Column:**\n*   Standard HPLC columns have an achiral stationary phase. They separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like M vs. R and M vs. S) have different physical properties and will have different retention times. Thus, Compound M will be separated from the R/S pair.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like R and S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by a standard column and will elute at the exact same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: Compound M (the meso-diol)\n    *   Peak 2: A co-eluting mixture of Compound R and Compound S (the racemic pair)\n\n**Analysis on a Chiral HPLC Column:**\n*   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation.\n*   A chiral column separates enantiomers, and it also separates diastereomers.\n*   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n*   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**:\n    *   Peak 1: Compound M\n    *   Peak 2: Compound R\n    *   Peak 3: Compound S\n    (The elution order will depend on the specific chiral column used).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nWait, let's recheck the options and my conclusion.\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nMy conclusion is 2 peaks (standard) and 3 peaks (chiral). This matches option **C**.\n\nLet's carefully re-read the options. My reasoning leads to 2 peaks on standard and 3 on chiral, which is exactly what option C states.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n- Product mixture: 1 meso compound, 1 pair of enantiomers (total 3 stereoisomers).\n- Standard HPLC separates diastereomers -> 2 peaks (meso, and enantiomeric pair).\n- Chiral HPLC separates all stereoisomers -> 3 peaks (meso, enantiomer 1, enantiomer 2).\n- Result: 2 peaks (standard), 3 peaks (chiral).\n\nThis confirms the choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
