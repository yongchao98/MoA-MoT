    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Scenario and Define Parameters**\n\n*   We have a star that rotates, showing two different faces to the observer: one unspotted hemisphere and one spotty hemisphere.\n*   The brightness we observe will be at a maximum ($F_{max}$) when the unspotted side faces us, and at a minimum ($F_{min}$) when the spotty side faces us.\n*   The amplitude of the brightness variation is the relative difference between these two fluxes: $\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = \\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}}$.\n*   We need to find the relative radius of a planet ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that would cause the same amplitude signal during a transit.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   Photosphere temperature, $T_{phot} = 6000$ K.\n*   Spot temperature, $T_{spot} = 6000 \\text{ K} - 1000 \\text{ K} = 5000$ K.\n*   Filling factor of spots on the spotty hemisphere, $\\alpha = 20\\% = 0.2$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Flux Variation Due to Spots**\n\nThe flux emitted by a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann Law: $F \\propto T^4$). We can compare the flux from the two hemispheres. Let's assume the projected area of the star's disk is A.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The entire disk has a temperature of $T_{phot}$.\n    $F_{max} \\propto A \\cdot T_{phot}^4$\n\n*   **Minimum Flux ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. A fraction $\\alpha=0.2$ of the area is covered by spots at $T_{spot}$, and the remaining fraction $(1-\\alpha)=0.8$ is at $T_{phot}$.\n    $F_{min} \\propto [ (1-\\alpha) \\cdot A \\cdot T_{phot}^4 ] + [ \\alpha \\cdot A \\cdot T_{spot}^4 ]$\n\nNow, we can calculate the relative flux drop (the amplitude of the signal):\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = \\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = \\frac{A \\cdot T_{phot}^4 - [ (1-\\alpha) A T_{phot}^4 + \\alpha A T_{spot}^4 ]}{A \\cdot T_{phot}^4}$\n\nCancel out the common term A:\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = \\frac{T_{phot}^4 - (1-\\alpha)T_{phot}^4 - \\alpha T_{spot}^4}{T_{phot}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = \\frac{T_{phot}^4 - T_{phot}^4 + \\alpha T_{phot}^4 - \\alpha T_{spot}^4}{T_{phot}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = \\frac{\\alpha T_{phot}^4 - \\alpha T_{spot}^4}{T_{phot}^4}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{phot}^4}\\right)$\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 0.2 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4\\right)$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 0.2 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4\\right)$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 0.2 \\left(1 - \\frac{625}{1296}\\right)$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 0.2 \\left(1 - 0.48225\\right)$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 0.2 \\times 0.51775$\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} \\approx 0.10355$\n\n**3. Equate to the Exoplanet Transit Signal**\n\nAn exoplanet transiting a star causes a dip in brightness equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area (assuming a dark planet and a uniformly bright star, which is consistent with the assumptions made above).\n$\\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\nWe need this transit depth to be equal to the amplitude of the signal from the spotty star.\n$\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = 0.10355$\n\n**4. Solve for the Relative Radius**\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root of the flux drop:\n$\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.10355}$\n$\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} \\approx 0.3218$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
