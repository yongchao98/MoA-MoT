    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the products of two separate reactions and then determining how those products will behave in two different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5, with an (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3`.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products:** The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces, leading to both (R) and (S) configurations at the newly formed alcohol center (C3).\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Products 1A and 1B have one identical chiral center (5S) and one opposite chiral center (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (`CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`).\n    *   This molecule is achiral. It has no chiral centers.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the products must be either achiral or a racemic mixture of chiral molecules. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are **enantiomers**. The reaction produces them in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's predict the number of peaks for each HPLC type.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Constitutional isomers and diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Let's count the separable groups:\n    1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is one distinct compound. (Peak 1)\n    2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is a diastereomer of the above compound, so it will have different properties and will separate. (Peak 2)\n    3.  **Racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These are enantiomers and will co-elute as one peak. (Peak 3)\n    4.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol:** This is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) diols. It will have different properties and will separate from their peak. (Peak 4)\n*   Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral stationary phase can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all compounds that are not identical.\n*   It separates constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n*   Let's count the separable compounds:\n    1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (Peak 1)\n    2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (diastereomer of 1, will separate) (Peak 2)\n    3.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** (Peak 3)\n    4.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (enantiomer of 3, will separate on a chiral column) (Peak 4)\n    5.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol** (diastereomer of 3 and 4, will separate) (Peak 5)\n*   All five stereoisomers are unique and will be resolved by a chiral column.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
