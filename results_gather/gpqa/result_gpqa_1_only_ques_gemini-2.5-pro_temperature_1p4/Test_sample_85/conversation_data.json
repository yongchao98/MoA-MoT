    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions yield a lactone (a cyclic ester) called **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's deconstruct this name:\n*   **Pyran:** A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro:** The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position (the oxygen atom is at position 1).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the C4 position.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product has a chiral center at C4, where the ethyl group is attached. Reaction 1 gives the (R)-isomer, and Reaction 2 gives the (S)-isomer.\n\nThis lactone is a delta-lactone, which is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor would be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. Upon cyclization, the C3 of the acid chain becomes the C4 of the lactone ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options for the starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's draw this structure:\n*   **Pentanoic acid:** A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1).\n*   **3-ethyl:** An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo:** This describes an isobutyl ester group (-COO-isobutyl) at the other end of the chain (C5).\n\nThe structure is:\n(isobutyl)-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COOH\n(C5)         (C4)   (C3)          (C2)    (C1)\n\nThis molecule is a di-functional compound containing:\n*   A **carboxylic acid** group at C1.\n*   An **ester** group at C5.\n*   A **chiral center** at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nTo form the final lactone product, one of the two carbonyl groups (the acid or the ester) in the starting material must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), followed by cyclization. The key to solving this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones. It **does not** typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This is a reducing agent that is highly selective for **carboxylic acids**, reducing them to primary alcohols. It does not typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group (at C5) to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group (at C1) remains unchanged.\n2.  **Intermediate:** This forms (3R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n3.  **Cyclization:** The H⁺ workup causes the -OH group (from C5) to attack the carboxylic acid carbonyl (at C1), forming the (R)-lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To get an (R)-product, the starting material **A** must be the **(R)-isomer**.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group (at C1) to a primary alcohol. The ester group (at C5) remains unchanged.\n2.  **Intermediate:** This forms (3S)-isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Cyclization:** The H⁺ workup causes the newly formed -OH group to attack the ester carbonyl (at C5) in an intramolecular transesterification reaction, forming the (S)-lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the stereochemistry at C3 is retained. To get an (S)-product, the starting material **B** must be the **(S)-isomer**.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
