    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers), provided the molecule does not possess any internal elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) or a center of inversion (i). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)CH2CH3`. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex, bridged bicyclic molecule. The name explicitly gives the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E). This specification of a single stereoisomer of a molecule that lacks any obvious symmetry makes it chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. These stereocenters are equivalent (bonded to the same four types of groups). When a molecule has two equivalent stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making them achiral despite having stereocenters. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two equivalent stereocenters with the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any internal symmetry and is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: In this molecule, the C1 carbon (bearing the -OH group) is a stereocenter. It is attached to four different groups: -OH, -H, and two different carbon paths around the ring (-CH2-CH= and -CH2-CH2-CH=). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single pure enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This nomenclature indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This highly symmetric molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group) and a C3 axis of rotation. Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The systematic name describes the structure `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This is cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone. Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it has two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry in certain conformations. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
