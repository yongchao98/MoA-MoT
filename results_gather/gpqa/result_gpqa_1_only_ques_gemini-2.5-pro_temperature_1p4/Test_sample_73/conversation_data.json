    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Nature of Radioactive Decay**\n    Radioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. A key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed without decaying. The atom doesn't \"age.\"\n\n2.  **Define the Decay Probability**\n    The probability, $P$, that an atom decays within a time interval, $t$, is given by the formula:\n    $P(\\text{decay in time } t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom.\n\n    The probability that the atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time $t$ is:\n    $P(\\text{survive for time } t) = e^{-\\lambda t}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (Î»)**\n    We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    $P(\\text{decay in 100 min}) = 0.32$\n    This also means the probability of *surviving* for 100 minutes is:\n    $P(\\text{survive for 100 min}) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68$\n\n    Using the survival formula:\n    $e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68$\n    We don't need to solve for $\\lambda$ itself; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability**\n    We want to find the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given it has already survived for 50 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, the fact that it survived the first 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay. The question simplifies to: What is the probability a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\n\n    We need to calculate:\n    $P(\\text{decay in 150 min}) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}$\n\n5.  **Solve the Equation**\n    We can rewrite the term $e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}$ using the value we found in step 3:\n    $e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} = (e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100})^{\\frac{150}{100}} = (e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100})^{1.5}$\n\n    Now substitute the known value ($e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68$):\n    $e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} = (0.68)^{1.5}$\n\n    Calculate the value:\n    $(0.68)^{1.5} \\approx 0.5607$\n\n    Now, find the final probability of decay:\n    $P(\\text{decay in 150 min}) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393$\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This rounds to 44%.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
