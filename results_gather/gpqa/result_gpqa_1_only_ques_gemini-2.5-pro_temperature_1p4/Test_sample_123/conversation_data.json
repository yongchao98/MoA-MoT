    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics\n\nThis problem combines the principles of special relativity (specifically time dilation) and radioactive decay.\n\n*   **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles, N, remaining from an initial sample N₀ after a time 't' is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / τ_eff)\n    where τ_eff is the effective mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. Due to time dilation, their internal \"clocks\" run slower compared to the clocks in the lab. This means their observed lifetime in the lab frame (τ_eff) is longer than their proper lifetime (τ, the lifetime in their own rest frame). The relationship is:\n    τ_eff = γ * τ\n    where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Combining the Concepts:** Substituting the time-dilated lifetime into the decay equation, we get the decay law in the lab frame:\n    N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / (γ * τ))\n\n### 2. Setting up the Equations\n\nThe particles are created at the center of the detector and must travel a distance R = 30 meters to reach the inner walls. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is:\nt = distance / speed ≈ R / c\n\nNow we can write the fraction of particles (N/N₀) that survive the journey to the detector wall:\nN/N₀ = e^(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = e^(-R / (cγτ))\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (cτ)`. This constant depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime, which are the same in both scenarios. The equation becomes:\nN/N₀ = e^(-K / γ)\n\n### 3. Using the Given Information (Case 1)\n\nWe are given that when the Lorentz factor γ₁ = 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n*   N/N₀ = 1/3\n*   γ₁ = 20\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n1/3 = e^(-K / 20)\n\nTo solve for K, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -K / 20\n-ln(3) = -K / 20\nK = 20 * ln(3)\n\n### 4. Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (Case 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂, required for two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n*   N/N₀ = 2/3\n*   γ₂ = ?\n\nUsing the same equation with the new values:\n2/3 = e^(-K / γ₂)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\nln(2) - ln(3) = -K / γ₂\n-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -K / γ₂\nln(3/2) = K / γ₂\n\nNow we have two expressions:\n1.  K = 20 * ln(3)\n2.  K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)\n\nBy equating them, we can solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\nγ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value for γ₂ using the standard values for natural logarithms:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\nγ₂ = 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Lorentz factor needed to have about two-thirds of the particles reaching the detector is approximately 54. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
