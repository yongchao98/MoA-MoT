    "To find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$, we use the formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\nwhere $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of an operator $A$ for a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, let's write down the given matrices and the state vector.\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is given by:\n$P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe state of the system is given by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe corresponding bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle\\psi| = (|\\psi\\rangle)^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can check that the state is normalized:\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (-1/2)^2 + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, which is $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$\n\nFirst, we calculate the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, which is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\nFirst, we find the matrix for $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n\nFinally, we calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
