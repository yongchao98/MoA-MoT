    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The **Galaxy's reference frame (S)**: This is considered the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The **ejecta's reference frame (S')**: This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (the proper time) is `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   Find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval `Δt` compared to the time interval `Δt'` measured in the moving frame (ejecta). The formula for time dilation is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Calculating the value: `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`.\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy Frame (d):**\n    *   Now, use the distance formula `d = v * Δt`:\n        `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\nThis value is very close to option C.\n\n**Alternative approach using approximation (which leads to the exact answer choice):**\n\nFor small values of `β²`, the Lorentz factor `γ` can be approximated using the binomial expansion `(1-x)^n ≈ 1-nx`. Here `γ = (1 - β²)⁻¹/²`.\n`γ ≈ 1 + (-1/2)(-β²) = 1 + β²/2`\n`γ ≈ 1 + (0.04)/2 = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02`\n\n*   Now, calculate `Δt` using this approximate `γ`:\n    `Δt ≈ 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s`\n*   Calculate the distance `d`:\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km`\n\nThis result matches option C exactly.\n\n*   **Option D** `(3,000,000 km)` would be the classical (non-relativistic) answer, `d = v * Δt' = 60,000 * 50`.\n*   **Option A** `(2,940,000 km)` results from incorrectly applying the Lorentz factor (multiplying by `sqrt(1-v²/c²)` instead of dividing).\n\nTherefore, the correct relativistic calculation leads to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
