    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The gravitational pull of the planet causes the star to \"wobble,\" moving slightly towards and away from us. This motion shifts the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the star's maximum radial velocity, known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n\nTherefore, we can establish a ratio between the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1$ and $K_2$) of the two stars based on their measured wavelength shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$ and $\\Delta\\lambda_2$):\n\n$K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n**2. Relate RV Semi-Amplitude to Orbital Period**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's mass ($m_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), the orbital period ($P$), and the inclination of the orbit ($i$) by the following formula:\n\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n\nHere, $G$ is the gravitational constant. The term $m_p \\sin i$ is often called the \"minimum mass\" because the inclination $i$ is usually unknown.\n\n**3. Set up a Ratio for the Two Systems**\n\nWe can compare the two star-planet systems by taking the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes:\n\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{(m_p \\sin i)_2}{M_{star,2}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{(m_p \\sin i)_1}{M_{star,1}^{2/3}}}$\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$.\n*   The planets have masses similar to Neptune. In the context of RV detection, this means their minimum masses are the same: $(m_p \\sin i)_1 = (m_p \\sin i)_2$.\n\nBecause these quantities are the same for both systems, they cancel out in the ratio, along with the constant term $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$. The equation simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(1/P_2)^{1/3}}{(1/P_1)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**4. Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital periods, $P_2 / P_1$. We can rearrange the equation from the previous step to solve for this ratio:\n\nFirst, cube both sides:\n$\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\nThen, take the reciprocal of both sides to get the desired ratio:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nNow, we substitute the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes we found in Step 1:\n\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\nCalculating the decimal value gives:\n\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
