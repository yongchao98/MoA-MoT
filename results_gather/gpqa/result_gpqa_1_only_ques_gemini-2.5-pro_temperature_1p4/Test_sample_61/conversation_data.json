    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis problem to identify the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and the Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. Its structure is a cyclohexyl group attached to a terminal alkyne (C≡CH). Let's denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy'. So, the starting material is Cy-C≡CH. It contains 8 carbon atoms (6 in the ring + 2 in the ethynyl group).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break down this name:\n    *   The parent molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexyl ring with a carbaldehyde group (-CHO) attached. Let's say the -CHO group is at position 1.\n    *   At this same position 1, there is a substituent: (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). This group's structure is -CH(OH)-Cy.\n    *   So, the structure has a quaternary carbon on one cyclohexane ring, which is bonded to the rest of its ring, a -CHO group, and a -CH(OH)-Cy group.\n    *   The molecule contains two cyclohexyl rings. The total carbon count is (6+1) + (1+6) = 14 carbons.\n\nSince we start with an 8-carbon molecule and end with a 14-carbon molecule containing two cyclohexyl rings, a dimerization step must be involved. The structure of the final product, an α-hydroxy aldehyde, strongly suggests that it is formed by the dimerization of an aldehyde intermediate. The most plausible intermediate is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO)**.\n\nThe overall strategy should therefore be:\n1.  Synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.\n2.  Dimerize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nWe need to find the sequence that correctly synthesizes cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and then performs a dimerization.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol 2. Li/liq. NH3 3. O3/ (CH3)2S 4. NH4OH**\n    *   Step 1: NaNH2 is a strong base, but methanol (CH3OH) is a protic solvent. NaNH2 reacts with methanol to form sodium methoxide (NaOCH3), a weaker base that cannot effectively deprotonate the alkyne. If NaNH2 is used first and methanol is added later to the acetylide anion, it would just reprotonate it. This step is not synthetically useful for chain extension. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride 2. H2/Pd 3. Ba(OH)2 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   Step 1: Cy-C≡CH reacts with NaNH2 and then CH3Cl to form Cy-C≡C-CH3 (1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne). This is a valid alkylation.\n    *   Step 2: H2/Pd is a strong reducing agent that would reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane: Cy-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propylcyclohexane).\n    *   The subsequent steps (hydration or reaction with base) cannot proceed from an alkane to form the desired product. The sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride 2. Li/liq. NH3 3. O3/ H2O 4. NH4OH**\n    *   Step 1: Alkylation with ethyl chloride gives Cy-C≡C-CH2CH3 (1-cyclohexyl-1-butyne).\n    *   Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 reduces the internal alkyne to a *trans*-alkene: *trans*-Cy-CH=CH-CH2CH3.\n    *   Step 3: Ozonolysis (O3) followed by water (H2O) is an *oxidative* workup. This cleaves the double bond and oxidizes the resulting aldehyde fragments to carboxylic acids. The products would be cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Cy-COOH) and propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH).\n    *   Since the final product is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate 3. O3/ (CH3)2S 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Step 1:** Cy-C≡CH + NaNH2 + CH3Cl → Cy-C≡C-CH3 (1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne). This is a standard alkyne alkylation.\n    *   **Step 2:** H2/Pd-CaCO3 is Lindlar's catalyst, which performs a stereoselective partial hydrogenation of an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. Cy-C≡C-CH3 → *cis*-Cy-CH=CH-CH3.\n    *   **Step 3:** Ozonolysis (O3) followed by dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S) is a *reductive* workup. It cleaves the double bond to form two aldehyde molecules. *cis*-Cy-CH=CH-CH3 → Cy-CHO (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) + CH3CHO (acetaldehyde). This successfully synthesizes the key intermediate.\n    *   **Step 4:** Ba(OH)2 is a base that can catalyze a dimerization of the aldehyde. Although the precise structure of the named product is unusual and the reaction may not be a standard aldol condensation (which would give a β-hydroxy aldehyde), this sequence is the only one that correctly generates the necessary aldehyde precursor (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and includes a plausible, if non-standard, dimerization step. Among the given choices, this is the only chemically logical pathway.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence C provides a valid synthetic route to produce cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The final step involves the dimerization of this aldehyde. While there might be an issue with the exact name of the product or the specific catalyst for the last step in the problem statement, the sequence of transformations presented in C is the only viable option.\n\n<<<C>>>"
