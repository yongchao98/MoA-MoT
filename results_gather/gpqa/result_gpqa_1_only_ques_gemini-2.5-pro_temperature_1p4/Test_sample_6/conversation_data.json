    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray.\n\n### 1. The Physics of the Process\n\nThe process we are considering is pair production from two photons:\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^- $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is a high-energy gamma-ray, $\\gamma_{CMB}$ is a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background, and $e^+$ and $e^-$ are a positron and an electron, respectively.\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two initial photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products (the electron-positron pair). This is the threshold condition.\n\n### 2. Relativistic Kinematics\n\nWe will use four-vector notation. The four-momentum of a particle is $p = (E/c, \\vec{p})$, where $E$ is the energy and $\\vec{p}$ is the three-momentum. For simplicity, we'll use natural units where the speed of light $c=1$. The four-momentum is then $p = (E, \\vec{p})$. The square of a four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial reference frames: $p^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2$.\n\nLet's denote the four-momenta:\n*   High-energy gamma-ray: $p_1 = (E_1, \\vec{p}_1)$\n*   CMB photon: $p_2 = (E_2, \\vec{p}_2)$\n*   Electron: $p_3$\n*   Positron: $p_4$\n\nFor a photon, which is massless, $E = |\\vec{p}|$, so its four-momentum squared is $p^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = 0$.\nFor an electron or positron of rest mass $m_e$, its four-momentum squared is $p^2 = m_e^2$.\n\n### 3. Threshold Condition\n\nThe law of conservation of four-momentum states:\n$$ p_1 + p_2 = p_3 + p_4 $$\n\nSquaring both sides gives the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, which is a Lorentz invariant called the Mandelstam variable $s$:\n$$ s = (p_1 + p_2)^2 = (p_3 + p_4)^2 $$\n\nAt the threshold energy, the final products (electron and positron) are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, their total energy is just the sum of their rest energies, $m_e + m_e = 2m_e$. The total momentum is zero. So, the total four-momentum of the final state is $(2m_e, \\vec{0})$.\nThe invariant mass squared of the final state at threshold is therefore:\n$$ s_{threshold} = (2m_e)^2 = 4m_e^2 $$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the invariant mass squared for the initial state in the lab frame (the frame of the CMB).\n$$ (p_1 + p_2)^2 = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + 2 p_1 \\cdot p_2 $$\nSince both initial particles are photons, $p_1^2 = 0$ and $p_2^2 = 0$. So:\n$$ s = 2 p_1 \\cdot p_2 = 2(E_1 E_2 - \\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2) $$\nSince $|\\vec{p}_1| = E_1$ and $|\\vec{p}_2| = E_2$, we have:\n$$ s = 2 E_1 E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Threshold Energy\n\nTo find the minimum energy $E_1$ for the reaction to occur, we need the most efficient collision. This happens when the center-of-mass energy is maximized for a given $E_1$ and $E_2$. Looking at the expression $s = 2 E_1 E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)$, this occurs when $\\cos\\theta = -1$, which corresponds to a head-on collision ($\\theta = \\pi$ radians or 180Â°).\n\nAt this maximum efficiency:\n$$ s_{max} = 2 E_1 E_2 (1 - (-1)) = 4 E_1 E_2 $$\n\nNow we set this equal to the threshold energy required for the final state:\n$$ s_{max} = s_{threshold} $$\n$$ 4 E_1 E_2 = 4 m_e^2 $$\n$$ E_1 E_2 = m_e^2 $$\n\nThe threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_1$, is therefore:\n$$ E_{1, th} = \\frac{m_e^2}{E_2} $$\n\n### 5. Plugging in the Values\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_2 = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow we can calculate the threshold energy $E_{1, th}$:\n$$ E_{1, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_{1, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_{1, th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$). Let's convert our result:\n$$ E_{1, th} (\\text{GeV}) = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} $$\n$$ E_{1, th} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nThis result is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 2.6*1e5 GeV\nB) 1.8*1e5 GeV\nC) 3.9*1e5 GeV\nD) 9.5*1e4 GeV\n\nOur calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
