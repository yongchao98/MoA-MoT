  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To identify the problem, we must analyze the provided DNA sequence. A protein is synthesized by translating the sequence of codons (three-nucleotide units) starting from a start codon (ATG) until a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) is reached.\n\nThe reading frame is established by the start codon, `ATG`. Let's translate the beginning of the given sequence codon by codon:\n\n1.  `ATG` -> Methionine (Start codon)\n2.  `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n3.  `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n4.  `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n5.  `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n6.  `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n7.  `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n8.  `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n9.  `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n10. `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n\nThe sequence `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` correctly codes for the peptide `YPYDVPDYA`, which is the standard influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. This eliminates option C, as there is no missense mutation in the tag.\n\nNow, let's look at the codons immediately following the tag sequence:\n\n11. `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n12. `TGA` -> **STOP**\n\nThe sequence contains a `TGA` codon, which is one of the three stop codons. This codon is located immediately after the HA tag sequence and a single lysine codon. When the ribosome encounters this stop codon, it will release the nascent polypeptide chain, terminating translation prematurely. The result would be a very short, non-functional peptide (Met-HA-Lys), not the full-length GADD45G fusion protein. This perfectly explains why the researcher is unable to detect the overexpression of the expected protein.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   **B)** The lack of a linker might affect protein folding or stability in some cases, but the primary and definitive issue here is the premature stop codon that prevents the synthesis of the full-length protein in the first place.\n*   **D)** UAA, UAG, and UGA are stop codons because corresponding tRNAs do not exist in the universal genetic code (except for rare exceptions like selenocysteine insertion at UGA codons, which requires a specific downstream sequence not present here). So, the statement is based on a misunderstanding of how stop codons work and misidentifies the problematic codon in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct reason for the failed experiment is the early termination of translation due to a premature stop codon.\n\n<<<A>>>"
