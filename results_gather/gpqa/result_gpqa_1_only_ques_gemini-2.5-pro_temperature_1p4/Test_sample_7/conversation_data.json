  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the relationship between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of G2:**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows a 0% resistance phenotype. This is the most severe effect observed, indicating a complete loss of the resistance trait.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g2` also shows 0% resistance. The phenotype of the double mutant is identical to the `g2` single mutant, not a combination of `g1` and `g2`. This phenomenon is called **epistasis**, where one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. Specifically, G2 is **epistatic** to G1.\n    *   Similarly, the double mutant `g2g3` shows 0% resistance, the same as the `g2` single mutant. Therefore, G2 is also **epistatic** to G3.\n    *   In a genetic pathway, the epistatic gene is often upstream. The fact that knocking out G2 leads to a complete loss of resistance and masks the effects of G1 and G3 strongly suggests that **G2 is an upstream master regulator**, such as the transcription factor mentioned in the problem description. It likely activates both G1 and G3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutants `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance) both show a partial loss of resistance, but neither is as severe as `g2`. This suggests they are downstream of G2 and contribute to the resistance trait in parallel.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` shows only 10% resistance. This phenotype is much more severe than either of the single mutants. When the loss of two genes together has a much stronger effect than the loss of either one alone, it suggests the genes have overlapping or related functions. This relationship can be described as **gene redundancy** (in this case, partial redundancy, since the single mutants do have a phenotype). They likely act in two parallel branches of the resistance pathway, both controlled by G2.\n    *   There is no epistasis between G1 and G3. If G1 were epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). This is not the case. If G3 were epistatic to G1, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would be the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%). This is also not the case.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. G2 is the likely transcription factor, not G1. Also, there is no evidence for pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) as only one trait (resistance) was measured.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: This is strongly supported by the data.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: This is a good description of their relationship.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This is incorrect, as shown in the analysis above.\n        However, this option correctly identifies the main regulator (G2) and the relationship between the other two genes (redundancy). It contains the most accurate conclusions.\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect. There is no evidence for pleiotropy, and G1 is not epistatic to G3.\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. While having the same promoter is a possibility if they are co-regulated by G2, it's an unproven molecular mechanism, not a direct conclusion from this experiment. More importantly, G3 is not epistatic to G1.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option B provides the most accurate description of the genetic interactions, despite having an error in its final clause. The first two statements in option B (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\") are the best conclusions that can be drawn from the experimental data. It is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
