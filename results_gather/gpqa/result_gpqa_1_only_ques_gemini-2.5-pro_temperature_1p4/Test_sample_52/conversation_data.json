    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core of our molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Group (FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains one carbonyl carbon (C=O) and two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two signals for aromatic protons. A di-substituted benzene ring has a total of 4 aromatic protons (C6**H4**). The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution, where the protons appear as two distinct sets. This confirms the C6H4 part of the structure.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are two signals for vinyl protons.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**, which means it's coupled to (adjacent to) only one other proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**, meaning it's coupled to one proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). A group of three equivalent protons is a methyl group (-CH3).\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon next to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton (giving a doublet). The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This substituent adds C3H5 (C-H, C-H, C-H3) to the molecule.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are two signals for -CH3 groups.\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**) we just identified.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must be part of the ester group. An ester is of the form R-COO-R'. The problem states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**. This is a critical clue. It rules out common ester types like ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl esters. Therefore, the R' part of the ester must be a methyl group (-CH3), making it a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)**. This substituent accounts for the ester functionality and adds C2H3O2 (one C=O, one O, and one CH3) to the molecule.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecule and Determine the Formula:**\n    Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified pieces:\n    *   **Benzene ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Substituent 1 (propenyl group):** -CH=CH-CH3 → C3H5\n    *   **Substituent 2 (methyl ester group):** -COOCH3 → C2H3O2\n\n    **Total atoms:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\n    The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D.\n\n    *   A) C12H12O2\n    *   B) C12H14O2\n    *   C) C11H14O2\n    *   D) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
