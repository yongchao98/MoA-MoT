    "The impulse approximation is a fundamental concept in nuclear physics that simplifies the calculation of interactions between a probe (like an electron or neutrino) and a nucleus. The core idea is to treat the interaction as a quick, \"impulsive\" collision with a single nucleon, which behaves as if it were a free particle during that instant. Let's analyze each assumption:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the primary assumption. It posits that the interaction can be described as the sum of interactions with the individual constituent nucleons, rather than with the nucleus as a whole or with multi-nucleon systems (which would involve so-called meson-exchange currents). This is a cornerstone of the impulse approximation.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption means that the incoming probe interacts with only one nucleon and that the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) leave the nucleus without any further interactions with the other (A-1) nucleons. This is also known as neglecting \"final-state interactions\" (FSI). While more advanced models try to correct for FSI, this transparency is a key simplifying assumption in the basic form of the impulse approximation, often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, is about how a nucleon behaves within the *nuclear medium*. It approximates the behavior of a bound nucleon by that of a free nucleon. The model used to describe the *free nucleon's* internal structure (whether its constituent quarks are relativistic or not) is a separate issue. The impulse approximation itself does not depend on the specific model of nucleon structure. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. It assumes the interaction happens over a very short timescale, so fast that the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with the other nucleons or the nuclear potential that binds it. For that brief moment, it acts like a free particle, unconstrained by nuclear binding forces. This is essential to the approximation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
