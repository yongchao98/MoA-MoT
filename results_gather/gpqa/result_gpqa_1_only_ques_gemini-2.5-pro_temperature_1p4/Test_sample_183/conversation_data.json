    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   The ethoxy group and the tert-butyl group are *ortho* to each other.\n*   The tert-butyl group and the nitro group are *ortho* to each other.\n*   The ethoxy group and the nitro group are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. Very bulky, so it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It can be added and removed, making it an excellent blocking group.\n\n**The Synthetic Challenge:**\nThe main challenge is establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with two *ortho, para*-directing groups (-OEt, -tBu) located *ortho* to each other. Direct electrophilic substitution to create this arrangement is very difficult due to steric hindrance and directing effects. For example, nitrating 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene would add the nitro group at positions 4 or 6, not position 3. This indicates that a more complex strategy involving blocking groups or functional group interconversions is required.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration) -> Nitrobenzene\nii) Fe/HCl (Reduction) -> Aniline\niii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation): This reaction is problematic with aniline. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form anilinium (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. This leads to poor yields and incorrect regiochemistry. This option is not viable.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration) -> This gives a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product (>70%), making this a low-yield step for any synthesis requiring the *ortho* isomer.\niv) NaNO2/HCl: This reagent is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The product from step (iii) (a nitro-sulfonic acid) does not have an amino group. This step is chemically incorrect in this position. This option is flawed.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence starts similarly to C by creating a mixture of ortho/para isomers, which is not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. Following the path with the minor *ortho*-isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), subsequent reduction, nitration, diazotization, and other steps lead to 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, which is the wrong isomer.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis sequence employs a more sophisticated strategy using a blocking group. Let's analyze it step-by-step.\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** Sulfonation. The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming -SO3H group almost exclusively to the *para* position. This blocks the para position.\n*   **iii) 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, and the -SO3H group is a *m*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the t-butyl group (C2). This is a powerful strategy to force ortho-substitution.\n*   **iv) 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amino group.\n*   **v) 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → 4-tert-Butyl-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonate:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n*   **vi) ... + HNO3/H2SO4:** This step is unusual. If interpreted as nitration, it would occur on a highly deactivated ring. The most plausible interpretation in the context of creating the target is that a series of transformations begins, using the remaining reagents. Let's assume there is a specific, albeit perhaps non-obvious, sequence of reactions involving the remaining reagents that leads to the target.\n*   **vii) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This reagent cocktail replaces a diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **viii) ... + dilute H2SO4:** This is the standard condition for desulfonation (removal of the -SO3H group).\n*   **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr:** This is the Williamson ether synthesis, which converts a phenol (-OH) into an ether (-OEt).\n\nAlthough the exact sequence and regiochemical outcome of steps vi-viii are complex and may involve non-standard reactions or specific conditions, the overall strategy presented in option A is the most chemically sound. It correctly addresses the main synthetic challenge of achieving the required ortho-substitution by using a blocking group. The other options contain more fundamental and insurmountable flaws (e.g., incorrect reactions, poor yields from the start, nonsensical reagent order). Therefore, by elimination and by recognizing the superior underlying strategy, Option A is the most plausible path.\n\nFinal logic: The blocking group strategy (steps i-iii) is the only presented method that can create the t-butyl group and nitro group ortho to each other in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-ix) are a series of functional group interconversions designed to manipulate this intermediate into the final product. While the specific order might be debatable or involve complex transformations, the foundation of the synthesis in A is far superior to the other options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
