    "This is a classic problem of special relativity, specifically dealing with the concept of **time dilation**. We need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) and compare it to the time that passes on Earth (coordinate time).\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the knowns:**\n    *   Speed of the spacecraft (v) = 0.99999987 * c\n    *   Astronaut's age at departure = 22 years\n    *   Average alien lifespan = 150 years\n    *   Destination = Earth\n    *   Origin = Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)\n\n2.  **Determine the distance:**\n    The distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud is not explicitly given, but it is a known astronomical value. A commonly accepted distance is approximately 159,000 light-years. We'll use this as the proper distance (L₀) in the reference frame of Earth and the LMC.\n\n3.  **Calculate the time for the journey in Earth's reference frame (Δt):**\n    Time = Distance / Speed\n    Δt = 159,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n    Since a light-year is the distance light travels in one year (c * 1 year), the 'c' and 'light-year' units cancel out.\n    Δt ≈ 159,000 years\n    An observer on Earth would measure the journey taking approximately 159,000 years.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the time measured in the stationary frame to the time measured in the moving frame.\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    Given v = 0.99999987*c, then v²/c² = (0.99999987)².\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\n    γ = 1 / √(0.00000026)\n    γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\n    γ ≈ 1961.16\n\n5.  **Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, Δτ):**\n    The time dilation formula is Δt = γ * Δτ. We need to solve for Δτ.\n    Δτ = Δt / γ\n    Δτ ≈ 159,000 years / 1961.16\n    Δτ ≈ 81.07 years\n\n    So, from the astronaut's point of view, the journey takes approximately 81 years.\n\n6.  **Check the astronaut's final age:**\n    The astronaut starts at 22 years old.\n    Final Age = 22 years + 81 years = 103 years.\n    Since the average lifespan is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey. This eliminates option C.\n\nThe calculated journey time for the astronaut is approximately 81 years, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
