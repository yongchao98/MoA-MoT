    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Product from NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the NMR spectra provided for the product of the reaction.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula of X and Product:** The problem states Compound X is C11H12O. Since the reaction conditions (DABCO, heat) suggest an isomerization or rearrangement, the product will also have the molecular formula C11H12O.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C11H12O, the DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 6. This high DBE suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) plus two additional degrees of unsaturation (e.g., a C=C bond and a C=O bond).\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 197.7 (1C, s): This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone as there is no aldehyde proton in the ¹H NMR. This accounts for one DBE and the oxygen atom.\n    *   Signals in the aromatic/vinylic region (120-150 ppm): 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C). The presence of two signals integrating to 2 carbons each (126.9 and 129.1) strongly suggests a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, specifically a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring. This accounts for the benzene ring (4 DBEs).\n    *   Signals in the aliphatic region (< 40 ppm): δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s). These are typical chemical shifts for methyl (CH₃) carbons.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. The large chemical shift difference indicates that the two substituents have different electronic properties (one electron-donating, one electron-withdrawing).\n    *   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. These are two distinct methyl groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n    *   δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 6.75 (1H, d): These are two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton. They are coupled to each other, which is characteristic of two protons on a double bond (-CH=CH-). This accounts for the final DBE.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a ketone (-C=O).\n    2.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    3.  We have two methyl groups (-CH₃). One must be the substituent on the ring (forming a tolyl group) to account for its singlet nature. The other must be attached to the ketone (forming an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH₃) or another part of the molecule without adjacent protons.\n    4.  We have a trans-alkene group (-CH=CH-).\n    5.  Let's combine these pieces to match the formula C11H12O and the spectra. The most plausible structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n        *   Structure: CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n        *   This structure has a p-tolyl group (CH₃-C₆H₄-), which accounts for one methyl singlet (~2.3 ppm) and the 1,4-disubstituted ring pattern.\n        *   It has an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃), accounting for the second methyl singlet (~2.3 ppm) and the ketone carbon.\n        *   It has a -CH=CH- group, consistent with the two 1H doublets. The proton beta to the carbonyl is strongly deshielded by both the carbonyl and the ring, matching the observed shifts.\n        *   The formula C11H12O and DBE=6 are correct for this structure.\n\n**2. Identify Compound X**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X to the product identified above. Therefore, Compound X must be an isomer of 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The options provided are all oxiranes (epoxides), which are known to rearrange to carbonyl compounds under thermal or catalytic conditions.\n\nCompound X must have the same elemental composition as the product. The product contains a **p-tolyl group** (a p-substituted ring with a methyl group). We must find which of the starting material options contains this structural feature.\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Contains a **phenyl group**, not a p-tolyl group. This cannot be Compound X.\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Contains a **styryl group**, which has a phenyl ring, not a p-tolyl group. This cannot be Compound X.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The substituent is a 4-methylstyryl group, which is **p-tolyl-CH=CH-**. This molecule contains the required **p-tolyl group**.\n*   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** This has the formula C₁₀H₁₀O, which is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option C contains the correct aromatic skeleton (the p-tolyl group) required to form the identified product. The rearrangement of a vinyloxirane like 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane to the corresponding α,β-unsaturated ketone is a known transformation.\n\n(Note: There appears to be an inconsistency in the problem statement. The product has two methyl groups, while the named reactant in option C has only one. However, among the given choices, C is the only one that could possibly form a product with a p-tolyl group, making it the only plausible answer.)\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
