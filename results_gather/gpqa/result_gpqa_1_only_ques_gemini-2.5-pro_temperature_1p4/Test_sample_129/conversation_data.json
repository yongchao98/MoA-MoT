    "Here is a step-by-step estimation to find the lower limit on the redshift.\n\n1.  **Identify the key physical constraint:** Ground-based optical telescopes cannot observe wavelengths that are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is largely opaque to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The atmospheric \"cutoff\" wavelength, below which very little light reaches the ground, is approximately 3200-3500 Angstroms (Å). Let's use a conservative estimate where practical observations become feasible, which is around 3500 Å.\n\n2.  **Identify the wavelength of interest:** The absorption line is the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen. Its wavelength in the rest frame of the absorbing cloud is $\\lambda_{\\text{rest}} = 1216$ Å.\n\n3.  **Use the cosmological redshift formula:** The redshift, $z$, relates the rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) to the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) by the formula:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} (1 + z)$\n\n4.  **Set up the calculation for the lower limit:** For the Lyα line to be detectable, its observed wavelength must be longer than the atmospheric cutoff wavelength. Therefore, we are looking for the minimum redshift, $z$, that will shift the 1216 Å line to at least ~3500 Å.\n    \n    Let's set $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$ to our estimated cutoff of 3500 Å and solve for $z$:\n    $3500 \\text{ Å} = 1216 \\text{ Å} (1 + z)$\n\n5.  **Solve for z:**\n    $1 + z = \\frac{3500 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}}$\n    $1 + z \\approx 2.88$\n    $z \\approx 2.88 - 1$\n    $z \\approx 1.88$\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) 1.9\n    B) 3\n    C) 2.4\n    D) 1.2\n\n    Our calculated value of $z \\approx 1.88$ is very close to 1.9.\n\n    Let's check the observed wavelength for each option:\n    *   For z = 1.2: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = 1216 \\times (1 + 1.2) = 2675$ Å. This is deep in the UV and blocked by the atmosphere.\n    *   For z = 1.9: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = 1216 \\times (1 + 1.9) = 3526$ Å. This is in the near-UV/violet part of the spectrum and is observable from the ground.\n    *   For z = 2.4: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = 1216 \\times (1 + 2.4) = 4134$ Å. This is clearly observable.\n    *   For z = 3: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = 1216 \\times (1 + 3) = 4864$ Å. This is clearly observable.\n\n    Since the question asks for the **lower limit**, we want the smallest redshift that makes the object detectable. Among the choices, 1.9 is the lowest redshift for which the Lyman-alpha line is shifted to a wavelength that can pass through the atmosphere and be detected by a ground-based telescope.\n\n<<<A>>>"
