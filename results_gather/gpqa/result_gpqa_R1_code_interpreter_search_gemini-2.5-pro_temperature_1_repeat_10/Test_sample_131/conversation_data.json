    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's understand what the NMR data tells us about the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   **Two signals:** This means there are two chemically non-equivalent types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   **Singlets:** This means that these aromatic protons are not adjacent to any other protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **1:1 ratio:** In a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   **Three signals:** There are three chemically non-equivalent types of aliphatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   **All singlets:** This indicates that these protons are from methyl (CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons they can couple with (e.g., they are attached to the aromatic ring or a quaternary carbon). This rules out ethyl groups which would show a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **2:1:1 ratio:** This describes the relative number of protons for each of the three signals. Since both molecules are C10H14 tetramethylbenzenes, the total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from the first molecule) + 12 (from the second molecule) = 24 protons. A 2:1:1 ratio on 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24 = 12 protons\n        *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24 = 6 protons\n        *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24 = 6 protons\n    *   So, we are looking for a combination that produces three methyl signals with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Spectra of Individual Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The aliphatic region would show a quartet and a triplet, not just singlets. Therefore, this compound can be immediately ruled out.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all in different chemical environments. This would theoretically produce four different singlets. However, due to accidental equivalence (very similar chemical shifts), the spectrum typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixtures (The Options)**\n\nNow let's see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One 2H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-) + two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n*   **Aliphatic:** One 12H singlet + three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This gives a total of four signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives multiplets, not just singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   Assuming their chemical shifts are different, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Since both signals arise from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, the integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **Aliphatic:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet of **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets of **6H** each.\n    *   Assuming the three signals have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-) + two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that perfectly explains the observed NMR data is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
