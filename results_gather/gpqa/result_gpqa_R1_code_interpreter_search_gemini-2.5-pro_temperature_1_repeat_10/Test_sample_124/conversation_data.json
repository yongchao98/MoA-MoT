    "An analysis of the user's question is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the physical system:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., it depends only on the radial distance $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$, and the spring constant is the same in all directions.\n\n2.  **Determine the energy eigenvalues:** The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating variables in either Cartesian or spherical coordinates. In Cartesian coordinates, the Hamiltonian separates into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where $H_i = \\frac{p_i^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q_i^2$ for $i=x, y, z$.\n\n    The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ are non-negative integers.\n\n    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three 1D oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_n = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    We define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the energy of the third excited state:**\n    *   The **ground state** corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is for $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The **first excited state** corresponds to the next energy level, which is for $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The **second excited state** corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the degeneracy of the third excited state:** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have this energy. In this case, it's the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum up to the principal quantum number $n$.\n\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$. We need to find the number of integer solutions to the equation:\n    $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z \\ge 0$.\n\n    We can list them out:\n    *   One quantum number is 3: (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, another is 1: (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1). This gives 1 state.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the general formula for the degeneracy of the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, which is given by:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10 - Incorrect energy expression.\n    B) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3 - Incorrect energy expression.\n    C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$ - Correct energy and degeneracy.\n    D) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$ - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
