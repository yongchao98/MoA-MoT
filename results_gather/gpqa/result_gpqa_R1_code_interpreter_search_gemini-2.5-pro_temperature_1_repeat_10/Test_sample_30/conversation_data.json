    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The combination of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is a powerful electrophile.\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃) on a benzene ring. The methyl group is an ortho-, para-director because it is an activating group that donates electron density to the ring, stabilizing the carbocation intermediate (the sigma complex) when the electrophile attacks at the ortho or para positions.\n*   **Product 1:** The major products are ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the para isomer is typically the major product and is usually the intended substrate for subsequent reactions in multi-step synthesis problems. We will assume **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction. Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in the presence of sulfuric acid is a strong oxidizing agent.\n*   **Reactant:** p-nitrotoluene has a methyl group attached to the benzene ring. This is a benzylic position, which is susceptible to oxidation.\n*   **Product 2:** Strong oxidizing agents like MnO₂/H₂SO₄ or KMnO₄ will oxidize a benzylic methyl group all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Therefore, p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to **p-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid)**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This step is more complex and involves several things happening.\n    *   **Acid-Base reaction:** p-nitrobenzoic acid is an acid, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base. The first and fastest reaction will be the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid to form its conjugate base, sodium p-nitrobenzoate.\n    *   **Enolate formation:** Acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) has acidic α-hydrogens. In the presence of a strong base like NaOH, it can be deprotonated to form the acetone enolate anion (⁻CH₂COCH₃).\n    *   **Nucleophilic Attack:** The p-nitrobenzoate anion has a strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group (-NO₂), which makes the aromatic ring electron-deficient and susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The acetone enolate is a good nucleophile.\n*   **Identifying the Product:**\n    *   A simple nucleophilic attack of one acetone enolate on the ring (a Janovsky reaction) would lead to a Meisenheimer complex. For example, attack at a position ortho to the nitro group would create a chiral center, resulting in a molecule with C₁ symmetry. This is not among the options.\n    *   Let's consider a less common but known reaction for highly activated aromatics. With a strong base and a ketone with two α-carbons like acetone, it is possible to form the dianion of acetone (`⁻CH₂-CO-CH₂⁻`). This dianion can act as a dinucleophile.\n    *   This dianion can attack the electron-deficient p-nitrobenzoate ring. The nitro group strongly activates the positions ortho to it (C3 and C5) for nucleophilic attack. The dianion can attack both positions, forming a new six-membered ring fused to the original benzene ring. This type of product is known as a Zimmerman complex.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The product is a tricyclic anionic complex where a `-CH₂-CO-CH₂-` bridge connects carbons C3 and C5 of the original p-nitrobenzoate ring.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3:**\n\n*   Let's analyze the symmetry of this tricyclic structure.\n*   The molecule is not planar. The original aromatic ring is puckered due to C3 and C5 becoming sp³ hybridized.\n*   However, the molecule possesses a single **plane of symmetry (σ)**. This plane contains the C1-C4 axis of the original ring, including the carboxylate group (-COO⁻) and the nitro group (-NO₂). It also contains the carbonyl group (C=O) of the newly formed ring and bisects the two -CH₂- groups.\n*   There are no other symmetry elements like a center of inversion (i) or any rotation axes (Cₙ where n>1).\n*   A molecule that has only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product (3) is a Zimmerman-type adduct which has a single plane of symmetry. Therefore, its molecular symmetry group is Cₛ. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
