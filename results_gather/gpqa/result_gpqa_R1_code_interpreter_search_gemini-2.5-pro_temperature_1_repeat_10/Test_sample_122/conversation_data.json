    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame. To do this, we must first determine the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, which will be different from the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame due to time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Reference Frames:**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We want to find the distance traveled (`Δx`) in this frame. The time measured in this frame is `Δt`.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time measured in this frame (`Δt'`) is the proper time, given as 50 seconds.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Proper time (time elapsed in the ejecta's frame), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. The Physics: Time Dilation**\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, time for a moving object passes slower relative to a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt'`) is given by:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\nNow we can use the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n`Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\nSo, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (Δx):**\nThe distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame is the ejecta's velocity (in that frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in that frame).\n\n`Δx = v * Δt`\n`Δx = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n`Δx = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nLet's use the code interpreter for a precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor gamma\nbeta_squared = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate time in Galaxy frame\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate distance in Galaxy frame\ndx = v * dt\n\nprint(dx)\n```\n<execute_result>\n3061862.1784789723\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 3,000,000 km\nC) 2,940,000 km\nD) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's design.\n\n*   Option B (`3,000,000 km`) would be the answer if we ignored relativity (`Δx = v * Δt' = 60,000 * 50`).\n*   The relativistic effect (time dilation) causes the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame to be longer, so the distance covered is greater than the non-relativistic calculation. This makes A the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the physical principles:**\nThe problem involves an object (supernova ejecta) moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Therefore, the principles of special relativity must be applied. Specifically, we need to account for time dilation.\n\n**2. Define the frames of reference:**\n*   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n*   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time given (50 seconds) is measured in this frame, making it the proper time (`Δt'`).\n\n**3. List the given values:**\n*   Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Proper time (time elapsed in the ejecta's frame), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor accounts for relativistic effects and is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n*   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, squared:\n    `(v/c)² = (60,000 / 300,000)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n*   Now, calculate gamma:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**5. Calculate Time Dilation:**\nTime passes differently in the two reference frames. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the formula `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n\n*   `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:**\nThe distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame is its velocity multiplied by the time elapsed *in the Galaxy's frame*.\n\n*   `Distance = v * Δt`\n*   `Distance = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n*   `Distance = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n*   `Distance = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n**7. Compute the Final Value:**\nUsing the code execution from the previous step:\n`Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**8. Compare with the options:**\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 3,000,000 km\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to `3,060,000 km`. Option A is the correct answer.\n\n(Note: Option B, 3,000,000 km, is the non-relativistic answer obtained by simply multiplying velocity by the proper time: `60,000 km/s * 50 s`. The relativistic effect of time dilation means more time passes in the Galaxy frame, so the ejecta travels a longer distance.)\n\n<<<A>>>"
