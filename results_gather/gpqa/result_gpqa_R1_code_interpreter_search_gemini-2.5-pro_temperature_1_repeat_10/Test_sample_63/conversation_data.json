    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental results to identify the products of decomposition.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H2O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced by the reaction.\n    *   Molar mass of H2O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases, most commonly CO2. Since its weight did not change, no CO2 was formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O2) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O2 ≈ 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** The volume of the remaining gas is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C is what remains after passing through a water absorber, an acid gas absorber, and an oxygen absorber. Given that the original substances are salts (likely containing nitrogen), the most probable identity for this unreactive gas is nitrogen (N2).\n\n**2. Verify the composition using the law of conservation of mass.**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of the identified products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N2 = moles × molar mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), which confirms our identification and calculation of the products are correct.\n\n**3. Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the products must have come from the original salts A and B.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 2 (in H2O) × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** 1 (in H2O) × 0.20 mol + 2 (in O2) × 0.025 mol = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** 2 (in N2) × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol N.\n\nSo, the 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.25 mol of O, and 0.20 mol of N. The molar ratio is H:O:N = 0.40:0.25:0.20, which simplifies to H:O:N = 8:5:4. The combined empirical formula of the mixture is N4H8O5.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nWe are looking for two salts, A and B, in an equimolar mixture, whose combined formula is N4H8O5. The elements present (N, H, O) strongly suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n*   Let's consider ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3).\n*   Formula of NH4NO2 is N2H4O2.\n*   Formula of NH4NO3 is N2H4O3.\n*   If we have one molecule of each, the combined formula is (N2H4O2) + (N2H4O3) = **N4H8O5**. This is a perfect match.\n*   Therefore, Salt A is NH4NO2 and Salt B is NH4NO3.\n\n**5. Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH4NO2):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH4NO3):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
