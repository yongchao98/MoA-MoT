    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Model and Energy Levels**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). The energy levels of such a molecule are given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   E(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational\n*   E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J + 1)\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I).\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n**2. Identify the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: v = 0 and J = 0.\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (0 + 1/2)ħω + B * 0 * (0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State:** The question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This can be interpreted in a few ways, so we must consider the selection rules for photon absorption.\n    *   Vibrational selection rule: Δv = +1 (for absorption).\n    *   Rotational selection rule: ΔJ = ±1.\n\n    Starting from the initial state (v=0, J=0), the allowed transitions are:\n    1.  **Purely Rotational Transition:** Δv = 0, ΔJ = +1. This is forbidden by the vibrational selection rule. However, in reality, pure rotational transitions are possible and represent the lowest energy excitations. Let's calculate the energy for this hypothetical transition to (v=0, J=1):\n        *   ΔE_rot = E(0, 1) - E(0, 0) = [(1/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = 2B.\n    2.  **Rovibrational Transition (R-branch):** Δv = +1, ΔJ = +1. The final state is (v=1, J=1).\n        *   E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B * 1 * (1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B.\n        *   ΔE_rovib = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0) = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B.\n    3.  **Rovibrational Transition (P-branch):** Δv = +1, ΔJ = -1. This is not possible from J=0, as it would lead to J=-1, which is not a valid quantum number.\n\n    Typically, the vibrational energy gap (ħω) is much larger than the rotational energy gap (2B). Therefore, the rovibrational transition (to v=1, J=1) requires significantly more energy than a pure rotational transition (to v=0, J=1). However, looking at the options, the resulting momentum values are relatively large, suggesting a high-energy transition. This implies we should consider the rovibrational transition, which is the lowest energy transition that changes the vibrational state. The phrasing \"next state\" likely refers to the next vibrational manifold.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)**\n\nWe will calculate the energy for the rovibrational transition: ΔE = ħω + 2B.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Calculate Reduced Mass (μ)**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    In kilograms: μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Calculate Moment of Inertia (I)**\n    I = μR²\n    I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Calculate Rotational Constant (B)**\n    B = ħ² / (2I)\n    B ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    B ≈ 4.60 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Calculate Total Transition Energy (ΔE)**\n    ΔE = ħω + 2B\n    ΔE ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) + 2 * (4.60 x 10⁻²³ J)\n    ΔE ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.20 x 10⁻²³ J)\n    ΔE ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    (Note: The rotational energy contribution is about 0.2% of the vibrational energy, so it's very small but should be included for accuracy).\n\n**4. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)**\n\nThe energy of a photon (E) is related to its momentum (p) and the speed of light (c) by the equation E = pc.\n\n*   p = ΔE / c\n*   p ≈ (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s (or N·s)\n\nThis value is very close to option B. Let's perform the calculation with a script for higher precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = 299792458     # Speed of light in m/s\namu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27 # Conversion factor from amu to kg\n\n# Given parameters\nMx_amu = 20.0\nMy_amu = 2.0\nR = 2.0e-10    # in m\nw = 4.0e14     # in rad/s\n\n# Calculations\n# Reduced mass\nmu = (Mx_amu * My_amu) / (Mx_amu + My_amu) * amu_to_kg\n# Moment of inertia\nI = mu * R**2\n# Rotational constant\nB = hbar**2 / (2 * I)\n# Transition energy (from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=1)\ndelta_E = hbar * w + 2 * B\n# Photon momentum\np = delta_E / c\n\nprint(f\"{p:.3e}\")\n```\n\nExecution of the code gives the following result:\n```\n1.410e-28\n```\n\nThe calculated momentum is 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The final calculated value for the momentum is approximately 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s. This value corresponds to option B.\n\nThe step-by-step process was as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Model and States**: The system is a non-rigid rotor. The initial state is the ground state (v=0, J=0). The final state is the lowest possible excited state reachable by absorbing a photon, which, according to selection rules (Δv=+1, ΔJ=+1), is the state (v=1, J=1).\n2.  **Calculate Transition Energy (ΔE)**: The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   ΔE = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0)\n    *   Using the energy formula E(v,J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J(J+1), this becomes:\n    *   ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω + 0 ] = ħω + 2B.\n3.  **Calculate Physical Constants**:\n    *   The reduced mass (μ) was calculated from the given atomic masses.\n    *   The moment of inertia (I) was calculated using the reduced mass and the bond length (I = μR²).\n    *   The rotational constant (B) was calculated from the moment of inertia (B = ħ² / (2I)).\n4.  **Compute Photon Momentum (p)**: The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by ΔE = pc. Therefore, the momentum is p = ΔE / c.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The Python script accurately computed all the intermediate values and the final momentum:\n    *   ΔE = ħω + 2B ≈ (1.054e-34 * 4e14) + 2 * (4.62e-23) ≈ 4.216e-20 J + 9.24e-23 J ≈ 4.225e-20 J.\n    *   p = ΔE / c ≈ 4.225e-20 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 1.408e-28 kg·m/s.\n    The precise output from the code was 1.410e-28 N·s.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
