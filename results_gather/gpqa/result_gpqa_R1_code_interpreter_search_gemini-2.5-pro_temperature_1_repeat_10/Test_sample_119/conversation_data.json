    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   Let `ρ` be the number density of stars. The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed, so `ρ` is a constant value (number of stars per unit volume).\n    *   Let `d` be the distance from the observer to a star.\n    *   Let `plx` be the parallax of the star. Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance: `plx = 1/d`, which means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of stars in a thin shell:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `d` from the observer, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars, `dN`, within this thin shell is the number density `ρ` multiplied by the volume of the shell `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    *   Our goal is to find the relationship with parallax (`plx`), so we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate the expression `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   When we consider the number of stars in a small range (a shell), we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can ignore the negative sign. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. So, we use `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n4.  **Substitute and simplify:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is mathematically represented as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We can find this by dividing our equation for `dN` by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse of the parallax to the fourth power.\n\n<<<A>>>"
