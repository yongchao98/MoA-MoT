    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). Another source of chirality is axial chirality, which arises from restricted rotation around a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (a phenomenon known as atropisomerism). A molecule is achiral (not chiral) if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. The positions ortho to this bond (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: nitro groups (-NO2) and methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The large size of these ortho substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation and its mirror image are non-superimposable. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This is a classic example of atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. There are no chiral centers. The molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
