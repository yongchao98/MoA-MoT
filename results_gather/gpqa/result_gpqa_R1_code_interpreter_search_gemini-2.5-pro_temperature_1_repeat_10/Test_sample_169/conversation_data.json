    "An electron is in a quantum state described by a spinor, which can be represented as a two-component column vector. The spin operator `S_y` acts on this state. The expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n\n`⟨A⟩ = (⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nwhere `⟨ψ|` is the bra vector (the conjugate transpose of the ket vector `|ψ⟩`), and `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the state with itself, which serves as a normalization factor.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Define the state vector and its conjugate transpose.**\n\nThe given spin state is `|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]ᵀ`.\nWe can write this as a column vector:\n`|ψ⟩ =`\n`[3i]`\n`[ 4]`\n\nThe corresponding bra vector `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`. To find the conjugate, we take the complex conjugate of each element. The transpose of a column vector is a row vector.\n`⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n**2. Define the spin operator `S_y`.**\n\nThe spin operator along the y-direction is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix.\nThe problem provides `σ_y`:\n`σ_y =`\n`[0  -i]`\n`[i   0]`\n\nSo, the `S_y` operator is:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) *`\n`[0  -i]`\n`[i   0]`\n\n**3. Calculate the numerator: `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩`**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the action of the operator `S_y` on the state `|ψ⟩`:\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) *`\n`[0  -i]`\n`[i   0]`\n`*`\n`[3i]`\n`[ 4]`\n\nPerforming the matrix-vector multiplication:\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) *`\n`[(0 * 3i) + (-i * 4)]`\n`[(i * 3i) + (0 * 4) ]`\n\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) *`\n`[-4i ]`\n`[3i²]`\n\nSince `i² = -1`:\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) *`\n`[-4i]`\n`[-3 ]`\n\nNow, we pre-multiply by the bra `⟨ψ|`:\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) *`\n`[-4i]`\n`[-3 ]`\n\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i * -4i) + (4 * -3)]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-24]`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = -12ħ`\n\n**4. Calculate the denominator: `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**\n\nThis is the normalization factor, calculated as the inner product of the state with itself.\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] *`\n`[3i]`\n`[ 4]`\n\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i * 3i) + (4 * 4)`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9i² + 16`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9(-1) + 16`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 9 + 16`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25`\n\n**5. Calculate the expectation value `⟨S_y⟩`.**\n\n`⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n`⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
