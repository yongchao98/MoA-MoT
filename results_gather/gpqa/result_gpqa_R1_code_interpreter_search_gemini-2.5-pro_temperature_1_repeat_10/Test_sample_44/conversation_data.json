    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Fermions and the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin projection (`m_s`, which can be spin-up ↑ or spin-down ↓). This means for any given energy level `n`, we can place at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are quantized and given by the formula:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²). So, we can express the single-particle energy levels as:\n    E_n = n² * E\n\nThis means:\n*   E₁ = 1² * E = 1E\n*   E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n    and so on.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contribution = 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 4E):** We have two particles left. We place them in the next available level, n=2.\n    *   Energy contribution = 2 * E₂ = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n### 3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy after the ground state. We can find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level of the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New Configuration:**\n    *   Two particles in n=1 (Energy: 2 * E₁ = 2E)\n    *   One particle in n=2 (Energy: 1 * E₂ = 4E)\n    *   One particle in n=3 (Energy: 1 * E₃ = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state that would result in an energy higher than the first excited state.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3)\n\nLet's consider other possible single-particle promotions from the ground state:\n\n*   **Possibility A: Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   This is an excitation across a larger energy gap.\n    *   Initial configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2.\n    *   New configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Initial configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2.\n    *   New configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nWe can also consider promoting two particles, for instance, both from n=2 to n=3.\n*   **Possibility C: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   New configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states we've found: 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E.\nThe lowest energy is the ground state (10E).\nThe next lowest is the first excited state (15E).\nThe next lowest after that is the second excited state, which is 18E.\n\n### Summary of Results\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
