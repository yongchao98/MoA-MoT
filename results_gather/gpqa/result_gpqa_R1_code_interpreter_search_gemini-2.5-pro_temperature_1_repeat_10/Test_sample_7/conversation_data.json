As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2.**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows a 0% resistance level. This is a complete loss of the trait, indicating that the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for resistance.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g2` also shows 0% resistance. The phenotype of the double mutant is identical to that of the `g2` single mutant. This is the definition of epistasis, where the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation. Therefore, G2 is epistatic to G1.\n    *   Similarly, the double mutant `g2g3` shows 0% resistance, the same as the `g2` single mutant. This means G2 is also epistatic to G3.\n    *   When one gene is epistatic to others, it usually means it acts upstream in the same genetic pathway. Since we are told that one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream, the evidence strongly points to **G2 being the transcription factor** that regulates the expression of G1 and G3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the interaction between Gene G1 and Gene G3.**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has 75% resistance, meaning it's responsible for 25% of the total resistance (100% - 75%).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has 50% resistance, meaning it's responsible for 50% of the total resistance (100% - 50%).\n    *   If the genes acted independently and additively, we would expect the double mutant `g1g3` to have a resistance of 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n    *   However, the observed resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant is 10%. The loss of resistance (90%) is greater than the sum of the individual losses (25% + 50% = 75%). This phenomenon is called a **synergistic interaction**. It suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance through pathways that are partially overlapping or have a compensatory relationship. The term **gene redundancy** (or partial redundancy) is often used to describe this situation, where two genes perform similar or related functions, and the loss of both has a much more severe effect than the loss of either one alone.\n    *   Let's check for epistasis between G1 and G3. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%) or the `g3` phenotype (50%). Therefore, neither G1 is epistatic to G3, nor is G3 epistatic to G1.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the given options based on the analysis.**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a speculation about the molecular mechanism; it cannot be concluded from this phenotypic experiment.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. The synergistic effect observed in the `g1g3` mutant is a hallmark of gene redundancy.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. As established, the phenotype of `g1g3` (10%) is not the same as `g1` (75%).\n\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. The evidence points to G2.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Incorrect. Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (resistance), so we have no evidence for pleiotropy.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Select the best possible answer.**\n    All options contain at least one incorrect or unsupported statement. This is common in complex biology questions where terms can be used loosely or there might be an error in the question design. We must choose the option that is the \"most correct\" or the \"best fit\".\n\n    *   Option B correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor.\n    *   Option B uses \"gene redundancy\" to describe the relationship between G1 and G3, which is the most accurate biological interpretation of the observed synergistic effect.\n    *   The final clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is factually incorrect based on the data. However, the first two clauses of option B are the most accurate conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment compared to the other options. Options A and D make speculative (\"same promoter\") or unsupported (\"pleiotropy\") claims. Therefore, Option B is the best choice among the given possibilities, despite the error in its final part.\n\n<<<B>>>"
