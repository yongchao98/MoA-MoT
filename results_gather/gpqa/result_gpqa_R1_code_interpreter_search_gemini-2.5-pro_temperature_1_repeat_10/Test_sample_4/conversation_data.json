    "An eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator is a non-zero vector that changes by only a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. The corresponding scalar factor is the eigenvalue. We are asked to find the eigenvector of a spin operator for a muon along a direction in the x-z plane, for the eigenvalue of $+\\hbar/2$.\n\n### 1. Define the Operator and the Direction Vector\n\nFirst, let's write down the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$. They are given in terms of the Pauli matrices, $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$:\n$P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n$P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n$P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\nThis operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted by $\\vec{S}$.\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle with the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle with the x-axis in the x-y plane).\nFor the vector to lie in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. For an arbitrary direction (not just along the z-axis where $\\sin\\theta=0$), we must have $\\sin\\phi = 0$, which implies $\\phi = 0$.\nSo, the unit vector for the direction $\\vec{n}$ is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n### 2. Construct the Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$\n\nThe operator for the spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_n$, is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$\nNow, substitute the matrix forms:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 3. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\nLet the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\nWe can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express $b$ in terms of $a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\nUsing the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n$1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n$\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\nSo, the ratio becomes:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\nThis means $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### 4. Normalize the Eigenvector\n\nThe eigenvector must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components is 1:\n$|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$\n$|a|^2 + |a \\tan(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n$|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n$|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n$|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\nTaking the square root and choosing the simplest phase (real and positive), we get:\n$a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$\nNow we find $b$:\n$b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect, eigenvector components are dimensionless and their squares should sum to 1.\nB) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - This matches our derived result.\nC) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect units.\nD) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect dependence on $\\theta$.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
