    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem `a` will become a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides `N` approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\n1.  **Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture in the far-field (Fraunhofer regime) is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n2.  **Intensity Distribution and Minima:**\n    The intensity `I` at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n    where:\n    *   `I₀` is the intensity at the center (θ=0).\n    *   `J₁` is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind.\n    *   `k` is the wavenumber, `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n\n    The minima (dark rings) occur where the intensity is zero. This happens when the numerator is zero, provided the denominator is not zero. Thus, the condition for minima is:\n    `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`\n\n3.  **Locating the Minima:**\n    The minima correspond to the angles `θ` for which the argument of the Bessel function, `x = k * a * sin(θ)`, is a zero of `J₁(x)`. Let the positive zeros of `J₁(x)` be `x₁, x₂, x₃, ...`.\n\n    *   The first minimum (`θ₁`) corresponds to the first zero (`x₁`):\n        `k * a * sin(θ₁) = x₁`\n    *   The second minimum (`θ₂`) corresponds to the second zero (`x₂`):\n        `k * a * sin(θ₂) = x₂`\n\n4.  **Applying the Small Angle Approximation:**\n    The problem states we can use the small angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    *   For the first minimum: `(2π / λ) * a * θ₁ = x₁`  =>  `θ₁ = (x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    *   For the second minimum: `(2π / λ) * a * θ₂ = x₂`  =>  `θ₂ = (x₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Angular Distance:**\n    The angular distance between the first two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = [(x₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)] - [(x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)]`\n    `Δθ = [(x₂ - x₁) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    We need the values of the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. These are well-known values:\n    *   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the coefficient `(x₂ - x₁) / (2π)`. We can use a python script for a precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# Get the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1(x)\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nx1 = zeros[0]\nx2 = zeros[1]\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is given by:\n# delta_theta = [ (x2 - x1) / (2 * pi) ] * (lambda / a)\n# We calculate the coefficient in the square brackets.\ncoefficient = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"The first zero of J1(x) is x1 = {x1}\")\nprint(f\"The second zero of J1(x) is x2 = {x2}\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient for the angular distance is: {coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nThe first zero of J1(x) is x1 = 3.8317059702075123\nThe second zero of J1(x) is x2 = 7.015586669815612\nThe coefficient for the angular distance is: 0.507\n```\n\nThe calculation shows that the coefficient is approximately 0.507.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of 0.507 λ/a is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` approaches a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides `N` tends to infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe far-field diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity distribution as a function of the angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the central intensity.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k` is the wavenumber, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`. Let `u = k * a * sin(θ)`. The minima correspond to the angles `θ` for which `u` is a non-zero root of the Bessel function `J₁(u)`.\n\nLet `u₁` and `u₂` be the first and second positive roots of `J₁(u) = 0`.\n*   The first minimum `θ₁` occurs when `k * a * sin(θ₁) = u₁`.\n*   The second minimum `θ₂` occurs when `k * a * sin(θ₂) = u₂`.\n\nUsing the small angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`:\n*   `k * a * θ₁ = u₁`  => `(2π / λ) * a * θ₁ = u₁` => `θ₁ = (u₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n*   `k * a * θ₂ = u₂`  => `(2π / λ) * a * θ₂ = u₂` => `θ₂ = (u₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between these two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(u₂ - u₁) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n\nThe values of the first two positive zeros of `J₁(u)` are approximately:\n*   `u₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `u₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we calculate the coefficient `(u₂ - u₁) / (2π)`:\n`Coefficient = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) = 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...) ≈ 0.5067`\n\nThe python code output also confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of 0.507.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this with the given options, the closest value is 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<A>>>"
