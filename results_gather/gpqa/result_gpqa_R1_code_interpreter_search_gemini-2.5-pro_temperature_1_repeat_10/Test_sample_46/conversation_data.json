    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is:\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nWhere C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, N = number of nitrogens.\n\nFor C9H11NO2:\nDBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. An amide C=O would typically be at a lower frequency (e.g., 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a carbonyl group, most likely from a conjugated ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (n+1=3, so n=2), i.e., a -CH₂- group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (n+1=4, so n=3), i.e., a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift of the -CH₂- group to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom, forming an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH₂ groups. Combined with the IR data, this signal is definitively assigned to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This region is for aromatic protons. The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The aromatic ring has two different substituents. One must be electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield) and one must be electron-withdrawing (shifting ortho protons downfield). The -NH₂ group is a strong electron-donating group, and the ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n        *   The doublet at 7.0 ppm (more upfield) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the donating -NH₂ group.\n        *   The doublet at 8.0 ppm (more downfield) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this against the options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be attached to a carbonyl, giving a -CH₂- signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different (e.g., one N-H band, formyl proton signal).\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the given data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
