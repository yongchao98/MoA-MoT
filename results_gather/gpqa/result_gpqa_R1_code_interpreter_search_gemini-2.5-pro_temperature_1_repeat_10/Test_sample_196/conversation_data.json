    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption between **3400–2500 cm-1** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm-1** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at **1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet for one proton, appearing far downfield. This is the classic chemical shift for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons meta to it.\n        *   Now let's determine the structure of the other substituent on the ring from the remaining signals:\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. This must be the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and the methine group (at 2.9 ppm).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This must be the methine group (-CH-). It's attached to the aromatic ring (making it a benzylic proton), the methyl group (at 1.4 ppm), and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:**\n            The pieces are: -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3). This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n            ```\n                CH3\n                 |\n            -CH-CH2-CH3\n            ```\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   The reaction is with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a powerful reducing agent combination.\n    *   Red P and HI are known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3). The aromatic ring and the alkyl (sec-butyl) side chain are unaffected by these conditions.\n    *   **Reaction:**\n        4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid ---[Red P, HI]--> 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the final product from the given options.**\n\n    *   The calculated product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   Let's compare this with the options:\n        *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n        *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted product.\n        *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: The alkyl group is isobutyl, not sec-butyl.\n        *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is structurally incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
