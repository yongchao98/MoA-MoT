    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane is a rigid cage-like molecule. The bromines are at bridgehead positions.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH, heated to 240°C. These are harsh basic conditions.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Elimination reactions (like E2) are disfavored at bridgehead carbons due to Bredt's rule. The reaction likely proceeds through a carbocation intermediate (SN1/E1 type) followed by rearrangement, a common pathway for adamantane derivatives.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR spectrum:** A characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. This strongly indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) group, likely in a six-membered ring or a similarly unstrained environment.\n    *   **¹H NMR spectrum:** 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration (2+10+2=14H) matches the number of protons in the starting material. The formula of the product must be C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is unusually deshielded for a simple ketone, suggesting a complex structure.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with aqueous base is a known transformation that proceeds via a cage rearrangement to form a ketone. The product is **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). While the provided NMR data is atypical for this compound (literature spectra do not show a signal near 4.79 ppm), this reaction pathway is the most chemically sound. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one and that the provided spectral data is either erroneous or recorded under very specific conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one, a ketone).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide, heated.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. However, heating the resulting alcohol with an aluminum alkoxide catalyst can also cause dehydration to form an alkene. Since the next step is ozonolysis (which reacts with alkenes), it is logical to conclude that both reduction and dehydration occur.\n    1.  **Reduction:** Protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol.\n    2.  **Dehydration:** The alcohol is dehydrated to form an alkene. The double bond will form between C4 and an adjacent carbon (C3 or C5). A double bond to C3 would involve a bridgehead and violate Bredt's rule. Therefore, the double bond forms between C4 and C5.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** Product 2 is the alkene **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3 and Analyze its NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ozone (O₃) at -78°C, 2. Dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. This process cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The C4=C5 double bond in protoadamant-4-ene is cleaved.\n    *   This opens one of the rings of the tricyclic system, resulting in a bicyclic molecule.\n    *   The original C4 and C5 atoms, which were both CH groups, are converted to aldehyde (CHO) groups.\n    *   The resulting skeleton is that of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. The aldehyde groups are attached at positions 3 and 7.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**. This molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry, meaning the two halves of the molecule, including the two aldehyde groups, are chemically equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen Atom**\n\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons (R-CHO), which typically have a chemical shift (δ) of 9-10 ppm. Protons on the alkane skeleton will be at a much lower chemical shift (1-3 ppm). The question specifies excluding protons that exchange with deuterated solvent (like OH), which doesn't apply here. Thus, we must analyze the coupling pattern of the aldehyde proton.\n*   **Analyze the Coupling:**\n    1.  Let's consider one of the equivalent aldehyde protons (e.g., the one attached to C3).\n    2.  **³J Coupling (Three-bond coupling):** The aldehyde proton will couple with the proton on the adjacent carbon, C3. Since C3 is a methine (CH) group, there is only one proton (H3) on it. This coupling will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    3.  **⁴J Coupling (Four-bond coupling):** The aldehyde proton can also exhibit long-range coupling to other nearby protons. The next closest protons are the two on C2 (H2a, H2b) and the two on C4 (H4a, H4b). Such couplings are often smaller than ³J couplings but can cause further splitting.\n*   **Interpret the Options:** The options are A) doublet of triplets, B) pentet, C) triplet of triplets, D) triplet. A simple doublet is not an option. This implies that we must consider the long-range coupling.\n    *   A **doublet of triplets** would arise if the aldehyde proton couples to one proton (giving the doublet) and then to two other equivalent protons (giving the triplet).\n*   **Putting it all together:** The primary splitting of the aldehyde proton signal is a **doublet** due to the single H3 proton. For the signal to be a **doublet of triplets**, this doublet must be further split into a triplet by two magnetically equivalent protons via long-range coupling. This would most likely be one of the adjacent methylene groups (e.g., C2H₂). While the two protons on C2 (H2a and H2b) are diastereotopic and not strictly equivalent, in introductory and intermediate problems, it is a common simplification to assume they couple equally (J(H_ald, H2a) ≈ J(H_ald, H2b)), thus producing a triplet. The coupling to the other methylene group (C4H₂) is assumed to be negligible.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible description of the signal among the given choices, following the standard logic for such problems, is a doublet (from H3) of triplets (from the C2 protons).\n\n<<<A>>>"
