    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The governing principle for this situation is the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states. Let `N_a` be the number of atoms in a lower energy state `a` (e.g., the ground state) and `N_b` be the number of atoms in a higher energy state `b` (the excited state). The ratio is:\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n    Where:\n    *   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `E_b - E_a = ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:**\n    *   For star_1 with temperature T_1, the excitation ratio is:\n        (N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2 with temperature T_2, the excitation ratio is:\n        (N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This translates to the mathematical relationship:\n    (N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann equations into the relationship:**\n    (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, (g_b / g_a), is a property of the specific iron transition and is the same for both stars, so it cancels out from both sides.\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To solve for T_1 and T_2, we can use logarithms. First, isolate the factor of 2:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n    Using the property of exponents `e^x / e^y = e^(x-y)`:\n    exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\n    exp[ (ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] = 2\n\n8.  **Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n    ln( exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] ) = ln(2)\n    (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Use the numerical values provided:** The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant is a fundamental physical constant with the value `k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`. The problem is clearly designed so that the ratio `ΔE / k` simplifies.\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K.\n    The term `ΔE/k` has units of Kelvin.\n\n10. **Substitute this value back into the equation:**\n    (1 K) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n11. **Perform algebraic manipulation:** Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis by finding a common denominator (T_1 * T_2):\n    (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n12. **Analyze the options:** The options are given as purely mathematical equations without any constants like \"(1 K)\".\n    A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    B) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n    C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n\n    Our derived equation is `(1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`. This doesn't seem to match option C perfectly because of the \"(1 K)\" factor and the resulting dimensional inconsistency if it were omitted (ln(2) is dimensionless, while (T1-T2)/(T1*T2) has units of 1/Temperature).\n\n    However, in physics problems, it is common practice to normalize variables, making them dimensionless. If we define a dimensionless temperature `T' = T / (1 K)`, our equation becomes:\n    [ (T'_1 * 1K - T'_2 * 1K) / (T'_1 * 1K * T'_2 * 1K) ] * 1K = ln(2)\n    [ (T'_1 - T'_2) / (T'_1 * T'_2) ] * (1K * 1K / 1K^2) = ln(2)\n    [ (T'_1 - T'_2) / (T'_1 * T'_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n    This equation, for the dimensionless temperatures `T'`, perfectly matches the form of option C. Given that `ΔE/k` is conveniently equal to 1 K, it is clear that the question intends for this simplification, and the variables `T_1` and `T_2` in the options should be understood as the numerical values of the temperature in Kelvin (which is equivalent to the dimensionless `T'`).\n\n    Therefore, the correct relationship is represented by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
