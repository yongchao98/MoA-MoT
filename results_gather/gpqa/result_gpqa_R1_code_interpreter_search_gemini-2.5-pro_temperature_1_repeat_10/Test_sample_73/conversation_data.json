    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Model of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. The key properties are:\n*   The probability that a single atom survives (does not decay) until time *t* is given by the survival function: P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n*   The probability that an atom decays *within* a time *t* is 1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).\n*   A crucial feature of exponential decay is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The atom does not \"age\".\n\n**2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find the decay constant λ.\n\n*   P(decay in 100 mins) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n*   Subtracting 1 from both sides: -e^(-100λ) = -0.68\n*   This gives us: e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nWe don't need to calculate the exact value of λ yet. This relationship is sufficient for the next steps.\n\n**3. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, the fact that it has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The problem simplifies to finding the probability that a *new* atom of the same type would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n**4. Calculate the Required Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes, which is:\n*   P(decay in 150 mins) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nNow, we use the relationship we found in Step 2: e^(-100λ) = 0.68.\nWe can rewrite e^(-150λ) using this known value:\n*   e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n*   Substituting the value: e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We want to calculate the value of 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n# This represents the probability of decay in 150 minutes.\nprobability = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"The calculated probability is: {probability * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe code calculates the value of 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.440, which is 44.0%.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 40%\nB) 44%\nC) 52%\nD) 48%\n\nThe calculated probability of 44% matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem is about the probability of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The atom does not \"get older\" or \"weaker\".\n\nTherefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. The question is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay in the next 150 minutes?\"\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Define the decay probability function.**\nThe probability P(t) that an atom decays within a time interval *t* is given by:\nP(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\nwhere λ is the decay constant. The term e^(-λt) represents the probability that the atom *survives* past time *t*.\n\n**2. Use the given information to find a value related to λ.**\nWe are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can determine the survival probability for 100 minutes:\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n**3. Calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes.**\nWe need to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. As established by the memoryless property, this is simply P(150).\nP(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can rewrite the exponent using the value we found in step 2:\ne^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value of e^(-100λ):\ne^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nFinally, calculate the decay probability P(150):\nP(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\nP(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\nThis probability, 0.4393, is approximately 43.93%.\n\n**4. Compare with the options.**\nThe calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\nA) 40%\nB) 44%\nC) 52%\nD) 48%\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
