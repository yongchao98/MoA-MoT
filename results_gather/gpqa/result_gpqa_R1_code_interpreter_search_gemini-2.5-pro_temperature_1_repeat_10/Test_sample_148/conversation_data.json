    "*   **Analyze the NMR Data:** The key observation is that a single proton (an alpha-proton) gives rise to two distinct peaks. The total integral is correct (1H), meaning the sample contains two different species, each having that proton, and they are present in roughly a 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two peaks must represent the same proton in two different chemical environments. This points to the presence of isomers.\n\n*   **Analyze the LC-MS Data:** The LC (Liquid Chromatography) separates the crude compound into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different species in a 1:1 ratio that are separable based on their physical properties (like polarity). The MS (Mass Spectrometry) data shows that both peaks correspond to compounds of the same mass, and this mass matches the expected product.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different mass. The MS data rules this out.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical chemical and physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished or separated by standard 1H NMR or by a standard (achiral) LC column. This explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid was added, resulting in a molecule with a significantly larger mass. The MS data rules this out.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in two diastereomers would have different chemical shifts, explaining the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) LC, explaining the two peaks. The identical mass is also explained, as diastereomers are isomers and thus have the same molecular formula and mass.\n        *   **Plausibility in Peptides:** This is a common occurrence in peptide synthesis. Two common ways this happens are: 1) Racemization of an amino acid's alpha-carbon during the coupling reaction, leading to a mixture of, for example, L-L and D-L peptides. 2) The presence of a proline residue, where the peptide bond preceding it can exist as both *cis* and *trans* rotamers. These rotamers are diastereomeric, interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale, and are often separable by HPLC. Both scenarios result in a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of two species that have the same mass but are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
