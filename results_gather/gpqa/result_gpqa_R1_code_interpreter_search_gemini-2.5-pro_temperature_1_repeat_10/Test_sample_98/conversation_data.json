    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the structures.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe crucial information lies in the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals, which are determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons according to the n+1 rule.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated compounds, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means the proton giving this signal is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to two adjacent equivalent protons (n=2), typically a CH₂ group.\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to three adjacent equivalent protons (n=3), typically a CH₃ group.\n    *   So, we are looking for a CH proton that has a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group on its adjacent carbons.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means the proton giving this signal is also coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to two adjacent equivalent protons (n=2), a CH₂ group.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to another, different set of two adjacent equivalent protons (n=2), another CH₂ group.\n    *   So, we are looking for a CH proton that has a CH and two different CH₂ groups on its adjacent carbons.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain of each candidate molecule. We'll label the carbons starting from the COOH group (C1 is the carboxyl carbon, C2 is the alpha-carbon, C3 is the beta-carbon, etc.).\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n           C₂H₅     C₂H₅\n           |        |\n      CH₃-CH₂--CH(β)--CH(α)--COOH\n```\n*   **H-α:** Coupled to H-β (1H → doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H → triplet). **Signal: dt (doublet of triplets)**.\n*   **H-β:** Coupled to H-α (1H → doublet), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H → triplet), and the terminal CH₂ of the main chain (2H → triplet). **Signal: dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets)**.\n*   This molecule has a `dtt` signal but lacks a `dtq` signal. Therefore, it is not the correct compound.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n           CH₃     CH₃\n           |       |\n      CH₃-CH₂--CH(β)--CH(α)--COOH\n```\n*   **H-α:** Coupled to H-β (1H → doublet) and the CH₃ on its carbon (3H → quartet). **Signal: dq (doublet of quartets)**.\n*   **H-β:** Coupled to H-α (1H → doublet), the CH₃ on its carbon (3H → quartet), and the CH₂ of the main chain (2H → triplet). **Signal: dqt (or dtq, doublet of triplets of quartets)**.\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` signal but lacks a `dtt` signal. Therefore, it is not the correct compound.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n                CH₃      CH₃\n                |        |\n           CH₃--CH(γ)--CH(β)--CH₂(α)--COOH\n```\n*   **H-β:** Coupled to H-γ (1H → doublet), the two H-α protons (2H → triplet), and the CH₃ on its carbon (3H → quartet). **Signal: dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets)**.\n*   **H-γ:** Coupled to H-β (1H → doublet), the CH₃ on its carbon (3H → quartet), and the terminal CH₃ of the main chain (3H → quartet). **Signal: dqq (doublet of quartets of quartets)**.\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` signal but lacks a `dtt` signal. Therefore, it is not the correct compound.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n                C₂H₅     C₂H₅\n                |        |\n           CH₃--CH(γ)--CH(β)--CH₂(α)--COOH\n```\n*   **H-β:** Coupled to H-γ (1H → doublet), the two H-α protons (2H → triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on its carbon (2H → triplet). **Signal: dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H-γ:** Coupled to H-β (1H → doublet), the CH₂ of the ethyl group on its carbon (2H → triplet), and the terminal CH₃ of the main chain (3H → quartet). **Signal: dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nMolecule C is the only candidate that exhibits signals with both a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt) splitting pattern and a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) splitting pattern in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
