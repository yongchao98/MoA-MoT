    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to place a bromine atom on the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclohexanone.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reaction:** We have an α-haloketone with a proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position). When treated with a strong base like NaOH and heated, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement.\n*   **Mechanism:** The base removes the α'-proton to form an enolate. The enolate then undergoes an intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, displacing the bromide to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl group, leading to the opening of the strained three-membered ring. This results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** After protonation during workup, the product is Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n*   **Reaction:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to primary alcohols.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds), the carbon on the ring to which it is attached (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\nLet's count the number of non-equivalent hydrogen environments (which would correspond to distinct signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum):\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (CHO):** This proton lies on the plane of symmetry. Its chemical environment is unique. (1 type of H)\n2.  **The C1 Proton:** This is the proton on the carbon of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. It also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type of H)\n3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons (a CH₂ group). These two geminal protons are diastereotopic because the ring has a prochiral center at C1. This means they are in chemically different environments. One is 'cis' and one is 'trans' relative to the aldehyde group with respect to the average plane of the ring. Due to the overall symmetry of the molecule, the 'cis' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5, and the 'trans' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5. This gives us two distinct sets of protons for the C2/C5 positions. (2 types of H)\n4.  **The C3 and C4 Protons:** These two carbons are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to their corresponding partners on C4. This gives another two distinct sets of protons. (2 types of H)\n\n**Tally:**\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1 proton)\n*   Set 3: C2-H & C5-H (one side, 2 protons total)\n*   Set 4: C2-H & C5-H (other side, 2 protons total)\n*   Set 5: C3-H & C4-H (one side, 2 protons total)\n*   Set 6: C3-H & C4-H (other side, 2 protons total)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
