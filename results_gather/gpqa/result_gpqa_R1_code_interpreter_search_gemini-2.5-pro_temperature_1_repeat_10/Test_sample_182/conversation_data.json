    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactant and Reagents**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess of Hydrogen Iodide (HI)\n\n**2. Analyze the Structure of the Reactant**\n\nLet's break down the name to understand the structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group is present. By convention, this is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position 5.\n\nThe structure contains several features that contribute to its index of hydrogen deficiency (unsaturation):\n*   One ring.\n*   One C=C double bond within the ring.\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is C10H12O3. We can calculate its IHD as a check:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis matches the 5 features listed above (1 ring + 4 pi bonds).\n\n**3. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. This is a very powerful reducing agent used for complete reduction. Its effects are:\n*   It reduces carbonyl groups (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) completely to alkanes.\n    *   Aldehyde (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is also reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces alcohols (-OH) to alkanes.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P/HI to our reactant:\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond is reduced).\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at C1 (-COOH) is reduced to a **methyl** group (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl** group at C2 (-CHO) is reduced to a **methyl** group (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl** group at C5 (-CH=CH2) is reduced to an **ethyl** group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe resulting product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**. This is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n**5. Determine the Molecular Formula of the Product**\n\nLet's count the atoms in 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 carbons in the cyclohexane ring + 1 carbon in the first methyl group + 1 carbon in the second methyl group + 2 carbons in the ethyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** A saturated monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane) has the general formula CnH2n. Since our product has 10 carbons (n=10), its formula is C10H(2*10) = C10H20.\n\n**6. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD (or degree of unsaturation) quantifies the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the structure**\n    The product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\n    *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the molecular formula**\n    The formula for IHD is: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (where C, H, N are the number of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms respectively; oxygen and halogens are ignored for this formula variant).\n    For the product C10H20:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
