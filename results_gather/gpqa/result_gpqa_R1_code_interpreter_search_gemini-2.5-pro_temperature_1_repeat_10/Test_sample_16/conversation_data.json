    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation of this complex is represented by the equilibrium:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Define the formation constant (K_f):** The equilibrium constant for this reaction, also known as the stability or formation constant, is given as $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. The expression for K_f is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n3.  **Consider the dissociation:** We are starting with the complex and want to find the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions that result from its dissociation. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n    | Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    | ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n    | $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n    | $[Ca^{2+}]$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n    | $[EDTA^{4-}]$       | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n    The problem states the pH is \"ideal\", which implies that we can consider the fully deprotonated EDTA form ($EDTA^{4-}$) and do not need to account for pH-dependent protonation states.\n\n5.  **Substitute into the equilibrium expression:** Now, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n6.  **Apply a simplifying assumption:** The formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), which indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex. This means very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n7.  **Solve for x:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Take the square root to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n    Since $\\sqrt{36} = 6$ and $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.32.\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    This matches option D.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely:\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<<<D>>>",
