    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158, with a relative intensity of 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%), is highly significant. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl isotope, ~75%, and the ³⁷Cl isotope, ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, which is often found between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is diagnostic for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It appears as a singlet ('s') because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with, and its integration for one proton ('1H') confirms this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other, leading to this simplified pattern. The two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesizing the Evidence:**\n\n*   From MS, we know the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   From IR and ¹H NMR, we know it contains a carboxylic acid group.\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know it has a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting it all together, the unknown compound is a benzoic acid with a chlorine atom attached in the *para* (or 4-) position. This structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check if this fits all the data:\n*   **Structure:** 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **Molecular Weight:** (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope). This matches the MS data.\n*   **Functional Groups:** Contains a carboxylic acid and a chlorine atom on a benzene ring, matching the IR data.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Contains a carboxylic acid proton (matches 11.0 ppm signal) and a *para*-disubstituted ring (matches the two doublets for 2H each). The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and would appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n\nAll evidence points to option C.\n\nLet's quickly rule out the other options:\n*   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Would have a different, more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR.\n*   B) Phenyl chloroformate: Lacks the carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad O-H in the IR or the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is an *ortho*-disubstituted ring, which would give a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic signals, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
