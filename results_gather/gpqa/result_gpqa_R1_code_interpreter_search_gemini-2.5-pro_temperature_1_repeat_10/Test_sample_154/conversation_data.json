    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Uncertainty**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the uncertainty (or standard deviation) $\\Delta A$ of an operator $A$ for a system in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n$(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\nwhere:\n*   $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$.\n*   $\\langle A^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A^2|\\psi\\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\nTo find $\\Delta P_z$, we need to calculate $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n**3. Identify the Given Information**\n\nWe are given the matrix representation of the operator $P_z$:\n$P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nAnd the state vector of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe corresponding bra vector, $\\langle\\psi|$, is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it's just the transpose:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, let's verify that the state is normalized:\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1/2)(-1/2) = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$.\nThe state is indeed normalized.\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nWe use the formula $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\nFirst, let's compute the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we multiply by $\\langle\\psi|$ from the left:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right) = 0$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n**5. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\cdot1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0\\cdot0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)\\cdot(-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$. First, let's compute $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we multiply by $\\langle\\psi|$ from the left:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( 1/4 + 0 + 1/4 \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nNow we substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the uncertainty:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n**Alternative Method (Using Eigenvalues and Probabilities)**\n\nThe basis vectors are eigenvectors of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $p_1 = +\\hbar$, $p_2 = 0$, and $p_3 = -\\hbar$.\nThe state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe coefficients are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$.\n\nThe probability of measuring each eigenvalue is $P(p_i) = |c_i|^2$:\n*   $P(+\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n*   $P(0) = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$\n*   $P(-\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i P(p_i) = (+\\hbar)(1/4) + (0)(1/2) + (-\\hbar)(1/4) = 0$.\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i^2 P(p_i) = (+\\hbar)^2(1/4) + (0)^2(1/2) + (-\\hbar)^2(1/4) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n$\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<A>>>"
