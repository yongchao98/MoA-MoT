    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, let's denote its formula as CxHy.\n*   It is saturated because it does not react further with hydrogen.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7 (100/7 ≈ 14.2857%). In chemistry problems, this often suggests using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for calculation.\n*   Let's verify this. The mass percentage of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CnHm is (m * 1) / (12n + m). If the formula is of the type CnH2n (cycloalkanes or alkenes), the percentage of H is (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it cannot be an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). All fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, Z and another compound D.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Since Z (a cycloalkane) does not react with bromine water, D must also not react.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means that the hydrogenation of D must yield Z.\n*   This implies that D has the same carbon skeleton as Z and is unsaturated. For D to not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound. Standard aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene do not react with bromine water without a catalyst.\n*   Let's check our potential candidates for Z:\n    *   If Z = Cyclopentane (C5H10), D would need to be a stable C5 aromatic hydrocarbon. None exist (cyclopentadienyl anion is aromatic, but not a neutral hydrocarbon). So, n=5 is ruled out.\n    *   If Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), D would be Benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions. This is a valid case.\n    *   If Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), D would be Toluene (C7H8). Toluene does not decolorize bromine water and hydrogenates to methylcyclohexane. This is also a valid case.\n    *   If Z = Cyclooctane (C8H16), D would be Cyclooctatetraene (C8H8). Cyclooctatetraene is not aromatic in the same way as benzene and behaves like a polyene, readily decolorizing bromine water. Thus, n=8 is ruled out.\n*   So, the problem is narrowed down to two possibilities: the C6 system or the C7 system.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (containing C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z. This means both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation that occurs on heated platinum. In this context, it refers to a catalytic hydrogen transfer. The most plausible scenario that results in an equimolar mixture Y from an equimolar mixture X is a specific combination of reactants undergoing Zelinsky disproportionation.\n*   Let's analyze the general stoichiometry of this reaction for a cycloalkene CnH(2n-2) (one double bond, k=1) and a cycloalkadiene CnH(2n-4) (two double bonds, k=2), which both yield a cycloalkane CnH2n (Z) and an aromatic compound CnH(2n-6) (D).\n    *   For a cycloalkene (k=1): 3 CnH(2n-2) → 2 CnH2n + 1 CnH(2n-6)\n    *   For a cycloalkadiene (k=2): 3 CnH(2n-4) → 1 CnH2n + 2 CnH(2n-6)\n*   If we start with an equimolar mixture of A (the cycloalkene) and B (the cycloalkadiene), say 3 moles of each, the total products will be:\n    *   From A: 2 moles of Z + 1 mole of D\n    *   From B: 1 mole of Z + 2 moles of D\n    *   Total: (2+1) = 3 moles of Z and (1+2) = 3 moles of D.\n*   This combination produces an equimolar mixture of Z and D, perfectly matching the problem description.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the C6 and C7 Cases and Find the Solution**\n\n*   **Case 1: The C6 System**\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n    *   D = Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n    *   B = A non-conjugated cyclohexadiene. The only one is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   This system fits all conditions. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n*   **Case 2: The C7 System**\n    *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)\n    *   D = Toluene (C7H8)\n    *   A = A methylcyclohexene (C7H12).\n    *   B = A non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (e.g., 1-methylcyclohexa-2,5-diene, C7H10).\n    *   This system also fits all conditions. The total number of hydrogen atoms would be 12 + 10 = 22.\n\n*   **Distinguishing Between C6 and C7**\n    *   Both cases are chemically plausible and consistent with all the statements. However, chemistry problems of this type usually have a unique solution. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the parent, unsubstituted, and most classic textbook example of Zelinsky disproportionation. In the absence of further information, it is the most reasonable interpretation of \"a certain hydrocarbon Z\". The problem is likely designed around this fundamental example.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nBased on the conclusion that the C6 system is the intended subject of the problem:\n*   Liquid A is Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n*   Liquid B is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) is the sum of hydrogen atoms in A and B.\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
