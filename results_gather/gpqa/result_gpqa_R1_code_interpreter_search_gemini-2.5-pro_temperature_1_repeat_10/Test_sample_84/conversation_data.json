    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n- $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n- $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nWe need to compute the ratio for the two planets:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, most terms in the equation cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity, or RV semi-amplitude ($K$), by the formula:\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a star with a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n(This assumes the planet's mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$, and the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected via both transit and RV methods).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis ($a$):\n$K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n\nThe constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is directly proportional to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$):\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n**6. Substitute Given Values and Compute**\nWe are given:\n- Mass of Planet1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 $M_{Earth}$\n- Mass of Planet2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 $M_{Earth}$\n- Doppler shift for Planet1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n- Doppler shift for Planet2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, find the required ratios:\n- Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n- RV ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow substitute these into the equation for the ratio of semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2$\n\nFinally, calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 \\right]^{1/2}$\n\nThe square and the square root cancel each other out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we perform the division.\n```python\n# Final calculation for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures\nratio = 15 / 28\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe value ~0.53 is the closest match.\n\n<<<A>>>",
