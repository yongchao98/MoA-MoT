    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's determine the structure and identify the stereocenter. The IUPAC name indicates a 6-carbon chain (hexane). A ketone group is at position 3, and a methoxy group is at position 5.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃\n    *   The problem states there is a stereocenter at position 5 with (S) configuration. This center is not involved in the reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The C3 carbon is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can occur from two different faces of the planar carbonyl group. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3, which can be either (R) or (S). The original stereocenter at C5 remains (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. The configuration is the same at C5 but different at C3. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers are distinct compounds with different physical properties. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" means both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric around the central CH₂ group (C3). The substituents on C2 and C4 are identical (H, OH, CH₃, and the rest of the molecule).\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a **pair of enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry (when in the right conformation) and is superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 4R) form. Therefore, (2R, 4S) is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Products:** Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n*   From Reaction I: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. (Two diastereomers)\n*   From Reaction II: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol. (A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound, which is a diastereomer of the enantiomers).\n\n**A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It can separate **constitutional isomers** and **diastereomers**.\n*   It **cannot** separate **enantiomers**, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the separable groups:\n    1.  The two products from Reaction I are **diastereomers**. They have different properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak for the meso compound**.\n    3.  The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated from each other and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak for the enantiomeric pair**.\n    4.  The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They are constitutional isomers (if they had the same formula) or, in this case, simply completely different molecules with different structures, formulas, and polarities. They will certainly be separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks = (Peak for product 1 from Rxn I) + (Peak for product 2 from Rxn I) + (Peak for meso compound from Rxn II) + (Peak for enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation)**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of **enantiomers** in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, every stereoisomerically distinct compound in the mixture can be separated from the others (assuming an effective column).\n*   Let's count the distinct compounds:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n*   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
