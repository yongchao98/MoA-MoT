    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which requires the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen** (a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Its structure is a cyclic diketone with a conjugated system of double bonds.\n        *   The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (C=O) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n        *   These adjacent carbons have no hydrogen atoms attached.\n        *   Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they possess alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerization to form its enol isomer, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**. This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable, so the equilibrium strongly favors the enol form.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** (enantiomerism) occurs in molecules that are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a **chiral center** (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n        *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is the *trans* isomer.\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the C=C double bond.\n        *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry are **achiral** and thus cannot show optical isomerism. They are optically inactive.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
