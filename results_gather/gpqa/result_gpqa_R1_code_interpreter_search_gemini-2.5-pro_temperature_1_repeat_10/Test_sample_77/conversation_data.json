    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Li√©nard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n**1. Definitions and Setup**\n\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: The time at which the field is observed at point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   `tr`: The retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`. The signal travels at the speed of light `c`.\n*   The relationship between `t` and `tr` is given by:\n    $t = t_r + \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n*   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$\n*   `d`: The magnitude of $\\vec{d}$, i.e., the distance the signal traveled.\n    $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$\n    So, the retarded time condition simplifies to $t - t_r = d/c$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'} \\bigg|_{t'=t_r}$\n\n**2. Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar and vector potentials in the Lorenz gauge are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n**3. Derivation of the Scalar Potential V**\n\nSubstituting the charge density for a point charge into the formula for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integral is tricky because the retarded time $t_r'$ in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A standard result from electrodynamics for evaluating this integral is:\n$\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}\\right)}$\nwhere $t_r$ is the unique retarded time satisfying $t = t_r + |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$.\n\nUsing our notation ($\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$, $d=|\\vec{d}|$, $\\vec{v}=\\vec{v}(t_r)$), the integral becomes:\n$\\frac{1}{d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**4. Derivation of the Vector Potential A**\n\nThe process for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is analogous. We substitute the current density $\\vec{J}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nThe integral evaluates similarly, but with an extra factor of $\\vec{v}(t_r) = \\vec{v}$ in the numerator:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**5. Comparison with Options**\n\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\n*   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n*   $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option A.\n\n*   Option B and C use the static potential form, which is incorrect as it neglects the retardation effect.\n*   Option D has the wrong sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}$), which would correspond to advanced potentials (violating causality) rather than retarded potentials.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are those given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
