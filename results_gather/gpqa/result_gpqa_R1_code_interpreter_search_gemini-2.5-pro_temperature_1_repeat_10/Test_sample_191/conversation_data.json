    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged conducting sphere of radius R. Inside this conductor, there is an off-center spherical cavity. A point charge of +q is placed somewhere within this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero.\n\n3.  **Consider the effect of the charge +q in the cavity (Gauss's Law):** Let's imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. Since the electric field everywhere on this Gaussian surface is zero, the total electric flux through it is zero. According to Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$), the total charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. The enclosed charge consists of the point charge +q inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    Therefore, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of -q gets induced on the inner wall of the cavity.\n\n4.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). After the charge induction, a charge of -q has appeared on its inner surface. To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor itself, a charge of +q must appear on its outer surface. So, we have:\n    *   Charge inside the cavity: +q\n    *   Charge on the inner surface of the conductor: -q\n    *   Charge on the outer surface of the conductor: +q\n    The net charge of the conductor remains zero (-q + q = 0), and the total charge of the whole system is +q.\n\n5.  **Principle of Electrostatic Shielding:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all three charge distributions: the +q in the cavity, the -q on the inner surface, and the +q on the outer surface.\n    A crucial consequence of the E=0 property inside a conductor is electrostatic shielding. The charges within the cavity (+q) and on the cavity wall (-q) arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. This ensures the field within the conductor remains zero. Therefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the contribution to the electric field from the charge +q in the cavity and the induced charge -q on the inner surface is zero.\n\n6.  **Calculate the field from the outer surface charge:** This means the electric field at point P is solely due to the charge +q residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. Since there are no external electric fields and the outer surface is a perfect sphere, this charge +q will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic potential energy.\n\n7.  **Apply the Shell Theorem:** According to the shell theorem (which is a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is +q.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center of the conductor is L.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at point P is therefore given by the formula for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The radius of the cavity (r), the displacement of its center (s), the distance of P from the cavity's center (l), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all extraneous pieces of information designed to test the understanding of the core concept of electrostatic shielding. The field outside the conductor depends only on the net charge that appears on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
