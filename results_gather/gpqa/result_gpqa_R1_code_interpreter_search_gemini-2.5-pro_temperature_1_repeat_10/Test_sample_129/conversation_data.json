    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Rest Wavelength:** The problem states that the absorption occurs at the Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) wavelength, which is the transition from the n=2 to n=1 energy level in a neutral hydrogen atom. The rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) for this transition is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å).\n\n2.  **Identify the Observational Constraint:** The detection is to be done with \"optical ground-based telescopes\". The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The atmosphere starts to become transparent in the optical window at wavelengths longer than about 3500 Å to 4000 Å. This is known as the atmospheric cutoff. Any light with a wavelength shorter than this will be absorbed by the atmosphere (primarily by ozone) and will not reach a ground-based telescope. Therefore, to be detected, the Lyman-alpha line must be shifted to a wavelength longer than this cutoff. Let's use a conservative value of λ_obs_min ≈ 3500 Å as the minimum observable wavelength.\n\n3.  **Apply the Redshift Formula:** The redshift (z) relates the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) of light emitted by a source to the wavelength we observe (λ_obs) using the formula:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Redshift:** We need to find the lower limit, or the minimum value of 'z', for which the Lyman-alpha line becomes detectable. This occurs when the observed wavelength is equal to the minimum observable wavelength set by the atmospheric cutoff.\n    λ_obs_min = λ_rest * (1 + z_min)\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for z_min:\n    1 + z_min = λ_obs_min / λ_rest\n    z_min = (λ_obs_min / λ_rest) - 1\n\n5.  **Substitute the values and compute:**\n    *   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n    *   λ_obs_min ≈ 3500 Å\n\n    Now, let's perform the calculation.\n    ```python\n    lambda_rest = 1216  # Angstroms\n    lambda_obs_min = 3500  # Approximate atmospheric cutoff in Angstroms\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum redshift\n    z_min = (lambda_obs_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n    \n    print(z_min)\n    ```\n    \n    Executing this calculation:\n    z_min = (3500 / 1216) - 1\n    z_min ≈ 2.878 - 1\n    z_min ≈ 1.878\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated minimum redshift is approximately 1.88. Now we compare this value to the given choices:\n    A) 1.2\n    B) 3\n    C) 2.4\n    D) 1.9\n\n    The calculated value z ≈ 1.88 is closest to 1.9. Let's check the observed wavelength for z=1.9:\n    λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 * 2.9 = 3526.4 Å.\n    This wavelength is just above the atmospheric cutoff of ~3500 Å and would be detectable. For any redshift lower than this (like option A), the line would still be in the UV and blocked by the atmosphere. For higher redshifts (options B and C), the line would be even more easily detectable, but the question asks for the *lower limit*. Therefore, 1.9 is the best answer for the minimum redshift.\n\n<<<D>>>"
