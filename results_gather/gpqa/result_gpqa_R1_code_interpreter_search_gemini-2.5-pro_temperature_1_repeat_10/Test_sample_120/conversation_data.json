    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons. The numbering `[4.1.0]` indicates the bridgeheads are separated by 4 carbons on one side, 1 carbon on the other, and 0 carbons on the bridge. This doesn't quite match a simple epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. A more standard name for a cyclohexane epoxide is 1,2-epoxycyclohexane. However, `bicyclo[4.1.0]` is the standard nomenclature for a system where a cyclopropane ring is fused to a cyclohexane ring. `7-oxa` means atom 7, the single-atom bridge, is an oxygen. This confirms it's a cyclohexane ring (atoms 1 through 6) with an epoxide between C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** `1,3,4-trimethyl` means there are methyl groups on carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The configuration at the four chiral centers is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\nLet's determine the 3D structure from this information. We'll use a flat representation of the cyclohexane ring with wedges (up, beta) and dashes (down, alpha) to represent the stereochemistry.\n\n1.  **Epoxide and C1/C6:** For the bicyclic system, the epoxide ring must be cis-fused. Let's assume the oxygen atom is **up (wedge)**.\n2.  **Stereocenter C1 (1R):** C1 is bonded to O, C6, C2, and a methyl group. The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities are O > C6 > C2 > Me. To have an R configuration with the O atom pointing up, the lowest priority group (the methyl) must be **down (dash)**. (Viewing from the Me-C1 bond, O→C6→C2 is clockwise, so R).\n3.  **Stereocenter C6 (6S):** C6 is bonded to O, C1, C5, and H. The CIP priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. With the O atom up, for an S configuration, the lowest priority group (H) must be **down (dash)**. (Viewing from the H-C6 bond, O→C1→C5 is counter-clockwise, so S).\n4.  **Stereocenter C3 (3R):** C3 is bonded to C4, C2, a methyl group, and H. The CIP priorities are C4 > C2 > Me > H. For a 3R configuration, the H must be **down (dash)** and the methyl group **up (wedge)**. (Viewing from the H-C3 bond, C4→C2→Me is clockwise, so R).\n5.  **Stereocenter C4 (4R):** C4 is bonded to C3, C5, a methyl group, and H. The CIP priorities are C3 > C5 > Me > H. For a 4R configuration, the H must be **down (dash)** and the methyl group **up (wedge)**. (Viewing from the H-C4 bond, C3→C5→Me is clockwise, so R).\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide Oxygen: Up (beta)\n*   C1-Methyl: Down (alpha)\n*   C3-Methyl: Up (beta)\n*   C4-Methyl: Up (beta)\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of the soft nucleophile `CH₃⁻`.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Gilman reagents attack the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to 4 other carbons if we count the oxygen as part of a C-O-C chain).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to 3 other carbons).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond, leading to an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product Structure\n\n1.  **Attack:** The `CH₃⁻` nucleophile attacks C6. Since the C6-O bond is **up (beta)**, the methyl group must attack from **down (alpha)**.\n2.  **Inversion:** The attack causes an inversion at C6. The original H atom at C6 was **down (alpha)**. It will \"flip\" to an **up (beta)** position. The new methyl group is added in a **down (alpha)** position.\n3.  **Ring Opening:** The C6-O bond breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, which is still attached to C1. This forms an alkoxide O⁻.\n4.  **Workup:** An implicit aqueous workup step protonates the alkoxide (O⁻) to form a hydroxyl group (-OH). Since the original C1-O bond was **up (beta)**, the resulting -OH group will also be **up (beta)**.\n5.  **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-making steps, so their configurations remain unchanged relative to the rest of the molecule.\n\n**Summary of Product Structure (Relative Stereochemistry):**\n*   The cyclohexane ring is now open. The product is a cyclohexanol.\n*   **Original C1:** Has an -OH group **up (beta)** and a methyl group **down (alpha)**.\n*   **Original C6:** Has the new methyl group **down (alpha)** and an H atom **up (beta)**.\n*   **Original C3:** Has a methyl group **up (beta)** and an H atom **down (alpha)**.\n*   **Original C4:** Has a methyl group **up (beta)** and an H atom **down (alpha)**.\n\n### 4. Name the Product and Assign Stereochemistry\n\nFirst, we need to apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to the product.\n*   **Parent Name:** It is a substituted cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group is C1.\n*   **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the substituents (the four methyl groups) the lowest possible locants. The -OH is on C1 (original C1). The new methyl is on the adjacent carbon (original C6). Let's call this C2. The other methyls are on the original C3 and C4.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1(OH): Me groups are at C1, C2 (from original C6), C4 (from original C4), and C5 (from original C3). This gives the locant set **1,2,4,5**.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give 1,3,4,6.\n    *   The set 1,2,4,5 is lower than 1,3,4,6, so this is the correct numbering.\n*   **Full Name:** The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\nNow, we must determine the absolute configuration (R/S) for each stereocenter in the product.\n\n*   **Product C1 (original C1):** Has OH (up), Me (down). Priorities: OH > C2(CH-Me) > C6(CH₂) > Me. The lowest priority group (Me) is down (dash). The path OH→C2→C6 is clockwise. → **1R**.\n*   **Product C2 (original C6):** Has new Me (down), H (up). Priorities: C1(C-OH) > C3(CH₂) > Me > H. The lowest priority group (H) is up (wedge). The path C1→C3→Me is clockwise. Since H is up, we reverse the result. → **2S**.\n*   **Product C4 (original C4):** Has Me (up), H (down). Priorities: C5(CH-Me) > C3(CH₂) > Me > H. The lowest priority group (H) is down (dash). The path C5→C3→Me is clockwise. → **4R**.\n*   **Product C5 (original C3):** Has Me (up), H (down). Priorities: C4(CH-Me) > C6(CH₂) > Me > H. The lowest priority group (H) is down (dash). The path C4→C6→Me is clockwise. → **5R**.\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
