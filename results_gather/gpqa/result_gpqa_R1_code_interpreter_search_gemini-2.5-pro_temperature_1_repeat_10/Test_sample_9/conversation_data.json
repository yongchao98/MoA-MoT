    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the concept of density:** Density is defined as mass per unit volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. Therefore, density is directly proportional to mass and inversely proportional to the cube of the radius.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline, which is Earth itself. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This is a key scenario. When a planet has the same composition (e.g., the same ratio of iron, silicates, etc.) but is more massive, its self-gravity is much stronger. This increased gravitational force compresses the material of the planet, forcing the atoms closer together. This gravitational compression leads to a significant increase in the planet's overall density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass rocky planet will be substantially denser than Earth.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This is the opposite of scenario (c). With less mass, the gravitational compression is weaker. The material is less squeezed, resulting in an overall density that is *lower* than Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to significant gravitational compression)\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower gravitational compression)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The planet in option (c) is the most massive among the options with a rocky composition. Its greater mass leads to the strongest gravitational compression, resulting in the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
