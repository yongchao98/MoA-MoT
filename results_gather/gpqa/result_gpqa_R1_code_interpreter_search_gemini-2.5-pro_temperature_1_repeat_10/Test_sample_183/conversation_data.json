    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n*   At C1: an ethoxy group (-OEt), which is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   At C2: a tert-butyl group (-tBu), which is a weakly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   At C3: a nitro group (-NO2), which is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-pattern is often challenging due to competing directing effects. A direct three-step electrophilic substitution on benzene is unlikely to yield this specific product in high yield. This suggests a more complex strategy involving functional group interconversions and/or the use of blocking groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents Provided in the Options**\nThe options provide a set of standard reagents for aromatic chemistry:\n*   **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add a -tBu group. This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene).\n*   **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration to add a -NO2 group.\n*   **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of a primary amine (-NH2) to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **H3O+, H2O/Heat** or **dilute H2SO4**: Can be used for several purposes, including converting a diazonium salt to a phenol (-OH) or removing a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H, desulfonation).\n*   **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation to add a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). This group is a meta-director and can be used as a \"blocking group\" because it can be removed later in the synthesis.\n*   **NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis to convert a phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt).\n\n**3. Devise a Plausible Retrosynthesis**\nWorking backward from the product:\n*   The final -OEt group is likely introduced from a phenol (-OH) via Williamson ether synthesis. This means the penultimate intermediate is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   Now, how to make 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol (1-OH, 2-tBu, 3-NO2)?\n    *   Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylphenol would not work. The strong ortho, para-directing -OH and -tBu groups would direct the nitration to positions 4 and 6, not 3.\n    *   This strongly implies the use of a blocking group to force nitration into the desired, but normally unfavored, position. The -SO3H group is the perfect candidate for this role.\n\n**4. The Blocking Group Strategy**\nHere's a plausible pathway using a sulfonic acid blocking group:\n1.  **Synthesize 2-tert-butylphenol**: This intermediate itself needs to be made from benzene. A possible route is:\n    a.  **Alkylation**: Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n    b.  **Nitration**: tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → mixture of o- and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. For this synthesis, we must separate the **ortho-isomer**. (This is a weakness in terms of \"high yield,\" but necessary for the final structure).\n    c.  **Reduction**: o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → o-tert-butylaniline.\n    d.  **Diazotization**: o-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → o-tert-butyldiazonium salt.\n    e.  **Hydrolysis**: diazonium salt + H3O+/Heat → **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n2.  **Block the para-position**: Take 2-tert-butylphenol and sulfonate it. The -OH and -tBu groups are both o,p-directors. They cooperatively direct the incoming -SO3H group to position 4 (para to -OH, ortho to -tBu).\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **Nitrate the blocked phenol**: Now, nitrate this intermediate.\n    *   The powerful -OH group directs ortho/para (position 6 is open).\n    *   The -tBu group directs ortho/para (position 6 is open).\n    *   The -SO3H group directs meta (positions 3 and 5).\n    *   While position 6 is electronically and sterically favored, nitration of highly activated phenols can sometimes occur at unusual positions. The presence of the blocking group at C4 and the bulky tBu at C2 sterically shields the ring, potentially forcing the nitration into the hindered C3 position (ortho to -OH, meta to -SO3H). This is the crucial, non-obvious step required to build the 1,2,3-pattern.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitro-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Remove the blocking group**: Treat with dilute acid and heat (desulfonation) to remove the -SO3H group.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n5.  **Form the ether**: React with NaOH and EtBr to convert the phenol to an ethoxy group.\n    *   Final Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options based on the derived pathway**\nThe derived synthetic sequence is complex. Let's examine the options to see which one aligns with this logic. The key is that the synthesis must start by creating a 1,2,4-substituted intermediate (e.g., 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-4-sulfonic acid) which is then converted to the key phenol precursor (2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid).\n\nLet's trace the initial steps of Option A:\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: tert-butylbenzene → o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (we must follow the minor isomer).\n*   **iii) SO3/H2SO4**: o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → 2-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (Sulfonation is directed to the position para to the t-butyl group).\n\nThe rest of the steps in Option A are written in a chemically illogical order (e.g., diazotization before reduction). However, Option A is the only one that begins with the correct sequence of introductions (alkylation, nitration, sulfonation) needed to establish the framework for the blocking group strategy I outlined. If we assume the list of reagents in A is correct but the order is scrambled, these reagents can be arranged to execute the valid synthesis. The other options either lead to an incorrect isomer (like D) or are fundamentally flawed in other ways. For instance, the path derived from Option D's reagents logically yields **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, an isomer of the target.\n\nGiven the flaws in all options as written, we choose the one whose initial steps and reagent list are most consistent with the only plausible (though complex) route to the target molecule. The sequence `Alkylation -> Nitration -> Sulfonation` is the correct start for setting up the required substituted pattern for the blocking group strategy.\n\n<<<A>>>"
