    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2. Its magnetic moment is given by the vector operator `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The components of the spin operator are `S_x`, `S_y`, and `S_z`, which are related to the Pauli matrices `σ_x, σ_y, σ_z` by `S_i = (ħ/2)σ_i`.\n    *   Initially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field `B_initial` in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the energy eigenstate corresponding to this field. The Hamiltonian for this initial setup is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γS_z * B`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` and spin-down `|-z>`. Their corresponding energy eigenvalues are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`.\n    *   \"Aligned with the field\" means the system is in the lowest energy state. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the one with the highest spin projection, `m_s = +1/2`. This corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n    *   So, the initial state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to be in the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. So, the new magnetic field is `B_new = B * y_hat`.\n    *   The Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B_new = -γ(S · B * y_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n    *   This new Hamiltonian will govern the time evolution of the state vector for `t > 0`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the System:**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   Substituting the Hamiltonian and the initial state: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB * S_y)t/ħ) |+z> = exp(iγBt * S_y/ħ) |+z>`.\n    *   Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The equation becomes `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωt * S_y/ħ) |+z>`.\n    *   Since `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, we have `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωt * (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) |+z> = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y) |+z>`.\n    *   We use the identity `exp(iθσ_n) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σ_n`, with `θ = ωt/2` and `n=y`.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (cos(ωt/2)I + i*sin(ωt/2)σ_y) |+z>`.\n    *   Applying this to the state `|+z>` (which is `[1, 0]` in the `S_z` basis):\n        *   `I |+z> = |+z>`.\n        *   `σ_y |+z> = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [[1], [0]] = [[0], [i]] = i * |-z>`.\n    *   Substituting these back: `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> + i*sin(ωt/2) * (i*|-z>) = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   First, let's find the action of `S_z` on `|ψ(t)>`:\n        *   `S_z |ψ(t)> = S_z (cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n        *   `S_z |ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)S_z|+z> - sin(ωt/2)S_z|-z>`\n        *   `S_z |ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>`\n        *   `S_z |ψ(t)> = (ħ/2) (cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`.\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product `<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n        *   `<ψ(t)| = cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|`.\n        *   `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)> = (ħ/2) (cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|) * (cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`.\n        *   Using the orthogonality of the basis states (`<+z|+z>=1`, `< -z|-z>=1`, `<+z|-z>=0`), the cross-terms vanish.\n        *   `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`.\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        *   `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(ωt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`.\n    *   This expression shows that `<μ_z(t)>` oscillates as a cosine function with time.\n    *   The general form of an oscillation is `A*cos(Ωt + φ)`. The angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω`.\n    *   In our case, the angular frequency is `ω`.\n    *   We defined `ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` precesses around the new magnetic field direction (Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis, `<S_z(t)>`, therefore oscillates with this same angular frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
