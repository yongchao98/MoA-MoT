    "Here's the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical process:** The problem describes the pair production process where two photons annihilate to create an electron-positron pair: $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$. We need to find the threshold energy ($E_\\gamma$) of the high-energy gamma-ray for this reaction to occur.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Four-Momentum:** In special relativity, the total four-momentum is conserved. The square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it is the same in all inertial reference frames.\n    Let the four-momenta be:\n    *   $p_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ for the high-energy gamma-ray.\n    *   $p_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$ for the CMB photon.\n    *   $p_{e^+} = (E_{e^+}, \\vec{p}_{e^+})$ for the positron.\n    *   $p_{e^-} = (E_{e^-}, \\vec{p}_{e^-})$ for the electron.\n\n    The conservation law is: $p_\\gamma + p_{CMB} = p_{e^+} + p_{e^-}$.\n    Squaring both sides gives: $(p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = (p_{e^+} + p_{e^-})^2$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Left-Hand Side (Initial State):**\n    $(p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2(p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB})$.\n    Since photons are massless, their four-momentum squared is zero ($p^2 = E^2 - (pc)^2 = 0$).\n    So, $p_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    The expression simplifies to $2(p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB})$.\n    The dot product of the two four-momenta is $p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - |\\vec{p}_\\gamma||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta$.\n    Using $E=pc$ for photons, this becomes $E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the incoming photons.\n    So, the left-hand side is $2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Right-Hand Side (Final State) at Threshold:**\n    The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction. At this minimum, the electron and positron are created with zero kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, the total four-momentum of the final state is $(m_e c^2 + m_e c^2, \\vec{0}) = (2m_e c^2, \\vec{0})$.\n    The square of this four-momentum is $(2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n    Since this value is a Lorentz invariant, it is the same in the lab frame.\n    So, $(p_{e^+} + p_{e^-})^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n5.  **Combine and Solve for the Threshold Energy:**\n    Equating the two sides:\n    $2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)}$\n\n    To find the *minimum* possible energy for $E_\\gamma$, we need to maximize the denominator, specifically the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. This occurs when the photons have a head-on collision, meaning $\\theta = \\pi$ (or 180°), which makes $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\n    The maximum value of $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n    Substituting this into the equation gives the threshold energy:\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(2)} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    We are given the following values:\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3}$ eV.\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511$ MeV = $0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the threshold energy formula:\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    To compare with the given options, we convert this energy to Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis result means that gamma-rays with energy at or above approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV will have their lifetime in the universe significantly limited because they can readily interact with the pervasive CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, effectively being absorbed. This is a key aspect of the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit.\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nD) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
