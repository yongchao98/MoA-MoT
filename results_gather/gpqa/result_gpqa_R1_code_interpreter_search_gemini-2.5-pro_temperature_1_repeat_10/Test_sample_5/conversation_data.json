    "The user wants to find the energy spectrum for a particle of mass 'm' in a two-dimensional potential.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    $V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \\frac{3}{2}kr^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    To simplify the problem, we convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The conversion formulas are:\n    *   $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n    *   $y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n    *   $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2}k(r \\cos(\\theta))^2$\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2}kx^2$\n\n    Now, combine the terms:\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2}k + \\frac{3}{2}k)x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{4}{2}k)x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n\n3.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential in Cartesian coordinates is separable: $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, where:\n    *   $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$\n    *   $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n\n    This is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The motion in the x-direction is independent of the motion in the y-direction. We can solve the Schrödinger equation for each dimension separately and add the energies.\n\n4.  **Solve for the x-direction:**\n    The potential for a standard 1D harmonic oscillator is $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x^2$.\n    Comparing this with $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$, we have:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_x^2 = 2k \\implies \\omega_x^2 = \\frac{4k}{m} \\implies \\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    The energy levels for the x-direction are given by:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}})$\n\n5.  **Solve for the y-direction:**\n    Similarly, for the y-direction, we compare $V(y) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2y^2$ with $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k \\implies \\omega_y^2 = \\frac{k}{m} \\implies \\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    The energy levels for the y-direction are given by:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n6.  **Find the Total Energy:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of the energies from the two independent dimensions:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n    Now, let's simplify the expression by factoring out $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n    $E = [2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2}] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) \\hbar\\sqrt{k/m}$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
