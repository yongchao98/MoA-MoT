    "This is a classic particle physics problem involving a two-body decay of a stationary particle. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Identify the process and given information:**\nThe decay is: Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu\nThe initial particle, the positive pion (Pi+), is stationary.\n\nGiven masses:\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) (m_pi * c^2) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) (m_mu * c^2) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered massless (m_nu * c^2 = 0).\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    Let 'p' be the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (p_mu) and the neutrino (p_nu).\n    p = p_mu = p_nu\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    Initial Energy (E_initial) = Rest energy of the stationary pion = m_pi * c^2\n    Final Energy (E_final) = Total energy of the muon (E_mu) + Total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n    So, m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation:\nE^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2\n\n*   For the muon (mu+):\n    E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2  =>  E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)\n\n*   For the neutrino (nu), since its mass is zero:\n    E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0  =>  E_nu = p*c\n\n**4. Solve for the unknowns:**\nWe can substitute the expressions for E_mu and E_nu into the energy conservation equation:\nm_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2) + p*c\n\nTo solve for 'p*c', we rearrange and square the equation:\nm_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)\n(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\n(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\nThe (p*c)^2 terms on both sides cancel out:\n(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) = (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\nNow, we solve for p*c:\np*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi*c^2) ]\n\n**5. Calculate the numerical values:**\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given rest masses in MeV\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the momentum of the products (p*c) in MeV\n# p*c = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\npc = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Calculate the Kinetic Energy (KE) of the neutrino\n# For a massless particle, Total Energy = Kinetic Energy\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# Calculate the Kinetic Energy (KE) of the muon\n# KE = Total Energy - Rest Energy\n# E_mu = m_pi - E_nu (from energy conservation)\nE_mu = m_pi - KE_nu\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# Print the results, formatted to two decimal places\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n\nThe calculation yields:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) is equal to its total energy, p*c ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n*   The kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) is its total energy minus its rest energy. From energy conservation, the muon's total energy is E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu = 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 MeV. Therefore, its kinetic energy is KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. Matching these with the options provided:\n\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principles:** The problem describes the decay of a single particle (pion) into two other particles (muon and neutrino). Since the initial pion is stationary, this is a classic two-body decay problem. The key principles to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum, within the framework of special relativity.\n\n2.  **State the Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, so its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles (mu+ and nu) must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n        *   `p_initial = 0`\n        *   `p_final = p_muon - p_neutrino = 0` => `p_muon = p_neutrino = p`\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where `p` is momentum, `m₀` is rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n        *   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): The pion is at rest, so its energy is purely its rest energy, `m_pi * c²`.\n        *   Final Energy (`E_final`): The sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. `E_final = E_muon + E_neutrino`.\n        *   Therefore: `m_pi * c² = E_muon + E_neutrino`.\n\n3.  **Formulate Equations for Product Particles:**\n    *   **Neutrino (nu):** The neutrino is considered (or has a negligible) rest mass. So, `m_nu = 0`. Its energy is purely kinetic.\n        *   `E_nu² = (pc)² + (0 * c²)²` => `E_nu = pc`.\n        *   The kinetic energy of the neutrino is `KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu*c² = pc - 0 = pc`.\n\n    *   **Muon (mu+):** The muon has a rest mass `m_mu`.\n        *   `E_muon² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`.\n        *   The kinetic energy of the muon is `KE_muon = E_muon - m_mu * c²`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknowns:**\n    We have a system of equations. We can substitute the energy expressions into the conservation of energy equation:\n    `m_pi * c² = E_muon + E_nu`\n    `m_pi * c² = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²) + pc`\n\n    To solve for `pc` (which is the neutrino's energy), we rearrange and square the equation:\n    `m_pi * c² - pc = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²)`\n    `(m_pi * c² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    `(m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\n    The `(pc)²` terms cancel out:\n    `(m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)(pc) = (m_mu * c²)²`\n\n    Now, solve for `pc`:\n    `2(m_pi * c²)(pc) = (m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n    `pc = [ (m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c²) ]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   **KE of Neutrino:** `KE_nu = pc`. We can calculate this value directly using the given rest masses.\n    *   **KE of Muon:** From the conservation of energy, `E_muon = m_pi * c² - E_nu`. Since `KE_muon = E_muon - m_mu * c²`, we have:\n        `KE_muon = (m_pi * c² - E_nu) - m_mu * c²`\n        `KE_muon = m_pi * c² - pc - m_mu * c²`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    The provided code output confirms the calculations derived from these formulas.\n    *   Given: `m_pi*c² = 139.6 MeV`, `m_mu*c² = 105.7 MeV`\n    *   `pc = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6) = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2 = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`.\n    *   Therefore, `KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`.\n    *   `KE_mu = 139.6 - 29.78 - 105.7 ≈ 4.12 MeV`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
