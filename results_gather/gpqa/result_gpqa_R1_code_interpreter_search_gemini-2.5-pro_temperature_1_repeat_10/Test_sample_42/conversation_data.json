    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Decode the description to build the chemical structure.\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The molecule has a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Since the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among all the given functional groups, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Relative Positions of Major Groups:**\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and a cyano group (-CN) are both *meta* to the carboxylic acid (at C1). This means they are at positions C3 and C5.\n    *   The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are also *meta* to one another. If one is at C3 and the other at C5, they are separated by C4, which is a meta relationship. This confirms the 1,3,5-substitution pattern for the -COOH, -CHO, and -CN groups.\n\n3.  **Positions of Other Substituents:**\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid (C1). The para position is C4. So, the methoxy group is at **C4**.\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid (C1). The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, these two groups are at C2 and C6.\n    *   **Crucial Constraint:** The methoxy group (at C4) and the alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile (cyano group, -CN).\n        *   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position (C3 or C5).\n        *   **Case a:** If the cyano group is at **C3**, the positions ortho to it are C2 and C4. We already know the methoxy group is at C4. The constraint says the hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the cyano group, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This leaves **C6** for the dimethylamino group and **C5** for the carbaldehyde group.\n        *   **Case b:** If the cyano group is at **C5**, the positions ortho to it are C4 and C6. Methoxy is at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This leaves **C2** for the dimethylamino group and **C3** for the carbaldehyde group.\n\n4.  **Finalizing the Structure:**\n    Let's assemble the structure from Case a:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n\n    Let's assemble the structure from Case b:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   C3: -CHO\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CN\n    *   C6: -OH\n\n    If you rotate the structure from Case b in the plane of the ring or flip it over, you will find it is the same molecule as the one from Case a. The IUPAC naming system is designed to give only one unique name for a single molecule, so we can proceed with either representation. We will use the structure derived from Case a.\n\n### Step 2: Apply IUPAC Naming Rules\n\n1.  **Numbering the Ring:** The carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is C1. We need to number the other carbons (C2 to C6) to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   **Clockwise (CW) numbering:** The substituents (-OH, -CN, -OCH3, -CHO, -N(CH3)2) get the locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise (CCW) numbering:** The substituents (-N(CH3)2, -CHO, -OCH3, -CN, -OH) get the locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n2.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** Since both numbering directions give the identical locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use the next rule: choose the numbering that gives the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n3.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n\n4.  **Apply the Tie-Breaker:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"Cyano\".\n    *   In the **CW** numbering, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In the **CCW** numbering, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **Clockwise (CW) numbering is correct**.\n\n5.  **Assign Final Locants:** Based on the correct CW numbering, the locants for the substituents are:\n    *   2-Hydroxy\n    *   3-Cyano\n    *   4-Methoxy\n    *   5-Formyl\n    *   6-Dimethylamino\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Final Name\n\nWrite the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number. Then, add the parent name.\n\n*   3-cyano-\n*   6-(dimethylamino)-  *(parentheses are used for complex substituents)*\n*   5-formyl-\n*   2-hydroxy-\n*   4-methoxy-\n*   benzoic acid\n\nCombining these gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Options\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: prefixes are not in alphabetical order)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: wrong locants and not alphabetized)\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: based on the wrong numbering direction)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
