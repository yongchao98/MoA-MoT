    "The problem asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. We are given its production energy ($E_X$), mass ($m_X$), and decay width ($\\Gamma_X$).\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Mean Decay Distance Formula:**\n    The mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle is the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n\n2.  **Relativistic Effects:**\n    The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation.\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    The velocity is $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta$ is the speed relative to the speed of light $c$.\n    So, the formula becomes:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$\n\n3.  **Proper Lifetime and Decay Width:**\n    The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) of a particle is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    Substituting this into the equation for $L$:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n4.  **Kinematic Relations:**\n    The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$\n    The relativistic momentum ($p$) is given by $p = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X \\beta c$.\n    From this, we can express the term $\\gamma \\beta c$ as:\n    $\\gamma \\beta c = \\frac{p}{m_X}$\n    Substituting this into the formula for $L$:\n    $L = \\frac{p}{m_X} \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    The momentum term $pc$ can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n    Therefore, $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n\n5.  **Final Formula and Calculation:**\n    Combining everything, the mean decay distance is:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   $E_X = 8$ GeV\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2$ GeV\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV $= 0.320$ GeV\n    *   The physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327$ MeV·fm $\\approx 0.197327$ GeV·fm.\n\n    First, calculate $pc$:\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 1.44} \\text{ GeV} = \\sqrt{62.56}$ GeV.\n\n    Now, calculate $L$:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} \\frac{0.197327 \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{0.320 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n    We can use a Python script for a precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE_X = 8.0  # GeV\nm_X = 1.2  # GeV\nGamma_X = 320.0  # MeV\n\n# Constants\n# hbar*c in MeV.fm (from CODATA)\nhbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804\n\n# 1.

    "The user has provided a physics problem and requires a step-by-step solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe goal is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Total energy of the meson, $E_X = 8$ GeV.\n*   Rest mass of the meson, $m_X c^2 = 1.2$ GeV. (Note: The problem states mass $m_X = 1.2$ GeV, which in particle physics units implies $m_X c^2 = 1.2$ GeV).\n*   Decay width of the meson, $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV.\n\n**3. Recall Relevant Formulas:**\n*   The mean decay distance ($L$) is the product of the particle's speed ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$):\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n*   Due to relativistic time dilation, the lab-frame lifetime is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n*   The speed is often expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $v = \\beta c$.\n*   Combining these, the mean decay distance is:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$\n*   The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   Substituting this into the equation for L gives:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n*   The term $\\gamma \\beta c$ can be expressed in terms of energy and momentum. From the relativistic momentum definition $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m \\beta c$, we get $\\gamma \\beta c = \\frac{p}{m}$. It is more convenient to use energies, so we multiply by $c/c$: $\\gamma \\beta c = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$.\n*   The relativistic momentum term $pc$ can be found from the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. This gives $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n*   Putting it all together, the final formula for calculation is:\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n**4. Plan the Calculation:**\n*   Ensure all units are consistent. We will use GeV for energy and MeV for the $\\hbar c / \\Gamma_X$ calculation.\n*   Calculate the momentum term $pc$ in GeV.\n*   Use the known value of the physical constant $\\hbar c$. A common value is $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327$ MeV·fm.\n*   Substitute all values into the final formula to find $L$ in femtometers (fm).\n*   Convert the final result from femtometers to meters (1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n*   Compare the calculated value with the given options.\n\n**5. Execute the Calculation (using Python):**\nThe steps outlined above can be efficiently and accurately performed using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE_X = 8.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm_X = 1.2  # Rest mass energy (m_X*c^2) in GeV\nGamma_X = 320.0  # Decay width in MeV\n\n# Physical constant\n# hbar*c in MeV.fm (from CODATA 2018)\nhbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the momentum term pc in GeV.\n# E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2  =>  pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m*c^2)^2)\npc = np.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X**2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay distance L using the formula:\n# L = (pc / (m_X*c^2)) * (hbar*c / Gamma_X)\n# The units will be (GeV / GeV) * (MeV.fm / MeV) which results in fm.\nL_fm = (pc / m_X) * (hbar_c_MeV_fm / Gamma_X)\n\n# Step 3: Convert the result from femtometers (fm) to meters (m).\n# 1 fm = 1e-15 m\nL_m = L_fm * 1e-15\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to compare with the options.\nprint(f\"{L_m:.4e}\")\n```\nThe code output is `4.0645e-15`.\n\n**6.

    "The mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle is given by the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n\n$L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n\nDue to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is related to the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n\n$\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\nThe velocity can be written as $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta$ is the speed as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$. So, the decay distance becomes:\n\n$L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$\n\nThe proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\n$\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.

From the definition of relativistic momentum, $p = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X \\beta c$, we have:\n\n$\\gamma \\beta c = \\frac{p}{m_X} = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2}$\n\nThe relativistic momentum can be found from the energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.
