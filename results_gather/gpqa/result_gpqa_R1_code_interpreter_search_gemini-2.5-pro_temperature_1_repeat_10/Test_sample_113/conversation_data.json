    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n    *   This reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `(CH3)(C2H5)C(O⁻)(CN)`.\n    *   To obtain the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   This requires a source of protons (H⁺). A dilute acid, represented as H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion), is used for this purpose. The reaction is typically carried out in a buffered solution or with the addition of a mineral acid to generate HCN in situ and to protonate the intermediate. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n    *   NaHSO₃ is used for the formation of bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n    *   This reaction is the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be achieved under either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, typically with heating.\n    *   The options for reagent B are HCl and CH₃COOH.\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, while CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid.\n    *   For the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, a strong acid catalyst like HCl is required. The reaction proceeds by protonation of the nitrile nitrogen, followed by nucleophilic attack by water, and a series of subsequent steps leading to the carboxylic acid and ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). A weak acid like CH₃COOH is generally not effective enough to drive this reaction to completion.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
