    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay exponentially. The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by `N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ₀)`, where `τ₀` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The lifetime of the particle measured in the lab frame, `τ`, is dilated by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ = γ * τ₀`\n    The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `v` is the particle's velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Survival Probability in the Lab Frame:**\n    The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector is `t_lab = R / v`, where `R` is the radius of the detector.\n    Since the particles are ultra-relativistic (`γ ~ 20`), their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. We can therefore approximate `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n    The survival probability `P` (the fraction of particles reaching the detector) in the lab frame is given by:\n    `P = exp(-t_lab / τ)`\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ`, we get:\n    `P = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `P = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Scenarios:**\n    The problem provides two scenarios. Let's denote the quantities for the first scenario with a subscript 1 and for the second scenario with a subscript 2.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Survival probability, `P₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Detector radius, `R = 30 m`\n\n        Plugging these into our equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ₀))`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Survival probability, `P₂ = 2/3`\n        *   Detector radius, `R = 30 m`\n        *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\n        Plugging these into our equation:\n        `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀))`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    We have a system of two equations. The term `c * τ₀` is an unknown constant related to the particle's properties. We can solve for it or eliminate it.\n\n    Let's take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n    From Scenario 1:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ₀)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ₀)` (Equation A)\n\n    From Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    `ln(3) - ln(2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)` (Equation B)\n\n    Now, we can find a relationship between the two scenarios by dividing Equation B by Equation A:\n    `(ln(3) - ln(2)) / ln(3) = [30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)] / [1.5 / (c * τ₀)]`\n    `(ln(3) - ln(2)) / ln(3) = (30 / γ₂) * (1 / 1.5)`\n    `(ln(3) - ln(2)) / ln(3) = 20 / γ₂`\n\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    To get the final numerical answer, we'll use a python script to compute the value of `γ₂`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of gamma_2 based on the derived formula\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.18511484251213\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation shows that `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`. This value is extremely close to the multiple-choice option C.\n\nFinal check of the logic: To increase the survival probability from 1/3 to 2/3, more particles need to survive the journey. This means their lifetime in the lab frame must be longer. Since the lab-frame lifetime `τ` is directly proportional to the Lorentz factor `γ` (`τ = γ * τ₀`), we expect the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` to be greater than the original `γ₁ = 20`. Our calculated result of ~54 is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n<<<C>>>",
