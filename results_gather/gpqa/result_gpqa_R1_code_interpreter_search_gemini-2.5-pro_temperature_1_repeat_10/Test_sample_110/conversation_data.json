    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it is a quaternary carbon with **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen. It is a tertiary carbon with **one α-proton**.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-proton at the C6 position to form the enolate. The double bond of the enolate will form between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate is the nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The β-carbon of ethyl acrylate is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The initial adduct is an ester enolate, which is then protonated during workup (usually with a mild acid or water) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The starting ketone has substituents at C2 (ethyl, methyl) and C6 (methyl).\n    *   The reaction adds an `ethyl propanoate` group (-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt) to the C6 carbon.\n    *   Therefore, the final product has the following substituents on the cyclohexanone ring:\n        *   C1: Carbonyl group (=O)\n        *   C2: Ethyl group, Methyl group (quaternary center)\n        *   C6: Methyl group, `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group (becomes a new quaternary center)\n    *   Let's analyze the names given in the options for Product A. The names treat the ethyl propanoate part as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n        *   **Option C/D Name:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n        *   Let's deconstruct this name to draw its structure:\n            *   Parent chain: `ethyl ...propanoate` is `(substituent)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. The substituent is on C3.\n            *   Substituent: `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`. Numbering of this ring starts from the point of attachment (C1).\n            *   C1 has a methyl group.\n            *   C2 has an oxo (=O) group.\n            *   C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n        *   This structure matches the connectivity of our product derived from the mechanism. If we renumber the product `O=C1-C2(Et,Me)-...-C6(Me, -CH₂CH₂COOEt)` such that the point of attachment is C1 and the carbonyl is at C2, we get a perfect match for substituents: C1 has a methyl, C2 is oxo, C3 has an ethyl and a methyl.\n        *   **Option A/B Name:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This name implies the oxo group is at C4 relative to the attachment point C1. This is inconsistent with the mechanism, where the addition must happen at an α-carbon (C6, which is adjacent to the carbonyl C1).\n    *   Therefore, the correct structure for Product A is described by the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-protons (on the CH₂ next to NO₂) acidic.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile), which is CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   CH₃-CH₂-C**H**₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  CH₃-CH₂-**C⁻H**-NO₂ + H₂O\n    *   This carbanion is stabilized by resonance with the nitro group.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   In CH₃-C**H**=CH-CN, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n        ```\n             NO₂         CH₃\n             |           |\n        CH₃CH₂-CH   +   CH-CH-CN\n                     |\n                     (attack)\n             NO₂     CH₃\n             |       |\n        CH₃CH₂-CH - CH - CH₂ - CN\n        ```\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's determine the IUPAC name of the resulting molecule: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so it will be named as a derivative of a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. So, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `C⁶H₃-C⁵H₂-C⁴H(NO₂)-C³H(CH₃)-C²H₂-C¹N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   Let's check the alternative name from the options: `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`. This would be a 4-carbon chain and would require different starting materials. It is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nMatching these products with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect A, Incorrect B\n*   B) Incorrect A, Correct B\n*   C) Correct A, Incorrect B\n*   D) Correct A, Correct B\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
