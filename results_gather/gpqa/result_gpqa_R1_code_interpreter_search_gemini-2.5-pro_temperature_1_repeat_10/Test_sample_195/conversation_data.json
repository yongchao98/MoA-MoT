    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Define the Total Relativistic Energy**\n    The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system is conserved. It is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy ($E$) and the potential energy ($U$) stored in the spring.\n    The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system at any point $x$ with velocity $v$ is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the System at Maximum Amplitude**\n    At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass momentarily comes to a stop.\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Velocity: $v = 0$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n    *   Potential energy: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Analyze the System at the Equilibrium Position**\n    The mass reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$, as it passes through the equilibrium position, $x=0$.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$\n    *   Velocity: $v = v_{max}$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Potential energy: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$)**\n    First, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ from the energy conservation equation:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Let's rearrange this to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n    Finally, substitute the expression we found for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The derived expression matches option A.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    *   B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$\n    *   D) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the classical, non-relativistic result)\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
