    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters, but this is not a guarantee, as molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (these are called meso compounds). A compound named with a specific stereochemical descriptor like (R) or (S) is a single enantiomer and is therefore optically active, unless it is a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `CH3CH2(CH3)C=CHCl`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond, but no chiral centers (a chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the atoms of the double bond).\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex, polycyclic molecule.\n    *   The name itself provides the crucial information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, C-3a as (R) and C-7a as (S), and the geometry of a double bond as (E).\n    *   Naming a specific stereoisomer with (R) and (S) designations implies that the molecule is chiral and that this is one of its enantiomers. It is highly unlikely that a molecule with such a complex and asymmetric structure would be meso.\n    *   Therefore, it is a single enantiomer and is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule has a symmetric structure (the two ends are identical -COOH groups).\n    *   The (2R,3S) stereoisomer has the two methyl groups on opposite sides in a Fischer projection and possesses a center of inversion. This makes it a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. They do not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom bonded to the -OH group (C1) is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=CH-, and -CH2-CH2-CH=. The two paths around the ring from C1 are different due to the location of the double bond.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a chiral center, and the molecule is chiral.\n    *   The name (R)-... specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This molecule has a highly symmetrical 1,3,5-substitution pattern on a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   There are two possible diastereomers: one where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis), and one where two are on one side and one is on the other (cis,trans).\n    *   Due to the high symmetry, both of these diastereomers possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The all-cis isomer has a C3 axis and three planes of symmetry. It is achiral.\n    *   The cis,trans isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the \"unique\" hydroxyl group and the carbon opposite to it. It is also achiral.\n    *   Since all possible stereoisomers of this compound are achiral (meso), it is **optically inactive**, regardless of the specific stereochemistry implied by \"(1s,3s,5s)\".\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other carbon is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule does not have any chiral centers and is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically active:\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n*   Optically inactive:\n    1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    4.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
