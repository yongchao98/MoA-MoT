    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **List the Species:** The cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n    *   Free Co(II) ion: `Co^2+`\n    *   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    *   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n3.  **Write the Total Cobalt Concentration Equation:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n4.  **Use the Stability Constants (β):** The overall stability constants relate the concentration of each complex to the free metal ion `[Co^2+]` and the free ligand `[SCN-]` concentrations:\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n5.  **Express `c(Co)` in terms of `[Co^2+]` and `[SCN-]`:** Substitute the expressions from step 4 into the equation from step 3:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n    Factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Percentage Calculation:** The percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` is:\n    `% [Co(SCN)2] = ([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) * 100`\n    Substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)2]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `% [Co(SCN)2] = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)) * 100`\n\n7.  **Simplify the Expression:** The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, leaving an expression that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`:\n    `% [Co(SCN)2] = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4) * 100`\n\n8.  **Approximate the Free Ligand Concentration:** The total concentration of thiocyanate is 0.1 M, and the total concentration of cobalt is 0.01 M. Since the ligand concentration is in 10-fold excess compared to the metal ion, we can make the common simplifying assumption that the concentration of the free ligand `[SCN-]` is approximately equal to its total concentration.\n    `[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Result:** Now, substitute the given values into the simplified formula.\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1` M\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate the terms in the denominator first:\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    Sum of the denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator is the term for the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex: `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 0.4`\n\n    Percentage = `(Numerator / Denominator) * 100 = (0.4 / 2.3646) * 100`\n\nI will now use Python code to perform the final calculation accurately.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nconc_scn = 0.1\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = beta2 * (conc_scn**2)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms for all species (including free Co2+, where beta0=1)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * conc_scn) + (beta2 * conc_scn**2) + (beta3 * conc_scn**3) + (beta4 * conc_scn**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction\nfraction = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = fraction * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```",
    "The calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is approximately 16.92%.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's double check the logic.\n- The fraction of a specific species `[MLn]` in a solution containing a metal `M` and a ligand `L` is given by the formula:\n  `α_n = [MLn] / C_M`\n  where `C_M` is the total concentration of the metal.\n- This fraction can be expressed in terms of the stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`:\n  `α_n = (β_n * [L]^n) / (1 + Σ(β_i * [L]^i))` for i from 1 to N, where N is the maximum coordination number.\n- In our case, we want the percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]`, so `n=2`.\n- The formula is: `% [Co(SCN)2] = α_2 * 100 = (β_2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β_1[SCN-] + β_2[SCN-]^2 + β_3[SCN-]^3 + β_4[SCN-]^4) * 100`\n- The assumption that `[SCN-]` ≈ `c(SCN-)_total` = 0.1 M is valid because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is significantly higher than the total metal concentration (0.01 M). The maximum amount of ligand that could be bound is `4 * 0.01 M = 0.04 M`, which is less than half of the total ligand. While this introduces a small error, it is a standard approximation in such problems. The calculation is therefore robust.\n\nThe Python code correctly implemented this formula.\n- Numerator: `beta2 * (conc_scn**2)` = `40 * 0.1^2` = `0.4`\n- Denominator: `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\n  `= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n- Percentage: `(0.4 / 2.3646) * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThe result from the code is 16.916...%, which rounds to 16.9%.\nThis matches option C.\n\nFinal Answer Confirmation:\n- All cobalt species are accounted for in the denominator.\n- The correct species (`[Co(SCN)2]`) is used in the numerator.\n- The stability constants and concentrations are used correctly.\n- The calculation is arithmetically sound.\n- The result matches one of the provided options.\n\nThe answer is C. ```\n[Co(SCN)2]\n```\nThe user wants to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Define the species and total concentration**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species in the solution:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n**2. Use stability constants to express concentrations**\n\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the free metal ion `[Co^2+]` and the free ligand `[SCN-]` concentrations:\n*   `[Co^2+]` (free ion, can be thought of as `β0 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^0` where `β0 = 1`)\n*   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n**3. Express the total concentration in terms of the free ion**\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 2 into the total concentration equation from step 1, we can factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**4. Formulate the percentage calculation**\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is given by:\n`% [Co(SCN)2] = ([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) * 100`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)2]` and `c(Co)`:\n`% [Co(SCN)2] = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)) * 100`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n`% [Co(SCN)2] = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4) * 100`\n\nThis resulting fraction is often denoted as the mole fraction `α2`.\n\n**5. Approximate the free ligand concentration and calculate**\n\nThe total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is 0.01 M, and the total thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]total` is 0.1 M. Since the ligand is in 10-fold excess, the amount of ligand that complexes with the metal is small compared to the total. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]` as the total ligand concentration.\n`[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values into the equation:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1`\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nWe will use a python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Define the given constants and concentrations\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nconc_scn = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# Calculate the term for the desired complex [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * (conc_scn**2)\n\n# Calculate the sum of all terms, representing the total cobalt species proportion\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * conc_scn) + (beta2 * conc_scn**2) + (beta3 * conc_scn**3) + (beta4 * conc_scn**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nfraction_co_scn2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_co_scn2 = fraction_co_scn2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_co_scn2)\n```\n>>>\n```\n[execution result]\n16.916180326482287\n```\n\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.
