    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.** This immediately suggests isotopic labeling. A very common example in chemistry is replacing Hydrogen (H, protium) with its heavier isotope, Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze potential gases (W):\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   N₂ (Nitrogen gas): The most common isotope, ¹⁴N, has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This also fits.\n        *   CO (Carbon Monoxide): Using common isotopes ¹²C (6p, 6n) and ¹⁶O (8p, 8n), a CO molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This also fits.\n        The D₂ option seems most promising because it aligns with Clue 1.\n    *   **Clue 4, 5, & 6: A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n        *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n        *   The proximity of B's melting point to that of D₂O is a very strong indicator that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   **Connecting the dots so far:** If B is D₂O, then G must be a deuterated compound that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide like M(OD)ₓ decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. If B is D₂O and W is D₂, it strongly reinforces the idea that Substance X is a deuterated compound.\n    *   **Clue 7 & 8: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.**\n        *   A keto acid has two functional groups containing oxygen: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   A reaction with X reduces the number of oxygen atoms to 2. This can happen if the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        *   The reduction of a carboxylic acid requires a very powerful reducing agent. The most common one in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a \"heavier isotope\" would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   Let's check this hypothesis: LiAlD₄ reduces a keto acid (R-CO-R'-COOH) to a diol (R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH). The final product has two oxygen atoms. This fits perfectly. NaBH₄ (and NaBD₄) is another common reducing agent, but it's not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids, so it's not a candidate.\n\n2.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   Let's assume **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a common reagent. (Checks out)\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope, D. (Checks out)\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid to give a product with 2 oxygens. (Checks out)\n    *   Now, let's check its reaction with \"liquid Y\". Given the production of D₂O, the most logical candidate for Y is D₂O itself.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4 D₂↑\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. As established, it has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Checks out)\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is insoluble in water/D₂O and would precipitate. (Checks out)\n    *   **Heating G:** When you heat G (Al(OD)₃), it decomposes: 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O.\n    *   **Substance B:** The substance released is D₂O, whose melting point is ~277 K. (Checks out)\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   To find the lightest and heaviest, we compare their atomic masses. For isotopes, we use the specific mass of that isotope, not the periodic table average.\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (²H or D) ≈ 2 u\n        *   Mass of Lithium (most stable isotope, ⁷Li) ≈ 7 u\n        *   Mass of Aluminum (most stable isotope, ²⁷Al) ≈ 27 u\n    *   The lightest element is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum (Al)**.\n    *   The problem asks for the *cumulative* mass, considering all instances. The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Total mass of the lightest element (Deuterium) = 4 × (mass of one D atom) ≈ 4 × 2 = 8 u.\n    *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 × (mass of one Al atom) ≈ 1 × 27 = 27 u.\n    *   Sum of these masses = 8 u + 27 u = 35 u.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35. This matches option C.\n\nTo confirm with more precise values:\n*   Mass of ²H (Deuterium) ≈ 2.014 u\n*   Mass of ²⁷Al ≈ 26.982 u\n*   Total mass from D = 4 * 2.014 u = 8.056 u\n*   Total mass from Al = 1 * 26.982 u = 26.982 u\n*   Sum = 8.056 + 26.982 = 35.038 u. This is extremely close to 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
