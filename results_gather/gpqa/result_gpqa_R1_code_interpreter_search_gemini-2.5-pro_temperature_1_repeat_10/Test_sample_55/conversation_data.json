    "Answering this question requires understanding the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions in a hydrogen atom and calculating the branching ratios for the decay cascade.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   Initial state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the $3s$ state).\n    *   Final state: $|n, l, m\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the $1s$ ground state).\n\n2.  **Analyze the decay path using selection rules:**\n    The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for emission, the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the selection rule. Therefore, the decay must occur via an intermediate state. The problem states it is a two-dipole transition process, which confirms a cascade decay.\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state(s):**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First transition:** $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$\n        *   Energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n        *   Selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, which implies $l'=1$. The intermediate state must be a $p$-state.\n        *   The lowest energy level with a $p$-state below $n=3$ is $n=2$. So, the intermediate state is a $2p$ state, i.e., $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, which implies $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Thus, the first step of the decay can proceed to any of the three states: $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, or $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$\n        *   This transition is from a $2p$ state to the $1s$ ground state.\n        *   Let's check the selection rules: $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ and $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$ must be in $\\{0, \\pm 1\\}$. This is true for all possible $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   This transition is the well-known Lyman-alpha transition. It is an allowed E1 transition.\n\n    So, there are three possible decay routes, all passing through one of the $2p$ sublevels. All the routes given in the options are physically possible. We must now determine the probability of a specific route.\n\n4.  **Calculate the transition probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The total probability of this cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n    $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** The $2p$ state ($|2,1,m'\\rangle$) can only decay to the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$) via an E1 transition. All other transitions are forbidden or require higher-order processes. Therefore, the probability of the second step, given the atom is in the intermediate state, is 1.\n        $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a specific sublevel $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. The transition rate $\\Gamma$ from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$.\n        $\\Gamma(i \\rightarrow f) \\propto |\\langle f | \\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    Let's calculate the relative rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. The interaction Hamiltonian, when averaged over all possible emission directions and polarizations of the photon, is isotropic. This suggests that there should be no preference for any of the final $m'$ states. Therefore, the transitions to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ should be equally probable.\n\n    To confirm this, we can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element for a tensor operator $T_q^{(k)}$ is given by:\n    $\\langle n'l'm' | T_q^{(k)} | nlm \\rangle = \\langle lm; kq | l'm' \\rangle \\langle n'l' || T^{(k)} || nl \\rangle$.\n    Here, the operator is the position vector $\\vec{r}$, which is a rank-1 tensor ($k=1$). The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and the final state is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. The transition rate is proportional to:\n    $|\\langle 2,1,m' | r_q | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2 \\cdot |\\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    For the transition to be non-zero, we need $m' = m+q = 0+q = q$.\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,q \\rangle = 1$ for all possible values of $q \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    The reduced matrix element $\\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle$ depends only on the principal and orbital quantum numbers ($n, l, n', l'$), not on the magnetic quantum numbers.\n\n    Therefore, the transition rates are equal for all three possible final states:\n    $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$.\n\n    The branching ratio for the decay into any one of these specific states is:\n    $B = \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\text{one state}}}{\\Gamma_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Gamma + \\Gamma + \\Gamma} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{3\\Gamma} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    So, the probability of the first step, e.g., $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)$, is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total probability and conclude:**\n    The total probability for the cascade through a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $P_{total} = (\\text{Branching Ratio for first step}) \\times (\\text{Probability of second step}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Now we check the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<The transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ and the corresponding probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nC>>>"
