    "This problem requires us to compare two astrophysical phenomena that alter a star's observed brightness: rotational modulation due to starspots and a transiting exoplanet. We need to find the size of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness drop as the starspots.\n\n### Step 1: Model the brightness variation due to starspots.\n\nThe observed flux (brightness) from a star is related to its temperature and radiating area. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (F ∝ T⁴).\n\n1.  **Star's Parameters:**\n    *   Effective temperature of the star, T_eff = 6000 K.\n    *   Temperature of the spots, T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n    *   The spots are on one hemisphere, with a filling factor f_spot = 20% = 0.20.\n\n2.  **Calculate Maximum and Minimum Flux:**\n    *   The star's brightness will be at its maximum (F_max) when the clean, unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk radiates at T_eff. We can normalize this flux to 1, so F_max is proportional to T_eff⁴.\n    *   The brightness will be at its minimum (F_min) when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. In this case, the visible disk is a mix: 80% of its area is at T_eff (6000 K), and 20% (the filling factor) is at T_spot (5000 K).\n    *   The flux from this spotted disk, relative to the unspotted disk, is a weighted average of the flux from the two components:\n        F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Signal:**\n    The amplitude of the photometric variation is the relative drop in flux from maximum to minimum:\n    Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\n    Substituting the expressions:\n    Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴\n    Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\n    Amplitude = (f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\n    Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴)\n    Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\n4.  **Plug in the values:**\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)\n    Amplitude = 0.20 * 0.51775\n    Amplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the starspots cause a periodic brightness variation with an amplitude of about 10.36%.\n\n### Step 2: Model the brightness drop due to a transiting exoplanet.\n\nWhen a planet passes in front of its star (a transit), it blocks a portion of the starlight, causing a dip in brightness.\n\n1.  **Transit Depth:**\n    The depth of this dip is simply the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\n    Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n    Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n    where R_pl is the planet's radius and R_star is the star's radius.\n\n### Step 3: Equate the two signals and solve for the planet's relative radius.\n\nWe want the transit depth to be equal to the amplitude of the spot modulation.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star) by taking the square root:\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nTo confirm with a precise calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Star and spot parameters\nTeff = 6000.0  # K\nT_spot = 5000.0 # K\nf_spot = 0.20   # filling factor\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the flux variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)**4)\namplitude_spots = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)**4)\n\n# For a transiting planet, the depth is (R_pl / R_star)^2\n# We set the depth equal to the spot amplitude and solve for R_pl / R_star\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude_spots\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude_spots)\nrelative_radius = np.sqrt(amplitude_spots)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_radius:.4f}\")\n```\n[execution result]:\n0.3218\n\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet would be approximately 0.32. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem is to determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet, relative to its host star's radius, that would produce the same change in brightness as observed from a star with a spotted hemisphere.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the brightness change due to starspots.**\n\nThe brightness (or more accurately, the flux `F`) emitted per unit area of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F = σT⁴`, where `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and `T` is the effective temperature. The total flux from a visible stellar disk is the integral of this quantity over the disk's area.\n\n*   **Star's Parameters:**\n    *   Effective temperature of the unspotted surface, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   Temperature of the dark spots, `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The filling factor of the spots on one hemisphere, `f_spot = 20% = 0.20`.\n\nThe star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing either its clean hemisphere or its spotted hemisphere.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`. Let's normalize this to `F_max = 1` (arbitrary units), which corresponds to a relative flux from a surface at `T_eff⁴`.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere's surface is a composite:\n    *   A fraction `(1 - f_spot) = 0.80` radiates at `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   A fraction `f_spot = 0.20` radiates at `T_spot = 5000 K`.\n\n    The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the two components. The relative flux is:\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in flux from maximum to minimum, calculated as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = f_spot * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625/1296)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225...)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * 0.51774...`\n    `Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the starspots cause a periodic brightness variation with an amplitude of approximately 10.36%.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the equivalent exoplanet size.**\n\nWhen a planet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip, assuming a uniform stellar disk, is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   `Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star`\n*   `Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n*   `Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nWhere `R_pl` is the planet's radius and `R_star` is the star's radius.\n\n### **Step 3: Equate the two signals and solve.**\n\nWe need to find the planet's relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`) that would produce a transit depth equal to the amplitude of the spot modulation.\n\n`Transit Depth = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root of this value:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nComparing our calculated value of ~0.32 to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated relative radius matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
