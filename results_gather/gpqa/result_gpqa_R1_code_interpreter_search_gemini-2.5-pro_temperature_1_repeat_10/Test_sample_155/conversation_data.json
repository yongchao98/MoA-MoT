    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagents:**\n    *   **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent opens the epoxide ring. This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, which proceeds via *anti*-attack of a water molecule.\n\n3.  **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening) results in an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** We can use the mnemonic \"TAME\" (Trans + Anti -> Meso).\n    *   Starting with a **T**rans alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **A**nti-addition (anti-dihydroxylation).\n    *   The product will be a **M**eso compound.\n    *   The product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. A meso compound is achiral but has chiral centers. In this case, the stereoisomer is (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which is identical to (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We can use the mnemonic \"CARS\" (Cis + Anti -> Racemic).\n    *   Starting with a **C**is alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **A**nti-addition (anti-dihydroxylation).\n    *   The product will be a **R**acemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The products of Reaction 2 are **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These are two distinct chiral molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). Let's call them **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **R**: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **S**: (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of both **R** and **S**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like M vs. R, and M vs. S) have different physical properties and will have different retention times. They will be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like R and S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will have the same retention time and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: Compound **M** (the meso-diol)\n        *   Peak 2: Compounds **R** and **S** co-eluting (the racemic pair)\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. It can differentiate between enantiomers by forming transient diastereomeric complexes that have different stabilities.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomers **R** and **S**.\n    *   It will also separate the diastereomer **M** from both **R** and **S**.\n    *   The problem states that the resolution is as high as theoretically possible, meaning all separable compounds will be resolved into distinct peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: Compound **M**\n        *   Peak 2: Compound **R**\n        *   Peak 3: Compound **S**\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
