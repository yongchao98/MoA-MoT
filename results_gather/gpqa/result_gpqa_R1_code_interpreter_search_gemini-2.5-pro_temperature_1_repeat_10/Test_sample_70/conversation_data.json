    "The user wants to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\nFor planets orbiting the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem states that the planets have the same albedo (A). Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is primarily dependent on the orbital distance `a`:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n\n**2. Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis can be rearranged to express `a` in terms of P:\n\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n**3. Combining the Formulas**\n\nNow, we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into our simplified equilibrium temperature proportionality:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(P^(2/3))\nT_eq ∝ 1 / (P^(2/3))^(1/2)\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculating the Temperature Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_4 / T_2). Using the relationship derived above:\n\nT_4 / T_2 = (1 / P_4^(1/3)) / (1 / P_2^(1/3))\nT_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n**5. Using the Given Orbital Period Ratios**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods: P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\nFrom this, we can determine the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\nP_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_4 / T_2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nLet's compute this value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of orbital periods P2/P4 is 2/3.5\nratio_p2_p4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3)\nratio_t4_t2 = ratio_p2_p4**(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"{ratio_t4_t2:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>0.83\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.75\nB) ~0.57\nC) ~0.69\nD) ~0.83\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants me to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Understanding Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its parent star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n\nIn this problem, all planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant. The problem also states that all planets have the same albedo (A). Therefore, the equilibrium temperature depends only on the semi-major axis `a`:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2) or T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n\n**2. Applying Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis `a` in terms of the orbital period `P`:\n\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n**3. Combining the Relationships**\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for `a` into our simplified equilibrium temperature proportionality:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(P^(2/3))\nT_eq ∝ 1 / (P^(2/3))^(1/2)\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis crucial result shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculating the Temperature Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_4 / T_2). Using the proportionality we just derived:\n\nT_4 / T_2 = (1 / P_4^(1/3)) / (1 / P_2^(1/3))\nT_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n**5. Using the Given Period Ratios**\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\nP_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute this period ratio into our temperature ratio equation and calculate the result.\n```python\n# The ratio of orbital periods P2/P4 is 2/3.5.\np2_over_p4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3).\nt4_over_t2 = p2_over_p4**(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"{t4_over_t2:.2f}\")\n```",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its distance from the star (a), assuming the star's properties and the planet's albedo are constant.\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\nP² ∝ a³\nThis can be rewritten as:\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nBy substituting the expression for 'a' into the temperature proportionality, we get:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 (T_4) and Planet_2 (T_2) can be expressed in terms of their orbital periods (P_4 and P_2) as:\nT_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nFrom the given orbital period ratios (1:2:2.5:3.5:5), we have:\nP_2 = 2 (in relative units)\nP_4 = 3.5 (in relative units)\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_4 / T_2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_4 / T_2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_4 / T_2 ≈ 0.83\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
