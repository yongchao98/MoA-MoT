    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The simplest and usually dominant form of radiation from a compact oscillating source is electric dipole radiation. The problem describes a spheroid with a symmetry axis along the z-axis, which is oscillating. This suggests that the charge displacement creates an oscillating electric dipole moment, **p**, oriented along the z-axis.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is given by the Larmor formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a factor that depends on the frequency and magnitude of the dipole moment but not on the angle `θ`.\n\n    The problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function `f`, so `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`.\n\n2.  **Maximum Power (A):**\n    The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when the `sin²(θ)` term is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1² = C`\n    So, the constant `C` is equal to the maximum power `A`.\n\n3.  **Power at θ = 30°:**\n    We can now find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` by substituting this angle into the formula:\n    `Power at 30° = C * sin²(30°)`\n    Since `A = C`, we have:\n    `Power at 30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    So, the power radiated at `30°` is `A/4`. The fraction of `A` radiated at this angle is **1/4**.\n\n4.  **Wavelength (λ) Dependence:**\n    Now, let's examine the factor `C` (which is `A`) to determine its dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The full expression for the power per unit solid angle is:\n    `dP/dΩ = (p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * ε₀ * c³) * sin²(θ)`\n    where `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment, `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πf_freq = 2π(c/λ)`.\n    From the formula for `dP/dΩ`, we can see that the power is proportional to `ω⁴`:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n    Substituting the relation for `ω` in terms of `λ`:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    This means the function `f(λ, θ)` which represents the power per unit solid angle, is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. A possible form for `f` is therefore proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This is the famous wavelength dependence also seen in Rayleigh scattering.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining our results:\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   A possible form of the function `f` shows a dependence of **λ⁻⁴** on wavelength.\n\n    Matching these results with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    B) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    C) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\n    The correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
