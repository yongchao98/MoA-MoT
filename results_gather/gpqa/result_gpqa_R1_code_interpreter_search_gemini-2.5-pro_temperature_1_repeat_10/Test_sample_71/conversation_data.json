    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial reaction to form Product 1.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This is a norbornadiene derivative, which can act as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. It has two equivalent double bonds.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n\nThe reaction of a 1,2-bis(dihalomethyl) compound with NaI is a standard method for generating a reactive diene, specifically an o-quinodimethane or an isomer. In this case, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene reacts with NaI to eliminate bromine and form 5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (let's call it Diene **D**). This is a highly reactive diene.\n\nThe reaction is a double Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative react with two equivalents of Diene **D**. The addition to a norbornene system occurs from the *exo* face.\n*   7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene + 2 **D** → Product **1**\nProduct **1** is a large, complex polycyclic molecule resulting from these two cycloadditions. It has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the C7 atom.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2.**\n\n*   Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\nThis is a standard condition for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether to an alcohol. The tert-butoxy group (-OC(CH₃)₃) at C7 is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   Product **1** (-O-tBu at C7) → Product **2** (-OH at C7)\nThe overall symmetry of the molecule is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3.**\n\n*   Product **2** is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\nThis is a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The secondary alcohol at C7 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   Product **2** (C7-OH) → Product **3** (C7=O)\nThe resulting molecule, Product **3**, now possesses a plane of symmetry (Cs) that contains the C1, C4, and C7 atoms.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the final product 4.**\n\n*   Product **3** is heated at 150°C.\nProduct **3** is a double Diels-Alder adduct. Heating such adducts often leads to a reversible reaction, the retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This reaction will break Product **3** back down into its constituent diene and dienophile components.\n*   Product **3** → Dienophile + 2 Diene **D**\n\nThe dienophile that is regenerated is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one. This molecule is known to be thermally unstable. Upon heating, it readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene.\n*   bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one → Benzene (C₆H₆) + CO\n\nThe other product is the diene, 5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (**D**). This molecule is also thermally unstable. The question asks for the \"final product 4,\" implying a single, major organic product. Benzene has only one type of hydrogen due to its high symmetry, which is not an option. The diene **D** itself is complex and does not match the options. Therefore, we must consider the fate of Diene **D** at 150°C.\n\nDiene **D** (C₈H₈) is known to rearrange to its more stable isomer, o-xylylene, also known as 1,2-bis(methylene)cyclohexa-3,5-diene. This isomerization is plausible under the reaction conditions. We will assume this isomer is the final product **4**.\n\n**Analysis of the structure of Product 4.**\n\n*   **Product 4:** o-xylylene (1,2-bis(methylene)cyclohexa-3,5-diene).\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is planar and possesses C₂ᵥ symmetry. The principal C₂ axis passes through the midpoints of the C1-C2 and C4-C5 bonds. A mirror plane contains this C₂ axis and is perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n\nLet's determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms (which corresponds to the number of signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum).\n1.  **Ring Protons:**\n    *   The symmetry relates the proton on C3 to the proton on C6. They are chemically equivalent. (1st signal, 2H)\n    *   The symmetry relates the proton on C4 to the proton on C5. They are chemically equivalent. (2nd signal, 2H)\n2.  **Methylene Protons (=CH₂):**\n    *   The two methylene groups (one on C1, one on C2) are equivalent due to the C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n    *   Within a single methylene group (e.g., at C1), the two protons are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because one is cis to the C6-H bond, while the other is cis to the C2=CH₂ group. Let's call them Hₐ and Hₑ.\n    *   The symmetry of the molecule makes Hₐ on C1 equivalent to Hₐ on C2. (3rd signal, 2H)\n    *   Similarly, Hₑ on C1 is equivalent to Hₑ on C2. (4th signal, 2H)\n\nIn total, there are **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in o-xylylene.\n\nTherefore, the final product 4 has 4 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
