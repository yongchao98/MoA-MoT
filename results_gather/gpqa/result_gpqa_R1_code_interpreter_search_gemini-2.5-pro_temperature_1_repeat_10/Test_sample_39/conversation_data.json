    "This is a common colloquialism used in chemistry labs, particularly in the context of purification and analysis. Let's break down why.\n\n*   **The Problem:** The chemist says things went \"not well,\" which implies a problem with an experiment. A crucial step in synthetic chemistry is purifying the desired product from any starting materials, byproducts, or solvents.\n*   **The Technique:** The most common method for both monitoring reactions and purifying compounds in an organic chemistry lab is **chromatography**. This includes Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) for quick analysis and column chromatography for large-scale separation.\n*   **How Chromatography Works:** Chromatography separates compounds in a mixture based on their differing physical properties. In the most common type, \"normal-phase\" chromatography, a polar stationary phase (like silica gel) is used with a less-polar mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents). Compounds are separated based on their **polarity**.\n    *   More polar compounds stick more strongly to the polar stationary phase and move slowly.\n    *   Less polar compounds stick less and are carried along more quickly by the mobile phase.\n*   **\"On Top of Each Other\":**\n    *   On a **TLC plate**, the separated compounds appear as distinct spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at the same rate up the plate, and their spots will overlap, appearing \"on top of each other.\" This indicates that this solvent system cannot separate them.\n    *   In **column chromatography**, different compounds are washed off the column at different times and collected in different flasks. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will wash off the column at the same time (co-elute), ending up in the same flasks. On a graph of the separation (a chromatogram), their peaks would be \"on top of each other.\"\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This is the direct cause of the problem. If polarities are too similar, chromatography fails to separate them, and they appear \"on top of each other.\" This is the most likely meaning.\n    *   **B) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other...** While molecules do interact, this phrase doesn't typically refer to intermolecular bonding. It describes the result of an analytical or purification technique.\n    *   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a property used for characterization, not separation. Two compounds could have identical optical rotations (if they are achiral or a racemic mixture) but be easily separable by polarity.\n    *   **D) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** This would be a problem for separation by **distillation**. While a valid purification issue, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more strongly associated with the visual output of chromatography (spots on a plate or peaks on a chromatogram).\n\nTherefore, the chemist is almost certainly referring to a failed chromatographic separation due to the similar polarities of the compounds in their mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>"
