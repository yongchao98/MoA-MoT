    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the particle decays. In a bubble chamber, a particle decay is \"observed\" or \"resolved\" if the particle travels a distinguishable distance before it decays. If the decay happens too close to the creation point (i.e., less than the detector's resolution), the tracks of the parent and daughter particles cannot be separated.\n\nTherefore, \"observing a decay\" means the particle's decay length, `x`, must be greater than the resolution, `δ`. The condition \"observe at least 30% of the decays\" translates to the probability of the decay length being greater than the resolution `δ` is at least 0.30.\nP(x > δ) ≥ 0.30\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". This is slightly ambiguous. A smaller resolution is always better (it allows observing more decays). A more precise phrasing would be the \"maximum resolution `δ` that allows observing at least 30% of the decays\". We will solve for the boundary condition:\nP(x > δ) = 0.30\n\n**2. Relativistic Decay Length**\n\nThe decay of particles is governed by an exponential probability distribution. The number of particles `N` remaining after traveling a distance `x` in the lab frame is given by:\nN(x) = N₀ * e^(-x/L)\nwhere `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `L` is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\nThe probability of a single particle traveling a distance greater than `δ` is:\nP(x > δ) = N(δ) / N₀ = e^(-δ/L)\n\nSetting this to our condition:\ne^(-δ/L) = 0.30\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n-δ/L = ln(0.30)\nδ = -L * ln(0.30)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the mean decay length `L`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)**\n\nThe mean decay length `L` in the lab frame depends on the particle's proper lifetime (`τ₀`), its velocity (`v`), and relativistic effects (time dilation).\n\nFirst, we find the Lorentz factor, `γ`, which describes the time dilation and energy/momentum relations. The total energy `E` of the particle is related to its rest mass `m₀` by:\nE = γ * m₀ * c²\nGiven:\nE = 27 GeV\nm₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n\nγ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 / 3.41\n\nThe mean lifetime in the lab frame is `τ = γ * τ₀`.\nThe velocity of the particle is `v = β * c`, where `β` is the speed relative to the speed of light `c`.\nThe mean decay length is `L = v * τ = β * c * γ * τ₀`.\n\nA more direct way to calculate `L` is using the particle's momentum `p`:\nL = (p / m₀) * τ₀\n\nWe can find the momentum `p` from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\nE² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n(pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)²\npc = sqrt(E² - (m₀c²)²)\n\nSo, L = (pc / (m₀c²)) * c * τ₀\nL = (sqrt(E² - (m₀c²)²) / m₀c²) * c * τ₀\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nNow we plug in the given values to find the numerical answer. We will use a Python script for precision.\n\n- E = 27 GeV\n- m₀ = 3.41 GeV/c²\n- τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n- c = 299792458 m/s (speed of light)\n- Desired fraction = 0.30\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Calculate `pc = sqrt(27² - 3.41²)`.\n2.  Calculate `L = (pc / 3.41) * c * τ₀`.\n3.  Calculate `δ = -L * ln(0.30)`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # GeV\nm0_c2 = 3.41  # GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # s\nc = 299792458  # m/s\nfraction = 0.3\n\n# Calculate the momentum-energy term pc in GeV\npc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m0_c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length L in meters\n# L = (p/m0) * tau0 = (pc / m0_c2) * c * tau0\nL = (pc / m0_c2) * c * tau0\n\n# Calculate the required resolution delta in meters\n# The fraction of particles that decay after distance delta is exp(-delta/L)\n# We set this fraction to 0.3\n# exp(-delta/L) = 0.3  =>  -delta/L = ln(0.3)  =>  delta = -L * ln(0.3)\ndelta = -L * np.log(fraction)\n\nprint(f\"{delta}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.268150428587118e-06\n\nThe calculated resolution is δ ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m.\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 2.08 × 10⁻¹ m\nB) 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m\nC) 2.08 × 10⁻³ m\nD) 2.08 × 10⁻⁹ m\n\nOur calculated value is 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m. Option B, 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m, is the closest in value and has the correct order of magnitude. The approximately 9% difference between the calculated value and the option might stem from a typo in the problem's given values (e.g., the energy `E` being 25 GeV instead of 27 GeV would yield a result of ~2.10 × 10⁻⁶ m). However, based on the information provided, 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m is the correct derivation, and 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m is the nearest choice.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the physics and calculations needed to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum resolution (`δ`) of a detector required to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle `X⁰`.\n\n*   **Observation Condition:** A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance `x` greater than the detector's resolution `δ` before it decays. If `x < δ`, the decay point is indistinguishable from the creation point.\n*   **Probability:** The requirement to observe \"at least 30% of the decays\" translates to a probability statement. The probability that a particle's decay length `x` is greater than the resolution `δ` must be at least 0.30.\n    *   `P(x > δ) ≥ 0.30`\n\n### 2. Physics of Particle Decay\n\nThe decay of unstable particles follows an exponential decay law. The number of particles `N(t)` remaining at time `t` in their own rest frame is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ₀)`, where `τ₀` is the proper lifetime.\n\nIn the laboratory frame (the bubble chamber), the particle is moving at a relativistic speed. This leads to two effects:\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (`τ`) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ₀`) by a factor of `γ` (the Lorentz factor): `τ = γ * τ₀`.\n*   **Length Contraction (not directly used here, but related):** The mean distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying, known as the mean decay length (`L`), is given by `L = v * τ`, where `v` is the particle's velocity in the lab frame.\n\nThe probability of a particle traveling a distance `x` before decaying is also described by an exponential law:\n`P(decay length > x) = exp(-x/L)`\n\nSo, our condition becomes:\n`exp(-δ/L) ≥ 0.30`\n\nTo find the boundary condition for the resolution, we set the probability equal to 0.30:\n`exp(-δ/L) = 0.30`\n\nSolving for `δ`:\n` -δ/L = ln(0.30)`\n` δ = -L * ln(0.30)`\n\nOur main task is to calculate the mean decay length `L`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Mean Decay Length (L)\n\nThe mean decay length is `L = v * τ = v * γ * τ₀`. We can calculate `v` and `γ` from the given energy and mass.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (`γ`)**:\n    The total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass energy `m₀c²` by `E = γ * m₀c²`.\n    *   `E = 27 GeV`\n    *   `m₀c² = 3.41 GeV`\n    *   `γ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918`\n\n2.  **Calculate the particle's velocity (`v`)**:\n    The Lorentz factor is also defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. We can solve for `v`.\n    Alternatively, and more directly, we can use the relativistic momentum `p`. The relationship between energy and momentum is `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`.\n    The mean decay length can also be expressed as `L = (p/m₀) * τ₀ = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀`. This avoids calculating `v` explicitly.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Momentum (`pc`)**:\n    *   `(pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)²`\n    *   `(pc)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 (GeV)²`\n    *   `pc = sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.78 GeV`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (`L`)**:\n    *   `L = (pc / m₀c²) * c * τ₀`\n    *   `L = (26.78 / 3.41) * (2.9979 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)`\n    *   `L ≈ 7.854 * (2.3983 × 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.884 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Resolution (δ)\n\nNow we can calculate the required resolution `δ`.\n*   `δ = -L * ln(0.30)`\n*   `ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204`\n*   `δ ≈ -(1.884 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)`\n*   `δ ≈ 2.268 × 10⁻⁶ m`\n\n### 5. Final Answer Selection\n\nThe calculated value for the resolution is `δ ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) 2.08 × 10⁻¹ m\nB) 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m\nC) 2.08 × 10⁻³ m\nD) 2.08 × 10⁻⁹ m\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option B. The small discrepancy (about 9%) is likely due to a minor inconsistency between the values given in the problem statement and the values used to generate the options. Based on the provided data, `2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m` is the correct result, and `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m` is the nearest choice.\n\nThe condition is `δ ≤ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`. A resolution of `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m` satisfies this condition, as it is smaller than the maximum allowed resolution.\n\n<<<B>>>"
