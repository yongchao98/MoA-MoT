    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where 'n' is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nThe molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 18.998 g/mol. Let M(Y) be the molar mass of element Y.\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = [n * M(F)] / [M(Y) + n * M(F)]\n\nWe are given ɷF = 31.96% = 0.3196.\n0.3196 = [n * 18.998] / [M(Y) + n * 18.998]\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 18.998 = n * 18.998\n0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 18.998 * (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 18.998 * 0.6804\nM(Y) = n * (18.998 * 0.6804 / 0.3196)\nM(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\nWe need to find an element Y and an integer n that satisfy this relationship. We can test integer values for n:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ar).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Antimony, Sb).\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Terbium, Tb).\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Mercury, Hg).\n*   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Plutonium, Pu).\n\nLet's test the most promising candidates by calculating the precise mass percentage of fluorine.\n*   **For Y=Sb (Antimony, M=121.76 g/mol) and n=3 (SbF₃):**\n    ɷF = (3 * 18.998) / (121.76 + 3 * 18.998) = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 31.88%. This is very close to 31.96%.\n*   **For Y=Pu (Plutonium, M≈244 g/mol) and n=6 (PuF₆):**\n    ɷF = (6 * 18.998) / (244 + 6 * 18.998) = 113.988 / 357.988 ≈ 31.84%. This is also very close.\n\n**Step 2: Use other chemical clues to distinguish between candidates.**\n\nLet's evaluate the Antimony (Sb) hypothesis, as it's a more common element in this context than Plutonium.\n*   **Element Y = Sb (Antimony)**\n*   **A2 = SbF₃** (Antimony trifluoride). ɷF = 31.88%, which is a good fit.\n*   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** For Antimony, SbF₃ and SbF₅ are very well known. Mixed-valence compounds like Sb₂F₁₁⁻ (in salts) and polymeric structures exist, and other fluorides have been reported under specific conditions. It is plausible that five compounds are considered \"known\".\n*   **\"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine.\"** The reaction is A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. This means A1 must have a higher fluorine content than SbF₃. The most likely candidate for A1 is **SbF₅** (Antimony pentafluoride). The decomposition would be SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂. This is a known equilibrium, especially at higher temperatures. The problem stating it decomposes at 293K (20°C) implies this equilibrium favors SbF₃ at room temperature, which is reasonable.\n*   **\"A1 (SbF₅) is a bright-red substance.\"** Solid SbF₅ is typically described as colorless, but impurities (like traces of bromine if used in preparation) can give it a yellow or brown color. \"Bright-red\" is a slight discrepancy, but chemical descriptions can vary. However, SbF₅ is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent.\n*   **\"A1 (SbF₅) oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"** SbF₅ reacts with Xenon to form compounds like XeF₂·SbF₅ and XeF₂·2SbF₅. This is a perfect match.\n*   **\"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Sb) with fluorine.\"** Sb + F₂ can produce SbF₃ or SbF₅ depending on conditions. So, A3 could be SbF₃ or SbF₅.\n*   **\"A3 can also interact with xenon.\"** If A3 is SbF₅, this is consistent. If A3 is SbF₃, it does not react with Xenon. So, **A3 is also SbF₅**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and A5.**\n\n*   **\"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** The reaction is Sb + A4 → A5. A4 is a \"colorless concentrated solution\".\n*   This points towards fluoroantimonic acid, H[SbF₆], which is a superacid. It is formed by reacting SbF₅ with HF.\n    HF + SbF₅ → H[SbF₆]\n    So, **A4 is H[SbF₆]**.\n*   The reaction becomes: Sb + H[SbF₆] → A5. This is a reaction in a highly acidic, fluorinating medium. It's likely a redox reaction where Sb⁰ is oxidized. A possible reaction is the formation of a mixed-valence antimony compound.\n*   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"** A plausible product for A5 is the salt of the [Sb₃F₁₄]⁻ anion, with H⁺ as the cation: H[Sb₃F₁₄]. This compound is known to exist.\n    The overall reaction to form A5 would be: 2 Sb + H[SbF₆] + 11 HF → H[Sb₃F₁₄] + 6 H₂ (unlikely) or perhaps involving SbF₅ from the solution. A more plausible reaction involves the SbF₅ used to make the acid:\n    2 Sb + 3 SbF₅ → 5 SbF₃. This is a known comproportionation reaction. If the solution is H[SbF₆], the reaction might be more complex, but the idea of Sb⁰ reducing Sb(V) is sound. A5 could be related to SbF₃ or a complex fluoroantimonate(III). Let's assume A5 is a complex that decomposes in water. For example, fluoroantimonates(III) hydrolyze.\n\nThe identification of **A4 as fluoroantimonic acid, H[SbF₆]**, is the most chemically sound conclusion based on the clues.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\n*   **A4 = H[SbF₆]**\n*   Molar Mass (H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass (Sb) ≈ 121.76 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass (F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n\nM(H[SbF₆]) = 1.008 + 121.76 + 6 * 18.998\nM(H[SbF₆]) = 1.008 + 121.76 + 113.988\nM(H[SbF₆]) = 236.756 g/mol\n\n**Step 5: Match the calculated molecular weight to the given ranges.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 236.756 g/mol. This value falls within the range:\nB) 220-240\n\n<<<B>>>"
