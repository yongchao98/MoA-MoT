    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We need to find the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands: Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV).\n    *   A hypothetical event occurs: the pp-III branch of the solar fusion process stops.\n    *   The problem states that \"all other reactions remained as they were.\"\n    *   The event happened ~8.5 minutes ago, meaning the consequences are observable on Earth now.\n\n2.  **Identify Solar Neutrino Sources by Energy:**\n    The Sun produces neutrinos primarily through the proton-proton (pp) chain and, to a lesser extent, the CNO cycle. We need to identify which of these reactions produce neutrinos in our target energy bands.\n\n    *   **pp-I chain:**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos: Continuous spectrum up to 420 keV. **(Not in our bands)**\n        *   `pep` neutrinos: Monoenergetic line at 1440 keV (1.44 MeV). **(Not in our bands)**\n    *   **pp-II chain:**\n        *   `7Be` neutrinos: Two monoenergetic lines, a strong one at 861 keV (90% of the time) and a weaker one at 383 keV (10%). The **861 keV line is in Band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n    *   **pp-III chain:**\n        *   `8B` (Boron-8) neutrinos: Continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. These neutrinos **contribute to both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n    *   **CNO cycle:**\n        *   `13N` and `15O` neutrinos: Continuous spectra with maximum energies of 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. These neutrinos also **contribute to both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Hypothetical Condition:**\n    The problem states that the **pp-III branch stops**. This means the flux of `8B` neutrinos becomes zero.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate Neutrino Sources in Each Band:**\n    With the `8B` neutrinos gone, let's see what sources are left for each band.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   The `8B` neutrino flux is now zero.\n        *   No other pp-chain reactions contribute to this band.\n        *   The only remaining source is the continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle**.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   The `8B` neutrino flux is now zero.\n        *   The strong **`7Be` line at 861 keV** is still present, as it comes from the pp-II branch, which \"remained as it was.\"\n        *   The continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle** also contributes to this band.\n\n5.  **Compare the Magnitude of the Fluxes:**\n    Now we need to compare the total flux in each band.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (Numerator):** This is the integrated flux from the CNO cycle over a 100 keV window. The CNO cycle accounts for only about 1% of the Sun's energy, and its neutrino flux is continuous (spread out over a wide energy range). Therefore, the flux in this narrow band is **very small**.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (Denominator):** This consists of two parts: the `7Be` line flux and the CNO continuous flux.\n        *   The `7Be` line at 861 keV is one of the most intense sources of solar neutrinos. Its flux is highly concentrated at this single energy.\n        *   The CNO flux in this band is, like in Band 1, very small.\n        *   Therefore, the total flux in Band 2 is **overwhelmingly dominated by the `7Be` line flux**. The contribution from CNO is negligible in comparison.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Approximate Ratio:**\n    The ratio is:\n    Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) ≈ (Flux from CNO) / (Flux from `7Be` line)\n\n    Let's put in some approximate numbers to see the scale:\n    *   The total flux of the 861 keV `7Be` line is approximately **4.5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s**.\n    *   The flux density of CNO neutrinos in this energy region is around 10⁵ neutrinos/cm²/s/MeV. To get the flux in our 100 keV (0.1 MeV) band, we multiply by the bandwidth: 10⁵ * 0.1 = **10⁴ neutrinos/cm²/s**.\n\n    So the ratio is approximately:\n    Ratio ≈ 10⁴ / (4.5 x 10⁹) ≈ 2.2 x 10⁻⁶\n\n7.  **Select the Best Answer:**\n    Our calculated ratio is a very small number (~10⁻⁶). Now let's look at the options:\n    A) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n    B) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n    C) 1\n    D) 10\n\n    The calculated value is not exactly one of the options. However, the problem asks for an *approximate* ratio. The result shows that the flux in Band 1 is virtually zero compared to the flux in Band 2. In many simplified textbook treatments, the CNO cycle's contribution is considered negligible. If we were to ignore the CNO flux, the flux in Band 1 would be exactly zero, making the ratio zero.\n\n    Among the given choices, **0.01 (10⁻²)** is the smallest value and is the only one that represents a very small, almost negligible ratio. It correctly captures the physics that the denominator is dominated by a massive line flux while the numerator contains only a tiny continuum flux.\n\n<<<A>>>"
