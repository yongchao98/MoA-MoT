    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position 1: an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   At position 3: a bromine atom (-Br).\n*   At position 5: a nitro group (-NO2).\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing groups on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern is a key clue. To achieve this pattern with high yield, it's most efficient to have two *meta*-directing groups on the ring before introducing the third substituent. Both existing groups would then direct the new group to the same position.\n\nLet's try to build a logical sequence based on this principle:\n\n*   **Step 1: Introduce a *meta*-director.** We can start with either Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the -COCH3 group or nitration to add the -NO2 group. Friedel-Crafts acylation on nitrobenzene is very difficult, so it's better to do the acylation first.\n    *   **Reaction 1 (Acylation):** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is now on the ring. It is a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Step 2: Introduce the second *meta*-director.** The other *meta*-director we need is the nitro group.\n    *   **Reaction 2 (Nitration):** Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group at position 1 directs the incoming nitro group to position 3 (*meta*). This works well.\n\n*   **Step 3: Introduce the final group.** Now we have acetophenone with a -COCH3 group at position 1 and a -NO2 group at position 3. Both are *meta*-directors. We need to add a bromine atom.\n    *   -COCH3 (at C1) directs to C5.\n    *   -NO2 (at C3) directs to C5.\n    *   Since both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the same position (C5), this reaction will have high regioselectivity.\n    *   **Reaction 3 (Bromination):** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   Although the ring is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, making the reaction slow, the directing effects are aligned, leading to a high yield of the desired isomer.\n\nThis logical three-step synthesis is: **Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's check which of the given options matches our logical synthesis, or comes closest to it. The provided options are complex, many involving reduction of a nitro group and subsequent diazotization/deamination (Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2), which is a roundabout way to remove a group. Such complexity is usually only necessary if a more direct route fails badly.\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with Nitration, then reduction to aniline, then tries Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This fails because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired reaction.\n\n*   **Option B:** The sequence of reaction types is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration → ...**.\n    1.  Benzene --(acylation)--> Acetophenone. (Good start)\n    2.  Acetophenone --(bromination)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone. (The acetyl group directs Br *meta*. This step works).\n    3.  3-Bromoacetophenone --(nitration)--> Product. This is the critical step. We have a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br). Their directing effects conflict. The -Br group directs to positions 4 and 6, while the -COCH3 group directs to position 5. The activating (ortho,para-directing) effect of the halogen usually dominates in these cases, leading to nitration at positions 4 and 6. The desired 5-nitro product would be a minor byproduct. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The subsequent steps are irrelevant as the key step fails to produce the correct intermediate in high yield.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with Bromination, then Nitration. This produces 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major) and 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (minor). The next step is Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings like nitro-halo-benzenes.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is problematic as written in most interpretations. For instance, one reading has the sequence Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzene (via deamination), which is circular and pointless. Another interpretation has a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which fails due to the strongly deactivating nitro group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the provided options contain significant chemical flaws:\n*   A, C, and D contain steps that are known to fail under standard conditions (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on strongly deactivated rings).\n*   B describes a sequence of reactions that are all possible, but a key step (nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone) has poor regioselectivity for the desired product, contradicting the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question where one answer must be correct, it's possible there is an error in the question itself. The most logical and effective synthesis is Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. Option B follows the sequence Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. It is the only option that starts with the correct first step and attempts to add the correct groups via electrophilic substitution, albeit in the wrong order for high yield. Given the catastrophic failures in the other options (reactions that do not proceed at all), Option B, despite its own flaw regarding yield, might be considered the \"best\" or intended answer, assuming a typo in the order of steps ii and iii. If we swap steps ii and iii in option B, we get the correct synthesis. No other option can be fixed so simply to yield a correct pathway.\n\nLet's re-examine Option B's steps: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2. Steps iv-vii seem extraneous and nonsensical after the target molecule would have been formed (in low yield) at step iii. This points to a poorly constructed question. However, if forced to choose, B's initial sequence of adding the three required functionalities is the most plausible starting point compared to the definite failures in other options.\n\nGiven the options, there appears to be an error in the question. However, if we must choose the most plausible sequence despite its flaws, B is the only one where the sequence of additions is conceptually close to a viable route, differing only by the order of the last two substitutions.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in option B and the correct sequence is i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Br2/FeBr3. This corrected sequence is the most efficient and logical route. Therefore, B is the most likely intended answer, despite being written with an error.\n\n<<<B>>>"
