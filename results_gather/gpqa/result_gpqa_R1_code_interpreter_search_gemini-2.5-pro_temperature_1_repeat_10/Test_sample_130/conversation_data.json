    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm. This indicates all its protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The anhydride has two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum at 137 ppm (alkene region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region). This indicates two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   The simplest structure fitting this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid).\n        *   **Structure:** A five-membered ring with two carbonyls and a C=C double bond.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** It has two equivalent vinyl protons, which would give a singlet. A chemical shift of 7 ppm is reasonable for protons on a double bond that is part of a conjugated, electron-withdrawing system.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** It has two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, leading to two signals. The given chemical shifts (137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic for these carbon types.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Structure:** It's a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds between C1-C2 and C3-C4. A methyl group is attached to each of these four carbons. The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₄.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   **Products:** The Diels-Alder reaction can result in two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the kinetic product and thus the **major product**, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamic product and typically the **minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n    *   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative: **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and Structure of the Products**\n\n*   Let's define the stereochemistry for this system. The *endo* adduct is the one where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the methylene bridge (C7). In this conformation, the two protons on the anhydride part (Hₐ) are pointing towards the C=C double bond.\n*   The *exo* adduct is the one where the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the methylene bridge (C7). In this conformation, the two protons on the anhydride part (Hₐ) are pointing away from the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The protons Hₐ are directed towards the C=C bond, which bears the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ).\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The protons Hₐ are directed away from the C=C bond and the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ).\n\n**4. Analyze the NMR Spectra and the NOESY Cross-Peak**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy):** This technique reveals which protons are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals means the corresponding protons are in close proximity.\n*   **The Key Information:** A cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   Based on our structural analysis in Step 3, the distance between the anhydride protons (Hₐ) and the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ) is short in the *endo* (major) product and long in the *exo* (minor) product. Therefore, the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum must be between **Hₐ** and **Meᵥ**.\n\n**5. Assign the NMR Signals**\n\nNow we need to assign the signals described in the options to the specific protons in the molecule. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Signal Types and Integrals:**\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls (Meᵥ):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Signal: **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bh):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. Signal: **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (Hₐ):** Two equivalent protons where the anhydride ring is fused. Signal: **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons (H_b):** Two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge. They would likely give two 1H signals, coupled to each other (e.g., two doublets or an AB quartet). The \"1H doublet\" in the options likely refers to one of these.\n\n*   **Chemical Shift (δ) Assignment:**\n    *   Vinylic methyls are deshielded compared to saturated alkyl methyls. A reasonable shift is **~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Bridgehead methyls are on saturated carbons. A reasonable shift is **~1 ppm**.\n    *   Anhydride protons (Hₐ) are α to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. They will be significantly deshielded. A reasonable shift is **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Bridge protons (H_b) are in a saturated, bicyclic environment. A reasonable shift is **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak unique to the major product connects the vinylic methyl protons (Meᵥ) and the anhydride protons (Hₐ).\n*   Our assignment for these signals is:\n    *   **Meᵥ:** 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   **Hₐ:** 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   This corresponds to the pair of resonances described in option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) Me_bh (~1 ppm) and H_b (~1.5 ppm): This distance should be similar in both isomers.\n*   B) H_b (~1.5 ppm) and Hₐ (~3.5 ppm): The distance between these depends on which bridge proton (syn or anti) and which isomer (endo or exo) is considered. It's not as clear-cut as the Hₐ-Meᵥ interaction for differentiating the isomers.\n*   C) Me_bh (~1 ppm) and Meᵥ (~1.7 ppm): These are on adjacent carbons, and their distance should be short and similar in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly identifies a pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) isomer and far in the minor (*exo*) isomer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
