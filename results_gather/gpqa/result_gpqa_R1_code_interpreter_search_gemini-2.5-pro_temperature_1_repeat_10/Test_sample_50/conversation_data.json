    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V = 0`).\n*   A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. We assume `d > R`.\n*   The presence of the charge `q` induces an opposite charge on the surface of the conducting sphere.\n*   We need to find the total potential energy of this system (the charge `q` plus the induced charge on the sphere).\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is most easily solved using the \"method of images.\" The basic idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, equivalent \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `d'` inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r = R`) is zero.\n\nThe established results from the method of images for this scenario are:\n\n*   **Image Charge (q'):** The magnitude and sign of the image charge are given by:\n    `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    The image charge has the opposite sign to the original charge.\n\n*   **Image Position (d'):** The image charge is located along the same line as the original charge `q` and the center of the sphere, at a distance `d'` from the center:\n    `d' = R^2 / d`\n    Since `d > R`, `d'` will be less than `R`, so the image charge is correctly located inside the sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of this configuration.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force (Work Done)**\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is equal to the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n\n`U = -W_field = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) ⋅ dx`\n\nWhere `F(x)` is the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center. Using the method of images, this force is simply the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `x' = R²/x`.\n\n*   Force at distance x: `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - x'(x))^2`\n*   Substitute `q'(x) = -qR/x` and `x' = R²/x`:\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)² = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n*   The potential energy is the integral:\n    `U = - ∫[∞ to d] [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx = k * q² * R ∫[∞ to d] x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n*   To solve the integral, use the substitution `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    `∫ x / (x² - R²)² dx = ∫ (1/2) * (1/u²) du = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n*   Now, evaluate the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ] from ∞ to d`\n    `U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / ∞) ]`\n    `U = - k * q² * R / (2(d² - R²))`\n\n**Method 2: Using Potential (Simpler)**\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\nIn our case, the system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere.\n\n`U = (1/2) * [ q * V_at_q + ∫ σ * V_on_sphere dS ]`\n\n*   `V_on_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere, which is zero because it is grounded. So the integral term is zero.\n*   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   Using the method of images, this potential is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n*   Calculate the potential from the image charge `q'` at the position `d`:\n    *   The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `d'`) is `d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   The potential `V_at_q` is `k * q' / (d - d')`.\n    *   `V_at_q = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d] = -k * qR / (d² - R²)`.\n\n*   Now substitute this back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result:\n\n`U = - (1/2) * kq² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThis matches option A. The energy is negative, which is expected because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere.\n\n<<<A>>>"
