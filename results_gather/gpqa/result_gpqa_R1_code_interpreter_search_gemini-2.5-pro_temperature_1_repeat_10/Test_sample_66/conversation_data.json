    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is `l=1`. So, `l1 = 1` and `l2 = 1`. The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=2`, and the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum has the quantum number `m = -1`.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, is performed. These operators have eigenvalues `m1*ħ` and `m2*ħ`, respectively. The basis states for this measurement are the uncoupled states, represented by `|l1, l2, m1, m2>`.\n\n3.  **Identify the target outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L_1z` as `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L_2z` as `-ħ`.\n    *   `L_1z = -ħ` corresponds to the quantum number `m1 = -1`.\n    *   `L_2z = -ħ` corresponds to the quantum number `m2 = -1`.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state `|l1, l2, m1, m2> = |1, 1, -1, -1>`.\n\n4.  **Relate the coupled and uncoupled bases:** The coupled state `|l, m>` can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|m1, m2>`. This relationship is governed by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The expansion is:\n    `|l1, l2, l, m> = Σ_{m1, m2} <l1, m1, l2, m2 | l, m> |l1, l2, m1, m2>`\n    where `<l1, m1, l2, m2 | l, m>` is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n5.  **Apply the selection rule for m-quantum numbers:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component quantum number `m` must be the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers `m1` and `m2`.\n    `m = m1 + m2`\n    This means the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l1, m1, l2, m2 | l, m>` is non-zero only if this condition is met.\n\n6.  **Check the selection rule for the given problem:**\n    *   From the initial coupled state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, we have `m = -1`.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome `|1, 1, -1, -1>`, we have `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n    *   Let's check if the selection rule `m = m1 + m2` is satisfied:\n        `m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n    *   We compare this sum to the `m` of the initial state: `-2 ≠ -1`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the probability:** The probability of measuring the state `|1, 1, -1, -1>` when the system is in the state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state. This is equivalent to the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    `P(m1=-1, m2=-1) = |<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2`\n    Since the selection rule `m = m1 + m2` is not satisfied (`-1 ≠ -2`), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>` is exactly zero.\n    Therefore, the probability is `|0|^2 = 0`.\n\nTo be certain, we can write a short python script to compute the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# Define the quantum numbers from the problem statement\n# Initial state |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Measured outcome state |l1, l2, m1, m2> = |1, 1, -1, -1>\nm1 = -1\nm2 = -1\n\n# The probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l1, m1, l2, m2 | l, m>\n# which is represented by CG(l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m) in sympy.\ncoefficient = CG(l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m)\nvalue = coefficient.doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient.\nprobability = abs(value)**2\n\nprint(f\"The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1> is {value}.\")\nprint(f\"The required probability is {probability}.\")\n```\n```output\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1> is 0.\nThe required probability is 0.\n```\nThe python code confirms that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0, and therefore the probability is 0. The reason is that the sum of the measured z-components (`m1+m2 = -2`) does not equal the initial total z-component (`m=-1`).\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the probability of finding the system in a specific uncoupled state, given its initial coupled state.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system is described by the coupled angular momentum state `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. This means:\n    *   `l1 = 1` (electron 1 is in a p orbital)\n    *   `l2 = 1` (electron 2 is in a p orbital)\n    *   `l = 2` (the total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n    *   `m = -1` (the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum, `Lz`). The eigenvalue of `Lz` is `mħ = -ħ`.\n\n2.  **Measurement**: A measurement is performed on the z-components of the individual angular momenta, `L_1z` and `L_2z`.\n\n3.  **Desired Outcome**: We want to find the joint probability of getting:\n    *   `L_1z` eigenvalue = `-ħ`, which means the quantum number `m1 = -1`.\n    *   `L_2z` eigenvalue = `-ħ`, which means the quantum number `m2 = -1`.\n    This corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state `|l1, l2, m1, m2> = |1, 1, -1, -1>`.\n\n4.  **Connecting the States (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients)**: The probability of measuring the state `|m1, m2>` when the system is in the state `|l, m>` is given by the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    `P(m1, m2) = |<l1, m1, l2, m2 | l, m>|^2`\n\n5.  **Conservation of the z-component of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental rule in adding angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This means the quantum numbers must satisfy the relation:\n    `m = m1 + m2`\n    If this condition is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l1, m1, l2, m2 | l, m>` is zero, and the probability of that transition is also zero.\n\n6.  **Applying the Rule to the Problem**:\n    *   From the initial state, we have `m = -1`.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we have `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n    *   Let's check the sum: `m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   We compare this to the initial `m`: `-2 ≠ -1`.\n\nSince the condition `m = m1 + m2` is not satisfied, it is impossible to obtain the measurement outcome `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` from the initial state `m = -1`. The probability of such an event is zero.\n\nThe probability is given by `|<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2`. Because `-1 + (-1) ≠ -1`, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>` is 0. Therefore, the probability is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>"
