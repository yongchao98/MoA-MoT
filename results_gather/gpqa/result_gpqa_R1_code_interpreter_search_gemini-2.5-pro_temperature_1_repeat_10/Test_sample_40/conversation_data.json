    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame, denoted as **S**. The observer is in this frame.\n    *   Let the frame of the moving glass be the moving frame, denoted as **S'**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the moving frame S' (the glass) relative to the stationary frame S (the lab) is **v**. It is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   The velocity of the light beam as measured within its own medium (the glass) is the speed of light in that medium. The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since we are given that the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of the light beam in the rest frame of the glass (S') is **u' = 1/n**.\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame S. Let's call this velocity **u**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, when two velocities are in the same direction, they do not simply add up. Instead, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula for the resultant velocity `u` in frame S, given a velocity `u'` in frame S' which is moving at velocity `v` relative to S, is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    Now, we substitute the values we identified into this formula:\n    *   `u'` = `1/n`\n    *   `v` = `v`\n    *   `c` = `1`\n\n    This gives us:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Let's simplify the algebraic expression:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    B) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) 1\n\n    Our result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
