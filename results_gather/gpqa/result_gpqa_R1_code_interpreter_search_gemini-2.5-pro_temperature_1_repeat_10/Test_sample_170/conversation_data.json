    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the substituent already on the benzene ring directs the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) to certain positions.\n\n*   **Activating Groups (Ortho, Para-directors):** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive. They direct the incoming group to the *ortho* and *para* positions. Examples in our list are alkyl groups.\n    *   -CH3 (in substance 1)\n    *   -C2H5 (in substance 5)\n*   **Deactivating Groups (Meta-directors):** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming group to the *meta* position. The yield of the *para* isomer will be very low for these substances.\n    *   -COOC2H5 (in substance 2)\n    *   -NO2 (in substance 4)\n    *   -COOH (in substance 6)\n*   **Halogens (a special case):** Halogens are deactivating but are *ortho, para*-directors due to their lone pairs participating in resonance.\n    *   -Cl (in substance 3)\n\n**2. Separate the Substances into Two Groups**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can split the substances into two groups:\n\n*   **Group A (Low para-yield):** Meta-directors. These will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH\n*   **Group B (High para-yield):** Ortho, para-directors. These will have the highest yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) ะก6H5-CH3\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5\n\nThe final correct sequence will have all substances from Group A followed by all substances from Group B.\n\n**3. Rank the Substances within Group A (Low para-yield)**\n\nThese are all meta-directors, so the para yield is minimal. The order is determined by the specific electronic properties of the groups.\n*   **-NO2 (4):** A very strong deactivating group. It gives a minimal amount of the para product. Typical para yield is ~1%.\n*   **-COOH (6):** A strong deactivating group. The para yield is also very low, typically around 1-2%.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2):** A deactivating group, but experimental data shows it yields slightly more para product than -NO2 and -COOH, with a para yield of around 8%.\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Rank the Substances within Group B (High para-yield)**\n\nThese are all ortho, para-directors. The relative yield of the para-isomer compared to the ortho-isomer depends on both electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **-Cl (3):** Halogens, while deactivating, strongly favor the para position for substitution over the ortho position. The para-isomer is the major product by a large margin (often ~88% yield). This will have the highest para-yield in this group.\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The key difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulkiness hinders the electrophile from attacking the adjacent *ortho* positions, thus increasing the proportion of the product formed by attack at the less hindered *para* position. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) will give a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1).\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Ranked Groups**\n\nNow, we combine the two ranked groups to get the final order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n(Group A) < (Group B)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
