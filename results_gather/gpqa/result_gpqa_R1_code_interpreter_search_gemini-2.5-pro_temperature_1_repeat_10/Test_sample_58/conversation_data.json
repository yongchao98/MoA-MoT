    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so moles of H+ = 0.080 mol.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to yield two moles of hydroxide ions (OH-) for every mole of Ba(OH)2: Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with the acids. The reaction with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) occurs first and goes to completion.\n\n*   **Step 2a: Reaction between the strong acid and strong base.**\n    *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   H⁺ is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 mol of H⁺ will be neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.080 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Step 2b: Reaction between the weak acid and the remaining strong base.**\n    *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.050 mol of CH3COOH will be neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH⁻, making the solution basic.\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻.**\n\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Total Volume:**\n    *   V_total = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**4. Calculate the pOH and pH.**\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\nLet's use a Python script for a precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial moles\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_h_from_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_oh_from_baoh2 = 2 * (0.3 * 0.300)\n\n# Moles after reactions\ntotal_moles_acid = moles_ch3cooh + moles_h_from_hcl\nmoles_excess_oh = moles_oh_from_baoh2 - total_moles_acid\n\n# Final volume and concentration\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nfinal_conc_oh = moles_excess_oh / total_volume\n\n# pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(final_conc_oh)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=:.2f}\")\n```\n```output\npH=12.62\n```\n\nThe calculation confirms that the pH is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a neutralization reaction problem involving a strong acid (HCl), a weak acid (CH3COOH), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The key is to determine which species is in excess after all reactions have gone to completion.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of H+ and OH- ions.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.05 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.4 L = 0.08 mol HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely: moles of H+ = 0.08 mol\n\n*   **Total moles of acidic protons (from both strong and weak acids):**\n    *   Total moles H+ (available to react) = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH3COOH = 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles = 0.3 mol/L × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), moles of OH- = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n**2. Determine the excess reactant.**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will react with all available acidic protons.\n*   Moles of OH- = 0.18 mol\n*   Total moles of H+ = 0.13 mol\n\nSince the moles of OH- are greater than the total moles of H+, the base is in excess.\n\n*   **Moles of excess OH-** = Initial moles OH- - Total moles H+\n    *   Moles of excess OH- = 0.18 mol - 0.13 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH- ions.**\n\nThe final pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base.\n*   **Total volume of the solution:**\n    *   V_total = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Concentration of excess OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**4. Calculate pOH and pH.**\n\n*   **pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **pH:**\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14.00 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
