    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    The problem describes two different mean free paths measured under the same conditions of temperature, pressure, and volume, which means the number density `n` of the gas molecules is the same in both cases.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1 (λ1):** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. The moving particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules. The relevant collision cross-section is for a molecule-molecule collision, which we'll call `σ1`.\n        λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2 (λ2):** This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam. The moving particles are electrons, and the target particles are the gas molecules. The relevant collision cross-section is for an electron-molecule collision, which we'll call `σ2`.\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n\n3.  **Compare the Mean Free Paths:**\n    To compare λ1 and λ2, we can take their ratio:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ2)] / [1 / (n * σ1)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2\n\n    This equation shows that the relationship between λ1 and λ2 is determined by the inverse relationship of their respective collision cross-sections, `σ1` and `σ2`.\n    *   If `σ2 > σ1`, then `λ2 < λ1`.\n    *   If `σ2 < σ1`, then `λ2 > λ1`.\n    *   If `σ2 = σ1`, then `λ2 = λ1`.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    The core of the problem lies in understanding the difference between `σ1` and `σ2`.\n\n    *   **σ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collision Cross-Section):** This is the \"gas-kinetic\" cross-section. It describes the collision between two neutral gas molecules. This interaction is governed by very short-range forces (like van der Waals forces) and is closely related to the physical size of the molecules. It's often modeled as a \"billiard ball\" collision.\n\n    *   **σ2 (Electron-Molecule Collision Cross-Section):** This describes the interaction between a high-energy, negatively charged electron and a neutral gas molecule. The gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The incoming electron interacts with the molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron can be scattered by the electric field of the nucleus or the molecule's electron cloud. It can also lose energy and ionize or excite the molecule. Because the electromagnetic force is long-range, the electron can be significantly deflected (a \"collision\" event) even when passing the molecule at a distance much larger than its physical radius.\n\n5.  **Draw the Conclusion:**\n    The long-range electromagnetic interaction between an electron and a molecule results in a much larger effective target area than the short-range interaction between two neutral molecules. Therefore, the electron-molecule collision cross-section is significantly larger than the molecule-molecule collision cross-section.\n    σ2 > σ1\n\n    Since λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2, and σ1 / σ2 < 1, it follows that:\n    λ2 < λ1\n\n    The mean free path of the electrons with respect to the gas molecules is shorter than the mean free path of the gas molecules with respect to each other. Mike's observation of a different mean free path is physically correct, and the new mean free path `λ2` is smaller than `λ1`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation - Incorrect. The cross-sections are different.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect. This implies λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect. This also implies λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1 - Correct. This matches our physical reasoning.\n\n(Note: The factor of 1.22 in options B and C is likely a distractor, possibly borrowed from the Rayleigh criterion for resolution in optics and microscopy, and is not relevant to the comparison of these two types of mean free paths.)\n\n<<<D>>>"
