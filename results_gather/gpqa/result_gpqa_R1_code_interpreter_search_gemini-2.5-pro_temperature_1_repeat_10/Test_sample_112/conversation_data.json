    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this peak to be very broad, often overlapping with the C-H stretches.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is expected around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to determine the composition of a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Using the atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1, O≈16):\n    *   The fragment is [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Calculation: 12.01 (C) + 1.01 (H) + 2 * 16.00 (O) = 45.01.\n*   This fragment is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid, providing strong evidence for this functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Determining the Molecular Formula:**\n*   The combined data strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both an alkene and a carboxylic acid).\n*   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n*   We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H12O2 and B) C6H10O2.\n*   To distinguish between them, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n    *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) -> 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) -> 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the total required DoU is 1 + 1 = 2.\n*   Now let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula can only account for one double bond (e.g., the C=O in a saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid), but not the additional C=C alkene.\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has the correct degree of unsaturation to accommodate both the C=O of the carboxylic acid and the C=C of the alkene. An example structure would be hex-2-enoic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only molecular formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic data is C6H10O2.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_string):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a molecular formula.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    # Find all element-count pairs in the formula string\n    atoms = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula_string)\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each atom\n    counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'N': 0, 'X': 0}\n    for atom, count in atoms:\n        # If count is an empty string, it means the count is 1\n        num = int(count) if count else 1\n        if atom == 'C':\n            counts['C'] += num\n        elif atom == 'H':\n            counts['H'] += num\n        elif atom == 'N':\n            counts['N'] += num\n        elif atom in ['F', 'Cl', 'Br', 'I']:\n            counts['X'] += num\n            \n    # Apply the Degree of Unsaturation formula\n    # DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    dou = counts['C'] + 1 - (counts['H'] / 2) - (counts['X'] / 2) + (counts['N'] / 2)\n    return dou\n\n# The candidate formulas\nformulas = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H12O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H10O\"\n}\n\n# Print the analysis\nprint(\"Analysis of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):\")\nprint(\"The compound is an alkenoic acid, containing one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\")\nprint(\"This requires a total DoU of 2 (1 for C=O, 1 for C=C).\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nfor option, formula in formulas.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}): DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"Option B (C6H10O2) is the only formula with the required DoU of 2.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of an O-H bond stretch within a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at ~1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid functional group and an alkene functional group. A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and indicative fragment. Let's calculate its composition:\n        *   Carbon (C) = 12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O) = 16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H) = 1 amu\n        *   The fragment [COOH]⁺ has a mass of 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Based on the FTIR and Mass Spec data, the compound must be a carboxylic acid. This means its molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms (O2)**. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n    *   We are now left with A) C6H12O2 and B) C6H10O2.\n    *   The data also shows the presence of a C=C double bond (alkene). We can use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine which formula is correct. The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, it must have a **DoU of 2**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula can only account for one double bond (the C=O), but not the additional C=C.\n        *   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula correctly accounts for two degrees of unsaturation, fitting both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The only molecular formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence (carboxylic acid group, alkene group, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
