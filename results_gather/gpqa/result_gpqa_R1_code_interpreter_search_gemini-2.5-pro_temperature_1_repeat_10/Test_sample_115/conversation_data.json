    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify compound D.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of compound A shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).\n*   The integration ratio is 6H:4H, which simplifies to 3:2.\n*   A signal with integration 6H as a triplet suggests two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). The splitting pattern (triplet) is due to the 2 neighboring protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n*   A signal with integration 4H as a quartet suggests two equivalent methylene groups (-CH2-), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The splitting pattern (quartet) is due to the 3 neighboring protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4).\n*   This pattern of a 3H triplet and a 2H quartet is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). Since we have a 6H triplet and a 4H quartet, this indicates two equivalent ethyl groups.\n*   The chemical shifts (0.9 ppm and 1.3 ppm) are in the typical range for an alkane.\n*   The total number of protons is 6 + 4 = 10. The molecular formula corresponding to two ethyl groups is C4H10.\n*   The only C4H10 alkane that is symmetrical and would give two signals with a 6H:4H ratio is n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3). The two outer CH3 groups are equivalent (6H), and the two inner CH2 groups are equivalent (4H). Strictly, the CH2 signal would be a sextet due to splitting by both the adjacent CH3 (3H) and CH2 (2H) groups, but \"quartet\" is a plausible simplification in a problem statement.\n*   Therefore, **Compound A is n-butane**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation reaction.\n*   `CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3 + Br2 --(light/heat)-->`\n*   Bromination is selective and will preferentially occur at the more stable secondary carbon atom rather than the primary carbon atom.\n*   The major product is 2-bromobutane.\n*   Therefore, **Compound B is 2-bromobutane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction that proceeds via an E2 elimination mechanism.\n*   The base (OH-) will remove a proton from a carbon adjacent (beta) to the carbon bearing the bromine. There are two types of beta-protons in 2-bromobutane: on C1 and C3.\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, the major product is the more substituted (more stable) alkene.\n    *   Elimination of H from C1 gives but-1-ene (minor product).\n    *   Elimination of H from C3 gives but-2-ene (major product).\n*   The problem states that compound C has two geometrical isomers. But-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3) exists as *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene. But-1-ene does not have geometrical isomers.\n*   Therefore, **Compound C is but-2-ene**. The reaction uses the *cis*-isomer.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D via Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a diene and a dienophile.\n    *   **Diene**: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n    *   **Dienophile**: *cis*-but-2-ene.\n*   For the reaction to occur, the diene must be in the s-cis conformation.\n    *   The stereochemistry of the diene ((1E,3E)) means that in the s-cis conformation, the -OH group (at C1) and the -CH3 group (at C4) are on the \"outside\", and the hydrogen atoms at C1 and C4 are on the \"inside\".\n*   **Stereochemical Principles of the Diels-Alder Reaction:**\n    1.  **Conservation of Stereochemistry**: The relative stereochemistry of the dienophile and diene is retained in the product.\n        *   Since the dienophile is *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups will be *cis* to each other in the final cyclohexene ring product.\n        *   The \"outside\" groups of the diene (-OH and -CH3) will be *cis* to each other in the product.\n    2.  **The Endo Rule**: The reaction is kinetically controlled and favors the *endo* product. This means the substituents of the dienophile are oriented \"under\" the diene system in the transition state. In the final product, this places the dienophile's substituents (*cis*-methyl groups) on the opposite face of the ring relative to the \"outside\" groups of the diene (-OH and -CH3).\n\n*   **Constructing the Product (Compound D):**\n    *   The product is a 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n    *   Let's define the \"up\" face of the ring as the one where the \"outside\" groups of the diene end up. So, the -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4 are both **up** (wedge).\n    *   Because of the *endo* rule, the two methyl groups from the dienophile (at C5 and C6) will be on the opposite face, meaning they are both **down** (dash).\n\n*   **Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) Configuration:**\n    *   We have the following relative stereochemistry for the endo product: C1-OH (up), C4-CH3 (up), C5-CH3 (down), C6-CH3 (down).\n    *   Let's determine the absolute configuration based on this structure.\n    *   **At C1**: Priorities are OH > C2=C > C6 > H. H is down. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise. **C1 is S**.\n    *   **At C4**: Priorities are C3=C > C5 > CH3 > H. H is down. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise. **C4 is R**.\n    *   **At C5**: Priorities are C6 > C4 > CH3 > H (C6 is attached to C1 which has an O; C4 is attached to C3 of the C=C). H is up. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise. Since H is up, we reverse the assignment. **C5 is S**.\n    *   **At C6**: Priorities are C1 > C5 > CH3 > H (C1 is attached to an O). H is up. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise. Since H is up, we reverse the assignment. **C6 is R**.\n\n*   The predicted configuration for the major product (D) is **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
