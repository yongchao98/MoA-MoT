    "An elegant way to solve this problem is to consider the square of the Hamiltonian operator, $H^2$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\nLet's calculate $H^2$:\n$H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2$\n\nThe term $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2$ can be expanded as:\n$(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (\\sigma_x n_x + \\sigma_y n_y + \\sigma_z n_z)(\\sigma_x n_x + \\sigma_y n_y + \\sigma_z n_z)$\n$= \\sum_{i,j \\in \\{x,y,z\\}} n_i n_j \\sigma_i \\sigma_j$\n\nWe use the well-known identity for Pauli matrices:\n$\\sigma_i \\sigma_j = \\delta_{ij} I + i \\sum_{k} \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sigma_k$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix, and $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol.\n\nLet's expand the sum:\n$\\sum_{i,j} n_i n_j \\sigma_i \\sigma_j = \\sum_{i} n_i^2 \\sigma_i^2 + \\sum_{i \\neq j} n_i n_j \\sigma_i \\sigma_j$\n\nThe diagonal terms ($i=j$) are:\n$n_x^2 \\sigma_x^2 + n_y^2 \\sigma_y^2 + n_z^2 \\sigma_z^2$\nSince $\\sigma_x^2 = \\sigma_y^2 = \\sigma_z^2 = I$, this part becomes:\n$(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I$\n\nThe off-diagonal terms ($i \\neq j$) are:\n$n_x n_y (\\sigma_x \\sigma_y + \\sigma_y \\sigma_x) + n_x n_z (\\sigma_x \\sigma_z + \\sigma_z \\sigma_x) + n_y n_z (\\sigma_y \\sigma_z + \\sigma_z \\sigma_y)$\nThe Pauli matrices anti-commute, meaning $\\sigma_i \\sigma_j = -\\sigma_j \\sigma_i$ for $i \\neq j$. Thus, their anti-commutator is $\\{\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j\\} = \\sigma_i \\sigma_j + \\sigma_j \\sigma_i = 0$.\nSo, all the off-diagonal terms vanish.\n\nCombining the results, we have:\n$(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I$\n\nThe problem states that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, which means its magnitude is 1. Therefore, $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\nSo, $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (1)I = I$.\n\nNow, let's go back to $H^2$:\n$H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n\nIf $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$ corresponding to an eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$, then $H|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$.\nApplying $H$ again:\n$H^2|\\psi\\rangle = H(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda(H|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFrom our calculation of $H^2$, we also have:\n$H^2|\\psi\\rangle = (\\varepsilon^2 I)|\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nComparing the two expressions for $H^2|\\psi\\rangle$, we get:\n$\\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2|\\psi\\rangle$\nSince $|\\psi\\rangle$ is a non-zero vector, we must have:\n$\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the possible eigenvalues:\n$\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
