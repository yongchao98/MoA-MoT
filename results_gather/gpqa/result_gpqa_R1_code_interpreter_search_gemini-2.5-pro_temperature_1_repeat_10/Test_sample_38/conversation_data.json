A fundamental principle is that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space must be 1.

The wave function `ψ(x)` is a complex function of the form `ψ(x) = Re(x) + i * Im(x)`.

    "The user wants to find the value of the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function.\n\n**1. Understand the Wave Function and Probability**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the wave function, ψ(x), describes the state of a particle. The probability of finding that particle in a specific region of space is determined by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|².\n\nThe given wave function is a complex number:\nψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i\n\nThis has a real part, Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x), and an imaginary part, Im(ψ) = -0.5.\n\n**2. Calculate the Probability Density Function**\n\nThe probability density, |ψ(x)|², is calculated as Re(ψ)² + Im(ψ)²:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**3. Apply the Normalization Condition**\n\nA fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the total probability of finding the particle anywhere it can exist must be 1. This is called the normalization condition. The problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density function over this interval must equal 1.\n\n∫ [from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nSubstituting our expression for |ψ(x)|²:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n**4. Solve the Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the definite integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\nThe antiderivative is: a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x\n\nNow, we evaluate this from x=1 to x=3:\n= [ a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * (3) ] - [ a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * (1) ]\n= [ a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ] - [ a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ]\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25)\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c):\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\n**5. Solve for 'a'**\n\nNow we set the result of the integral equal to 1, as per the normalization condition:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n**6. Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe value was calculated using Python:\na ≈ 0.8493\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the calculated value of a ≈ 0.8493 with the given options:\nA) 1.1\nB) 0.35\nC) 0.85\nD) 0.6\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
