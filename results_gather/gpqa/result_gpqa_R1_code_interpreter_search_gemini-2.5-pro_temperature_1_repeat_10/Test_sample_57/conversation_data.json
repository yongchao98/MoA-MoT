    "The user wants to identify the physical theory from the given options that does not require regularization at high energies. Let's analyze each option.\n\n1.  **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** and **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: These are both Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). When calculating physical quantities in QFTs using perturbation theory (represented by Feynman diagrams), one often encounters integrals over momentum that diverge at high energies (ultraviolet divergences). Regularization is a necessary mathematical procedure to handle these infinities. After regularization, a process called renormalization is used to absorb these infinities into a redefinition of physical parameters (like mass and charge), yielding finite, predictive results. Therefore, both QED and QCD require regularization.\n\n2.  **Classical Electrodynamics**: This theory also faces a high-energy problem, specifically the \"self-energy\" of a point charge. If an electron is treated as a classical point particle, the energy stored in its own electric field is infinite because the field strength diverges as the distance to the charge approaches zero. This is a classical divergence that occurs at short distances (which corresponds to high energies). To get a finite result, one must introduce a cutoff, which is a form of regularization (e.g., assuming the electron has a small but non-zero radius).\n\n3.  **Superstring Theory**: String theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify gravity with the other fundamental forces. In contrast to QFTs, which describe interactions of point-like particles, string theory describes fundamental entities as one-dimensional \"strings\". A key theoretical feature and motivation for string theory is that the extended nature of these strings is believed to \"smear out\" interactions at very short distances. This smearing effect naturally tames the high-energy behavior that leads to divergences in QFTs. As a result, string theory is conjectured to be \"UV finite,\" meaning it does not suffer from ultraviolet divergences and therefore would not require the process of regularization.\n\n**Conclusion**: Among the given choices, Superstring Theory is the one that is proposed to be a complete theory that does not require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<A>>>"
