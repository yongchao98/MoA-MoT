    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reactants and products for the given Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`. In the presence of a base (NaOEt), it gets deprotonated to form a nucleophilic enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The carbon atoms are numbered starting from the carbonyl group, so the structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes an acidic α-proton from dimethyl malonate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n    2.  The malonate enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    3.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. This creates a new enolate intermediate: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    4.  This enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n*   **Product Structure (A):**\n    The final product has the structure `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Naming the Product:**\n    Let's analyze the names provided in the options. The IUPAC naming of this complex molecule can be tricky.\n    Let's analyze the name from option A: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n    *   The parent chain is propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. This corresponds to a propane chain (`C₃-C₂-C₁`) with carboxylate groups at C1 (two of them) and C3 (one of them).\n    *   The structure of the parent trimethyl ester is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-C₂H₂-C₃H₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   A `p-tolyl` group is placed at the C2 position.\n    *   This gives the structure: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    This structure matches the product derived from the reaction mechanism. Therefore, this name correctly identifies product A.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enols and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, also known as crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which proceeds via a Michael-type addition.\n    2.  The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    3.  This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n    4.  The reaction mixture is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This workup step hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone. The enamine functionality essentially serves to activate the α-position of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) for nucleophilic attack.\n*   **Product Structure (B):**\n    The final product is a cyclohexanone ring where the α-carbon (C2) is substituted with the remnant of the Michael acceptor. The acceptor `CH₃-CH=CH-CN` becomes the group `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` upon addition.\n    The product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: `2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexanone`.\n*   **Naming the Product:**\n    The product can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is `butanenitrile`. A `2-oxocyclohexyl` group is attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name in the options, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, describes the enol tautomer. Under acidic workup, the more stable keto form is the major product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactant C (Michael Donor):** To be determined.\n    *   **Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Analysis (Retrosynthesis):**\n    1.  We need to identify the bond formed during the Michael addition. The acceptor, MVK, adds as a `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` group (a `3-oxobutyl` group).\n    2.  In the product, this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n    3.  This means the nucleophile that attacked MVK was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    4.  The C2 position of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is flanked by two carbonyl groups, making the protons on this carbon particularly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The base (KOH) easily deprotonates this position to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Reactant C Structure:**\n    Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThese three components match the descriptions in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
