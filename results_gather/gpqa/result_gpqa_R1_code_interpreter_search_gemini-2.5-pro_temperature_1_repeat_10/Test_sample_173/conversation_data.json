    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Define the initial state and given parameters:**\n*   Initial nucleus is at rest.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, E_M = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses m1 and m2.\n\n**2. Determine the rest masses of the fragments:**\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: m1 = 2 * m2. This also means their rest-mass energies are related: m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2.\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M. In terms of energy: m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2.\n*   Substitute the given values: m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   Now we have a system of two equations:\n    1.  m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV\n    2.  m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2\n*   Substitute (2) into (1): (2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV => 3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energies:\n    *   m2*c^2 = 297 GeV / 3 = 99 GeV.\n    *   m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   The more massive fragment is m1.\n\n**3. Calculate the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy Released):**\n*   The energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   Q = E_M - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n*   This is the total kinetic energy shared by the two fragments: T_total = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the system is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be 'p'.\n*   |**p1**| = |**p2**| = p.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy (T) is related to momentum (p) by T = p^2 / (2m).\n*   So, T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1) and T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2).\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is: T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2, which means T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n*   We know that T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV.\n*   Substituting T2_classical: T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV => 3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   Therefore, T1_classical = 1 GeV.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1:**\n*   In relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n*   The total energy is also E = T + m*c^2, where T is the kinetic energy.\n*   Substituting this, we get (T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n*   Expanding and rearranging for (p*c)^2: T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2 => (p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) = T * (T + 2*m*c^2).\n*   From conservation of momentum, p1 = p2, so (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2.\n*   T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2).\n*   We know T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1. Let's substitute the known values (in GeV):\n    *   T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)\n    *   T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)\n    *   T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)\n    *   T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2\n    *   T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2\n    *   396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1\n    *   (396 + 204)*T1 = 603\n    *   600 * T1 = 603\n    *   T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the difference:**\n*   Difference = (Correct T1) - (Classical T1)\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV: 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nTo verify the calculations, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\n\n# Initial rest-mass energy\nE_M = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments\n# m1_c2 + m2_c2 = 0.99 * E_M\n# m1_c2 = 2 * m2_c2\nsum_m_c2 = 0.99 * E_M\nm2_c2 = sum_m_c2 / 3.0\nm1_c2 = 2.0 * m2_c2\n\n# Q-value (total kinetic energy)\nQ = E_M - sum_m_c2\n\n# Classical calculation for T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment)\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1\n# We derived the equation: 600 * T1 = 603\nT1_relativistic = 603.0 / 600.0\n\n# Difference between relativistic and classical values\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000.0\n\nprint(f\"The difference is {difference_MeV} MeV.\")\n```\n\n5.0\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value of T1 and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Given Information**\n\n*   An atomic nucleus is initially at rest.\n*   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, let's call their rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\n*   We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say `m1` is the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   In terms of energy, the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is: `E_fragments_rest = m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   Substituting the value of `M*c^2`: `E_fragments_rest = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we have a system of two equations to find the individual rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n*   Substitute the second equation into the first: `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   This simplifies to `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m2*c^2 = 297 GeV / 3 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\n*   The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n*   `Q = E_initial - E_fragments_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, where `T1` and `T2` are the kinetic energies of the massive and less massive fragments, respectively.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is: `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n\n*   We must again use the conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`).\n*   The relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - mc^2`.\n*   Rearranging the energy-momentum equation gives: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n*   Therefore: `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (`m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`) and the relation `T2 = 3 - T1`:\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2*198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2*99)`\n    `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n*   Cancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Combine the `T1` terms:\n    `(396 + 204) * T1 = 603`\n    `600 * T1 = 603`\n*   Solve for the correct relativistic kinetic energy `T1`:\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\n*   The difference between the correct (relativistic) and the classical value is:\n    `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert this difference to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
