    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached. The formula of this fragment is C6H4.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the proposed formulas. An ester group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). For two different substituents, a para-substituted ring gives the simplest spectrum, often appearing as two distinct signals (two doublets, an AA'BB' system). This is the most likely pattern for only two aromatic signals.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n        *   Let's call the protons `R-CHa=CHb-CH3`.\n        *   Proton Ha is adjacent to proton Hb, so it is split into a **doublet**.\n        *   Proton Hb is adjacent to proton Ha (1 proton) and the -CH3 group (3 protons). It is split into a doublet by Ha and a quartet by the -CH3 group, resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) we just identified.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the other substituent, which contains the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. The molecule contains no methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. This rules out substituents like ethyl (`-CH2CH3`), propyl (`-CH2CH2CH3`), etc. The second methyl group must be directly attached to a part of the ester that has no other adjacent protons, for example, a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`).\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3` (formula `C3H5`)\n*   An ester group containing a methyl group, with no CH2 groups. The two possibilities are:\n    *   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n    *   An acetate group attached to the ring via oxygen: `-OCOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n\nLet's combine these fragments to build the whole molecule and determine its formula.\n*   Carbons: `C6` (from ring) + `C3` (from propenyl) + `C2` (from ester part) = **C11**\n*   Hydrogens: `H4` (from ring) + `H5` (from propenyl) + `H3` (from methyl ester/acetate) = **H12**\n*   Oxygens: `O2` (from ester)\n\nThe assembled molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe DBE (or index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** Benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE) + C=C in propenyl group (1 DBE) + C=O in ester group (1 DBE) = **Total 6 DBE**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given options using the formula DBE = C + 1 - H/2:\n*   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect, not enough unsaturation)\n*   B) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. (**Matches our structure**)\n*   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect, requires an extra ring or double bond not indicated by the data)\n*   D) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (DBE matches, but this formula is C11H12O2 + CH2. Adding a CH2 group would create a -CH2- signal in the NMR, which is explicitly ruled out).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the formula C11H12O2 is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information. It has the correct degree of unsaturation, and a molecule with this formula can be constructed (e.g., methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate) that perfectly matches the described 1H NMR signals without containing any -CH2- groups.\n\n<<<B>>>"
