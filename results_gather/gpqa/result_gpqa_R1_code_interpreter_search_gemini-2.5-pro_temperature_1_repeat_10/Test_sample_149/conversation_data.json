    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is consistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. It appears as a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, represent the two pairs of equivalent protons on the ring (AA'BB' system).\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet with an integration of 2 protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The electron-donating nature of the -NH2 group also explains why the aromatic protons are shifted upfield (to lower ppm values) compared to benzene (7.34 ppm).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Putting the fragments together: a p-substituted aminobenzene ring and a -CH2-CHO group. The only way to connect them to match the formula C8H9NO is to attach the -CH2-CHO group to the benzene ring at the position para to the amino group.\n\n    The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This set of reagents is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-). The product of this step is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *Structure after step 1:* [Cl-][+N≡N]–C6H4–CH2–CHO\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to a diazonium salt solution and warming it causes hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction is a standard method to synthesize phenols from anilines.\n    *Structure after step 2:* **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** (HO–C6H4–CH2–CHO)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This aldehyde possesses α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group), which are acidic. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction. The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        *   Aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxyl group and the α-hydrogen are removed to form a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The conjugation of the new C=C double bond with the C=O group (and also with one of the aromatic rings) makes this dehydration step thermodynamically favorable.\n\nLet's trace the formation of the final condensation product:\n*   Aldol addition product (structure D):\n    HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO\n    (Numbering from the aldehyde: C4-C3-C2-C1)\n*   Dehydration involves removing the -OH from C3 (the β-carbon) and the -H from C2 (the α-carbon).\n*   Final condensation product:\n    HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO\n    The IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe overall transformation is:\n4-aminophenylacetaldehyde → 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde → 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nSince the question asks for the final product and the last step involves heating, the dehydrated condensation product (A) is the expected final product, not the intermediate aldol addition product (D).\n\n<<<A>>>"
