    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the geometrical position, represented by a Bloch vector `r = (rx, ry, rz)`, of a given density matrix $\\rho$ in the qubit space (also known as the Bloch sphere).\n\n2.  **Recall the General Form of a Density Matrix:** Any single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix `I` and the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$) using the Bloch vector `r = (rx, ry, rz)`. The formula is:\n\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z)$\n\n3.  **Express the Given Density Matrix in Matrix Form:**\n    The given density matrix is:\n    $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\n    First, let's find the matrix representations of the components:\n    *   The computational basis states are: $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The corresponding outer products (projectors) are:\n        *   $|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        *   $|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for $\\rho$:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    This is simply half of the 2x2 identity matrix:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\n4.  **Find the Bloch Vector `r`:**\n    We now have two expressions for $\\rho$:\n    *   From the problem: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n    *   From the general formula: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z)$\n\n    Let's equate them:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z)$\n\n    Multiply both sides by 2:\n    $I = I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\n    Subtract `I` from both sides:\n    $0 = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\n    The Pauli matrices are linearly independent. This means the only way their weighted sum can equal the zero matrix is if all the weights (coefficients) are zero.\n    Therefore, we must have:\n    $r_x = 0$\n    $r_y = 0$\n    $r_z = 0$\n\n    So, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Interpretation:**\n    The vector `r=(0,0,0)` corresponds to the origin (the center) of the Bloch sphere. This state, $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$, is known as the **maximally mixed state**. It represents a qubit with a 50% chance of being measured as $|0\\rangle$ and a 50% chance of being measured as $|1\\rangle$, with no phase information.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) r=(1,1,1)\n    *   B) r=(0,0,0)\n    *   C) r=(1,1,0)\n    *   D) r=(0,0,1)\n\n    Our calculated result `r=(0,0,0)` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
