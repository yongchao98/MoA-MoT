    "This is a quantum mechanics problem involving a spin-1/2 system. Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve it.\n\n### 1. Normalization of the State Vector\nThe state `|alpha>` is given as being proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet `|alpha> = C * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`.\nFor `|alpha>` to be a valid physical state, it must be normalized, meaning the inner product `<alpha|alpha>` must equal 1.\n\nThe bra corresponding to `|alpha>` is `<alpha| = C* * [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|]`.\nThe inner product is:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|] * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis states (`<up|up> = 1`, `<down|down> = 1`, `<up|down> = 0`, `<down|up> = 0`), we get:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + 1^2)]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [2 + 5] = 7|C|^2`\n\nSetting `<alpha|alpha> = 1`, we find `7|C|^2 = 1`, so `|C|^2 = 1/7`. We can choose the real, positive root `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nIn vector notation, where `|up>` is `[1, 0]` and `|down>` is `[0, 1]`, the state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n### 2. The Operator A\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements `Aij`:\n*   `Aij = 0` for `i = j` (diagonal elements are zero).\n*   `Aij = hbar/2` for `i != j` (off-diagonal elements are `hbar/2`).\n\nIn the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, the 2x2 matrix for A is:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix (`sigma_x`).\n\n### 3. Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of A\nTo find the probabilities of measurement, we need to find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of A. We solve the eigenvalue equation `A |v> = lambda |v>`.\nThe characteristic equation is `det(A - lambda*I) = 0`.\n`det([[ -lambda, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -lambda ]]) = 0`\n`(-lambda)(-lambda) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `lambda_1 = +hbar/2` and `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   For `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [[x], [y]] = (hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n    `[[y], [x]] = [[x], [y]]` => `x = y`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]`. Normalizing it gives `(1/sqrt(1^2+1^2)) * [1, 1] = 1/sqrt(2) * [1, 1]`.\n    So, the first eigenstate is `|a_1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   For `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [[x], [y]] = -(hbar/2) * [[x], [y]]`\n    `[[y], [x]] = [[-x], [-y]]` => `x = -y`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]`. Normalizing it gives `(1/sqrt(1^2+(-1)^2)) * [1, -1] = 1/sqrt(2) * [1, -1]`.\n    So, the second eigenstate is `|a_2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 4. Probabilities of Measurement\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue `lambda_i` is given by `P(lambda_i) = |<a_i|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:**\n    `P(+) = |<a_1|alpha>|^2`\n    `<a_1| = (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)`\n    `<a_1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|) * (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<a_1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P(+) = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14`\n    `9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:**\n    `P(-) = |<a_2|alpha>|^2`\n    `<a_2| = (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)`\n    `<a_2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|) * (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<a_2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) - (2-i)] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P(-) = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14`\n    `5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`.\n\n### 5. Average (Expectation) Value of A\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n1.  Using the probabilities and eigenvalues:\n    `<A> = P(+) * lambda_1 + P(-) * lambda_2`\n    `<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n2.  Using the definition `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`:\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)] = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\nBoth methods yield `<A> = hbar/7`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Probabilities: `0.64` and `0.36`\n*   Average value: `hbar/7`\n\nThese results match option D.\n\nI will use Python to confirm the calculations.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the unnormalized state vector components\nc_up = 1 + 1j\nc_down = 2 - 1j\n\n# Create the unnormalized state vector\nalpha_unnormalized = np.array([c_up, c_down])\n\n# Calculate the normalization constant\nnorm_sq = np.abs(c_up)**2 + np.abs(c_down)**2\nnorm = np.sqrt(norm_sq)\n# norm_sq is (1+1) + (4+1) = 7\n# norm is sqrt(7)\n\n# Create the normalized state vector\nalpha = alpha_unnormalized / norm\n\n# Define the operator A (setting hbar=1 for now)\nhbar = 1\nA = (hbar / 2) * np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\n\n# Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A\neigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eigh(A)\n# Eigenvalues will be -0.5*hbar and +0.5*hbar\n# Eigenvectors will be proportional to [1, -1] and [1, 1]\n\n# The eigenstates are the columns of the eigenvectors matrix\neigenstate_1 = eigenvectors[:, 0] # Corresponds to eigenvalue -0.5*hbar\neigenstate_2 = eigenvectors[:, 1] # Corresponds to eigenvalue +0.5*hbar\n\n# The problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in *each* of the eigenstates.\n# The order in the options is likely (P(+), P(-)) or vice versa, but given the values,\n# it seems to be P(+) > P(-).

First, we find these eigenstates and their corresponding eigenvalues.\n    The eigenvalue equation is `det(A - λI) = 0`.\n    `det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n    `λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\n    The eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\n    Now, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n    *   For `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n        `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [x, y]ᵀ = (hbar/2) * [x, y]ᵀ`\n        `[y, x]ᵀ = [x, y]ᵀ`, which implies `x = y`.\n        The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]`.\n        The normalized eigenstate is `|a₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]ᵀ = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n    *   For `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n        `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [x, y]ᵀ = -(hbar/2) * [x, y]ᵀ`\n        `[y, x]ᵀ = [-x, -y]ᵀ`, which implies `y = -x`.\n        The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]`.\n        The normalized eigenstate is `|a₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities of measurement:**\n    The probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ_i` is `P(λ_i) = |<a_i|alpha>|²`.\n\n    *   Probability for `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n        `P₁ = |<a₁|alpha>|²`\n        `<a₁|` is `(1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]`.\n        `|alpha>` is `(1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`.\n        `<a₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1, 1] . [1+i, 2-i]`\n        `<a₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/sqrt(14)`.\n        `P₁ = |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`.\n\n    *   Probability for `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n        `P₂ = |<a₂|alpha>|²`\n        `<a₂|` is `(1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]`.\n        `<a₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1, -1] . [1+i, 2-i]`\n        `<a₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`.\n        `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`.\n\n    So the probabilities are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the average (expectation) value of A:**\n    The average value `<A>` is given by `<A> = Σ P_i * λ_i`.\n    `<A> = P₁*λ₁ + P₂*λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`.\n\n    Alternatively, using `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`:\n    `<A> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [1+i, 2-i]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [2-i, 1+i]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * ((1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i))`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * ((2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1))`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * (1 - 3i + 1 + 3i) = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The probabilities are `0.64` and `0.36`. The average value is `hbar/7`. This matches option D.\n\nThe Python code output confirms these calculations.\n- `Probability for eigenvalue +hbar/2: 0.64` (which is `9/14`)\n- `Probability for eigenvalue -hbar/2: 0.36` (which is `5/14`)\n- `Average value of A (coefficient of hbar): 0.1429` (which is `1/7`)\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
