    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The gravity of an orbiting planet causes the star to \"wobble\" around the common center of mass of the star-planet system. This wobble results in a change in the star's velocity along our line of sight.\n\nThe Doppler effect relates the change in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line to the star's radial velocity ($v_{r}$):\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, known as $K$:\n$$ K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max} $$\n\n**2. Relate the Given Information to the Physical Quantities**\n\nWe are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n- Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n- Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n\nFrom the proportionality above, we can find the ratio of the stellar radial velocity amplitudes:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n**3. Derive the Relationship Between Stellar Velocity Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (T)**\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude ($K$) of a star with mass $M_{star}$ due to a planet with mass $M_{planet}$ in a circular orbit of period $T$ is:\n$$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}} $$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThe problem states:\n- The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n- The planets have the same mass: $M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$.\n- Since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are Sun-like, we can approximate $M_{star} + M_{planet} \\approx M_{star}$.\n\nWith these conditions, the terms involving mass ($M_{planet}$ and $M_{star}$) are the same for both systems. While the inclination angle $i$ is unknown for each system, it's a standard assumption in such problems (unless stated otherwise) that we are comparing the underlying physical relationship, effectively treating $\\sin(i)$ as a constant factor or assuming an edge-on view ($i=90^\\circ, \\sin(i)=1$) for both.\n\nTherefore, all factors in the equation for $K$ are constant for both systems except for the orbital period $T$. This simplifies the relationship to:\n$$ K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}} $$\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nUsing the proportionality from step 3, we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{1/T_2^{1/3}}{1/T_1^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\nNow, substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes we found in step 2:\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nTo find the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$ \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.36443 $$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
