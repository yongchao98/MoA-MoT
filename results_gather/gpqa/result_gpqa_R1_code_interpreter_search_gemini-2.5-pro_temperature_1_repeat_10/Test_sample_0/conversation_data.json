    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime, there is an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy level.\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Lifetime and Energy Uncertainty:** The lifetime of a state (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the energy width (uncertainty) of a state is approximately:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths. This is analogous to the Rayleigh criterion in optics. The energy levels are \"blurry\" due to their finite lifetimes, and to see them as separate, the gap between them must be wider than their combined blurriness.\n    *   Required Condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   |E₁ - E₂| > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    Even if we take a less strict condition that the separation must be larger than the largest of the two widths, we would need |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁, which is |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We need to find an energy difference from the options that satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy separation large enough to overcome the combined energy uncertainty of the two states, allowing them to be clearly resolved.\n\nI will use a python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eV_s = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using Delta_E = h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eV_s / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eV_s / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be\n# greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.\nrequired_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required energy separation for resolution must be greater than: {required_energy_difference:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-4\n}\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Comparing with options ---\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference for clear resolution.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT large enough for clear resolution.\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem about resolving two quantum energy levels.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Principle:** The problem hinges on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the uncertainty (or \"width\") of its energy level. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Lifetime of state 1 (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ seconds.\n*   Lifetime of state 2 (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ seconds.\n*   Goal: Find the minimum energy difference (|E₁ - E₂|) required to \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" these two levels.\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation Plan:**\n    *   **Step 1:** For each state, calculate its energy uncertainty (ΔE) using its lifetime (τ) as the time uncertainty (Δt). The formula simplifies to ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. I need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s, which is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   **Step 2:** Calculate ΔE₁ for state 1: ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s).\n    *   **Step 3:** Calculate ΔE₂ for state 2: ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s).\n    *   **Step 4:** Determine the condition for \"clear resolution\". For two spectral lines (or energy levels) to be resolved, the separation between their centers must be greater than the sum of their half-widths. In this context, a conservative and common criterion is that the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than the sum of their energy widths, ΔE₁ + ΔE₂.\n    *   **Step 5:** Calculate the required minimum separation: Total Width = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂.\n    *   **Step 6:** Compare this required separation with the given options (A, B, C, D) and find the option that satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).\n\n**4. Execute the Plan (Mental or Scratchpad Calculation):**\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻¹⁶ / 10⁻⁹ = 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻¹⁶ / 10⁻⁸ = 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   Total Width (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂) = (6.58 x 10⁻⁷) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷) eV ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   The required energy difference must be greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Compare with options:\n        *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV << 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n        *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV << 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n        *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV = 1 x 10⁻⁸ eV. This is 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV, which is << 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n        *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is >> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Verification using Python Code:**\nThe previous step already generated Python code to perform these calculations precisely. The output confirms the manual calculation.\n\n*   `Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.5821e-07 eV`\n*   `Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.5821e-08 eV`\n*   `Required energy separation for resolution must be greater than: 7.2403e-07 eV`\n\nThe code then checks the options against this requirement:\n*   Options A, B, and C are all smaller than 7.2403e-07 eV.\n*   Option D (1e-4 eV) is significantly larger than 7.2403e-07 eV.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion:**\nThe calculations, both manual and via the Python script, show that an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is the only one large enough to resolve the two energy levels, given their lifetime-induced energy broadening. Therefore, option D is the correct answer. **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves the lifetime of quantum states and their energy levels. This directly points to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle relates the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) by the inequality:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π). A commonly used approximation in such problems is ΔE ⋅ Δt ≈ ħ.\n\n3.  **Relate lifetime to energy uncertainty:** The lifetime of a state (τ) can be considered the time uncertainty (Δt). Therefore, the energy level is not perfectly sharp but has a \"width\" or uncertainty (ΔE) given by:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy width for each state:** We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units that are convenient for this problem, which are electron-volts (eV) and seconds (s).\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the condition for \"clear resolution\":** To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be larger than their combined uncertainty. A standard criterion (similar to the Rayleigh criterion in optics) is that the separation must be greater than the sum of their individual widths.\n    *   Condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n6.  **Calculate the required minimum energy difference:**\n    *   Required Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Required Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Required Difference > 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n7.  **Compare the required difference with the given options:** We need to find the option that is greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV << 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV << 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV << 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV >> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Only option D provides an energy separation that is significantly larger than the combined energy widths of the two states. This large separation ensures that the energy distributions of the two states do not overlap significantly, allowing them to be clearly resolved. The Python code execution confirms this calculation precisely.\n\n<<<D>>>"
