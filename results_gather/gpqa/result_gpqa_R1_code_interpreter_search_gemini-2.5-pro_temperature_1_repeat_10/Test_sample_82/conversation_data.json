    "This problem requires a two-part calculation for the pH of an acetic acid solution during titration with NaOH. First, we determine the pH at 25% completion of the titration, and second, we determine the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid:**\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid (HAc): `moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol`.\n    *   The initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   The new total volume is `20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L`.\n    *   The new concentration of acetic acid is `M_new = moles / V_new = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M`.\n\n2.  **Titration Reaction:**\n    The reaction is: `CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O`\n\n3.  **Buffer Region:**\n    At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% remains as acetic acid. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n4.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\n    `pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`\n    *   `[A⁻]` is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n    *   `[HA]` is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n    *   `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)`\n    *   The ratio `[A⁻]/[HA]` is `0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3`.\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    `pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)`\n    `pH ≈ 4.7328 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2557`\n\n**Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Moles at Equivalence:**\n    At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (0.001 mol) has reacted completely with the NaOH to form 0.001 mol of sodium acetate (NaAc).\n\n2.  **Volume at Equivalence:**\n    *   First, we find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize 0.001 mol of HAc:\n        `V_NaOH = moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³`.\n    *   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n        `V_total = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L`.\n\n3.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    The solution now contains sodium acetate. The acetate ion (Ac⁻) is a weak base that hydrolyzes in water:\n    `CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻`\n    *   The concentration of acetate is `[Ac⁻] = moles / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M`.\n\n4.  **Calculating pOH and pH:**\n    We need to find the concentration of OH⁻ produced by this hydrolysis.\n    *   First, calculate Kb for acetate: `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰`.\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression `Kb = [HAc][OH⁻] / [Ac⁻]`, we can approximate `[OH⁻]` as:\n        `[OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * [Ac⁻]) = sqrt((5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M`.\n    *   Now, calculate pOH: `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483`.\n    *   Finally, calculate pH: `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517`.\n\nTo get precise values, we can use a script for the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# The ratio of [A-]/[HA] at 25% titration is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Initial moles of acetic acid\nmoles_HAc = 0.05 * 0.020  # M * L\n\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence\nvolume_NaOH_eq = moles_HAc / 0.1  # L\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nvolume_total_eq = 0.040 + volume_NaOH_eq  # L (initial diluted volume + NaOH volume)\n\n# Concentration of acetate (conjugate base) at equivalence point\nconc_Ac_minus = moles_HAc / volume_total_eq  # M\n\n# Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_Ac_minus)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Initial Substance:** 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   **Dilution:** Add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   **Titrant:** 0.1 M Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH).\n    *   **Constants:** Ka for acetic acid = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵, Temperature = 25 °C (so Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴).\n    *   **Goals:**\n        1.  Calculate the pH at 25% titration.\n        2.  Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Analyze the Dilution**\n    *   First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid (HAc).\n        *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n        *   Moles of HAc = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.00100 mol.\n    *   After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes:\n        *   Total Volume (V_total) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n    *   The concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution is:\n        *   New Concentration (M_new) = Moles / V_total = 0.00100 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n    *   This 0.025 M solution is what we start the titration with.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Calculate pH at 25% Titration**\n    *   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O. This is a 1:1 reaction.\n    *   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n    *   At this point, the solution contains:\n        *   75% of the original acetic acid (HA).\n        *   25% of the conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).\n    *   This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base is a **buffer solution**.\n    *   The best tool to calculate the pH of a buffer is the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**:\n        *   pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   First, calculate pKa:\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n    *   The ratio of concentrations `[A⁻]/[HA]` is equal to the ratio of moles, which is `0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3`.\n    *   Now, plug the values into the equation:\n        *   pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\n    *   Let's perform the calculation.\n        *   -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.7328\n        *   log(1/3) ≈ -0.4771\n        *   pH ≈ 4.7328 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2557\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point**\n    *   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n        *   Moles of HAc = 0.00100 mol.\n        *   Moles of NaOH needed = 0.00100 mol.\n    *   Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required:\n        *   Volume_NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains 0.00100 mol of CH₃COONa.\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the solution at this point:\n        *   V_equivalence = (Volume of diluted acid) + (Volume of NaOH added)\n        *   V_equivalence = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (A⁻) in the solution:\n        *   [A⁻] = Moles / V_equivalence = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M.\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n        *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   To find the pH, we must first find the [OH⁻]. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n        *   Ka × Kb = Kw (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C)\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Now, set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let [OH⁻] = x. Then [CH₃COOH] also = x. The concentration of [CH₃COO⁻] at equilibrium will be (0.020 - x). Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.020 - x) ≈ 0.020.\n        *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ (x)(x) / 0.020\n        *   x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Now, calculate pOH:\n        *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   Finally, calculate pH:\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n5.  **Final Check and Code Verification**\n    *   The manual calculations gave pH ≈ 4.26 and pH ≈ 8.52.\n    *   Let's write a simple python script to confirm these values precisely.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Step 1: Initial conditions and dilution\ninitial_moles_HAc = 0.05 * 0.020  # Molarity * Volume in L\nvolume_after_dilution = 0.040 # L\n\n# Step 2: Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence\nvolume_NaOH_eq = initial_moles_HAc / 0.1  # L\n\n# Step 3: Total volume and concentration of acetate at equivalence\ntotal_volume_eq = volume_after_dilution + volume_NaOH_eq  # L\nconc_Acetate = initial_moles_HAc / total_volume_eq  # M\n\n# Step 4: Hydrolysis calculation\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Kb = [OH-][HAc] / [Ac-].

    "Here is the step-by-step solution based on the calculations:\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Dilution:** The initial 0.001 moles of acetic acid (0.05 M * 0.020 L) are diluted into a new volume of 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). The new concentration is 0.025 M, but for this part, only the mole ratio matters.\n2.  **Buffer Formation:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution where the ratio of [A⁻] to [HA] is 25:75 or 1:3.\n3.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** We use this equation to find the pH of the buffer:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   First, calculate the pKa:\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   Now, plug in the values:\n        pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n        pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n        pH ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Equivalence Point Conditions:** At this point, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by an equal number of moles of NaOH. The solution contains 0.001 moles of the product, sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO).\n2.  **Volume at Equivalence:** We need to find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to deliver 0.001 moles:\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L or 10.00 cm³.\n3.  **Total Volume and Concentration:** The total volume of the solution is the sum of the diluted acid and the added NaOH:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    The concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] is:\n    [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n4.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion is a weak base and reacts with water (hydrolyzes) to produce OH⁻, making the solution basic.\n    A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n5.  **Calculate [OH⁻]:** We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    Now, we can find the hydroxide concentration:\n    [OH⁻] = √(Kb * [A⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n6.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point.
