    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Determine the molecular formula of the compound.\n2.  Count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n3.  Calculate the total energy required to atomize the elements in their standard states to form the gaseous atoms needed for the compound (enthalpy of atomization of reactants).\n4.  Calculate the total energy released when these gaseous atoms form one mole of the compound (this is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound).\n5.  Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) using the relationship: ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the compound).\n6.  Convert the result to the units required by the answer options (kJ/g).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula.**\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   Carbons: 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from methyl on CH) + 1 + 1 + 1 (from C) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens: 2*3 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 (from CH) + 3 (from methyl on CH) + 2 + 1 + 2*3 (from (CH3)2) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogens.\nThe molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n**Step 2: Count the number of bonds.**\n*   **C-H bonds**: There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each singly bonded to a carbon atom. So, there are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (=). So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds**: We can determine the number of C-C single bonds using the valency of carbon. Each of the 12 carbon atoms forms 4 bonds. The total number of bond valencies from all carbon atoms is 12 * 4 = 48. This total is distributed among C-H, C-C, and C=C bonds.\n    Total valencies = (No. of C-H bonds * 1) + (No. of C-C bonds * 2) + (No. of C=C bonds * 4).\n    48 = (22 * 1) + (N_CC * 2) + (2 * 4)\n    48 = 22 + 2 * N_CC + 8\n    48 = 30 + 2 * N_CC\n    2 * N_CC = 18\n    N_CC = 9. So, there are 9 C-C single bonds.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants.**\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nWe need to calculate the enthalpy change for converting the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g)).\n*   Enthalpy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Enthalpy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol.\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol.\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of the compound = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f).**\nΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**Step 6: Convert to kJ/g.**\nThe options are given in kJ/g or kJ/mol. Our calculated value of 1900 kJ/mol is not an option. Let's convert it to kJ/g.\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.011) + (22 * 1.008) g/mol ≈ 166.3 g/mol. (Using integer masses: 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol)\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.445 kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\nThe final calculation can be done with a simple script:\n```python\n# Given values\ndelta_h_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbe_H_H = 100          # kJ/mol\nbe_C_C = 200          # kJ/mol\nbe_C_eq_C = 300       # kJ/mol\nbe_C_H = 400          # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\nnum_C_eq_C_bonds = 2\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9  # (12 * 4 - 22 * 1 - 2 * 4) / 2 = 9\n\n# Molar mass\nmolar_mass_C = 12\nmolar_mass_H = 1\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = num_C * molar_mass_C + num_H * molar_mass_H\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of reactants for the formation of C12H22\n# Reaction: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)\nh_atom_reactants = num_C * delta_h_atom_C + (num_H / 2) * be_H_H\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of the product (C12H22)\nh_atom_product = num_C_C_bonds * be_C_C + num_C_eq_C_bonds * be_C_eq_C + num_C_H_bonds * be_C_H\n\n# Enthalpy of formation (in kJ/mol)\ndelta_h_f_mol = h_atom_reactants - h_atom_product\n\n# Enthalpy of formation (in kJ/g)\ndelta_h_f_gram = delta_h_f_mol / molar_mass_C12H22\n\nprint(delta_h_f_gram)\n```\n>>>11.44578313253012\n\nThe result is approximately 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We can count the single bonds from the structure or calculate them. Total valency for 12 carbons is 12 * 4 = 48. The valencies are satisfied by C-H, C-C, and C=C bonds.\n    Valencies used by H = 22 * 1 = 22.\n    Valencies used by C=C bonds = 2 * 4 = 8.\n    Remaining valencies for C-C bonds = 48 - 22 - 8 = 18.\n    Since each C-C single bond accounts for 2 valencies, the number of C-C bonds = 18 / 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants.**\n\nThe formation reaction for C12H22 from its elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert the reactants into gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) and 22 H(g).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ = 12000 kJ.\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds = 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ = 1100 kJ.\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total bond energy of the product (enthalpy of atomization of C12H22).**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ = 1800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ = 600 kJ.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ = 8800 kJ.\n*   Total bond energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n    *(Note: This value matches option C, which is a common distractor.
