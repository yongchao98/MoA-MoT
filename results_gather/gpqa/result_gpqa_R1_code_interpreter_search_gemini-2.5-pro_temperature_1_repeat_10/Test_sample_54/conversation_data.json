    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal strongly indicates the presence of an acetyl group (CH₃-C(=O)-). All four given options contain an acetate group (CH₃COO-), so this is consistent.\n\n    2.  **Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):**\n        *   These two signals are in the chemical shift range for protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl protons). The presence of two such signals, each with an integration of 1H, indicates a -CH=CH- fragment.\n\n    3.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to one vinyl proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** The magnitude of the coupling constant is crucial for determining stereochemistry. A J value of ~12-18 Hz for vinyl protons is characteristic of a *trans* configuration. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller J value (typically 6-12 Hz).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal represents one of the vinyl protons in a *trans* double bond.\n\n    4.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This is the second vinyl proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n            *   The **doublet (d)** splitting comes from coupling to the other vinyl proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). The coupling constant for this interaction must be 16.0 Hz.\n            *   The **quartet (q)** splitting means this proton is also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n\n    5.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond.\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This represents a methyl group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms the 'quartet' splitting seen for the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have an acetate group: `CH₃COO-`.\n    *   We have a `trans`-substituted double bond with two protons: `-CH=CH-`.\n    *   One of the vinyl carbons is attached to a methyl group: `-CH=CH-CH₃`.\n    *   The coupling pattern confirms this arrangement. The proton at 5.5 ppm is the one adjacent to the methyl group (`=CH-CH₃`), which causes its signal to be a doublet of quartets. The methyl group itself is split into a doublet by this proton. The other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm) is only coupled to the first vinyl proton, resulting in a simple doublet.\n    *   The full structure is `CH₃COO-CH=CH-CH₃`, where the double bond has a *trans* geometry.\n    *   This compound is named **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect. The J-coupling constant (16.0 Hz) indicates a trans, not cis, configuration.\n    *   B) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. A butenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`) would show signals for an ethyl group, not a single methyl group attached directly to the double bond. The splitting pattern would be much more complex.\n    *   C) Trans-propenyl acetate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided 1H NMR data: the acetyl singlet, the two trans-coupled vinyl protons, the methyl group on the double bond, and all corresponding splitting patterns and integrations.\n    *   D) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. This is wrong on both the stereochemistry (cis) and the carbon chain length (butenyl).\n\n<<<C>>>"
