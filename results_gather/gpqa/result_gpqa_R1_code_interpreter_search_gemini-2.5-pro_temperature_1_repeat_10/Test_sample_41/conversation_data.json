    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Radius:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem also states that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the relationship between the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (i and j) simplifies to:\n    T_eq_i / T_eq_j = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)\n\n    Squaring both sides gives us the relationship between the orbital radii and the temperatures:\n    a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2\n\n2.  **Calculate Ratios of Orbital Radii:**\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n    Using the formula from Step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital radii:\n    *   For Planet1 and Planet2:\n        a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96\n    *   For Planet2 and Planet3:\n        a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29\n\n3.  **Find the Orbital Radius Ratio of Planet3 to Planet1:**\n    To find the ratio of the orbital radius of Planet3 to Planet1 (a3 / a1), we can multiply the individual ratios:\n    a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1)\n    a3 / a1 = 5.29 * 1.96\n    a3 / a1 = 10.3684\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Radius to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\n    P^2 ‚àù a^3\n    For two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of their periods is:\n    (P_i / P_j)^2 = (a_i / a_j)^3\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    P_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2)\n\n    Note: The information about the planets' masses is extraneous. In orbital mechanics, the mass of the planets is usually considered negligible compared to the mass of the host star, so the simplified version of Kepler's Third Law is used.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orbital Period Ratio of Planet3 to Planet1:**\n    We need to find P3 / P1. Using the formula from Step 4 and the value of a3 / a1 from Step 3:\n    P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n    P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given temperature ratios\nT1_T2_ratio = 1.4\nT2_T3_ratio = 2.3\n\n# Calculate orbital radii ratios\n# a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2\na2_a1_ratio = T1_T2_ratio**2\n\n# a3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2\na3_a2_ratio = T2_T3_ratio**2\n\n# Calculate the overall orbital radius ratio a3/a1\na3_a1_ratio = a3_a2_ratio * a2_a1_ratio\n\n# Calculate the orbital period ratio P3/P1 using Kepler's Third Law\n# P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)\nP3_P1_ratio = a3_a1_ratio**1.5\n\nprint(f\"{P3_P1_ratio=}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nP3_P1_ratio=33.38604473873408\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 3.2\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
