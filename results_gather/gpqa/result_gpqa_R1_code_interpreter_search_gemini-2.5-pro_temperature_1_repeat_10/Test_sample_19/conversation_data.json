    "An analysis of the assumptions is as follows:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is the foundational assumption of the impulse approximation. It posits that the interaction (e.g., from an electron or neutrino) couples to a single nucleon at a time, rather than to a correlated pair or a more complex multi-nucleon system. The total nuclear response is then treated as an incoherent sum of these individual nucleon responses. This is a core component.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This assumption deals with what are known as \"final-state interactions\" (and initial-state interactions). It means that the incoming particle and the outgoing particles (the scattered particle and the ejected nucleon) do not re-interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. If they did, the observed final state would be distorted and would not reflect the properties of the initial interaction on a single \"free\" nucleon. This assumption is crucial for the simplest form of the impulse approximation, often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is a framework for describing the behavior of *nucleons within a nucleus*. It is largely agnostic to the specific model of the nucleon's internal structure (i.e., its quark and gluon composition). In fact, quarks within a nucleon are known to be highly relativistic. Therefore, this is not a required assumption for the impulse approximation; it's an incorrect statement about nucleon structure and is not relevant to the approximation's core idea.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. The approximation assumes that the interaction happens over a very short timescale. On this timescale, the potential energy due to the binding forces from other nucleons is negligible compared to the large energy transferred in the interaction. Therefore, during the collision, the nucleon's dynamics are governed by the interaction alone, as if it were a free particle. The nucleon's initial state is still that of a bound particle (with a specific momentum distribution), but the interaction itself is treated as if it were free.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe assumptions that correctly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. Assumption 3 is incorrect and irrelevant to the approximation. Therefore, the combination of 1, 2, and 4 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
