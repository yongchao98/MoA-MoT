    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base, in liquid ammonia (NH₃). The amide ion (⁻NH₂) will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from one of the positions ortho to the bromine atom.\n\nThe structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d is:\n```\n      Br\n     / \\\n  (D)C--C(H)\n   ||  ||\n  (H)C--C(H)\n     \\ /\n      C\n     (H)\n```\nThe positions ortho to the bromine (at C1) are C2 and C6.\n*   C2 is substituted with deuterium (D).\n*   C6 is substituted with hydrogen (H).\n\nThe amide ion can abstract a proton/deuteron from either of these positions, leading to two possible elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n1.  The amide ion (⁻NH₂) removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n2.  The resulting negative charge on C6 attacks C1, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n**Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n1.  The amide ion (⁻NH₂) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. Although the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), this reaction is still possible. The question asks for all *possible* products.\n2.  The resulting negative charge on C2 attacks C1, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this is a normal, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nSo, we have two different benzyne intermediates formed in the first step.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile in the reaction is the amide ion (⁻NH₂). It will attack one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n**Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\nThis intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The two carbons of the triple bond, C1 and C6, are not equivalent.\n*   **Attack at C1:** The ⁻NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH₃ yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C6:** The ⁻NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH₃ yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nThus, the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate leads to two distinct products.\n\n**Addition to benzyne (from Pathway B)**\nThis intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium label. The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent by symmetry.\n*   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack of ⁻NH₂ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation of the adjacent carbon, leads to the same single product: **aniline**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can identify all the unique organic products that can be formed.\n\n1.  From Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):\n    *   2-deuterioaniline\n    *   3-deuterioaniline\n2.  From Pathway B (via benzyne):\n    *   Aniline\n\nCombining the products from both pathways, we find there are three distinct possible organic products.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
