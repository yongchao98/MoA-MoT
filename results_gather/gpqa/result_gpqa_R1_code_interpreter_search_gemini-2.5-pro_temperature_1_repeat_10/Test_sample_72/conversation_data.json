    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed (v_rel) between them.\nb) The total energy (E_total) of the system as measured by a stationary observer.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1 (m1) = 2m\n*   Speed of astronaut 1 (v1) = 0.6c\n*   Mass of astronaut 2 (m2) = 3m\n*   Speed of astronaut 2 (v2) = 0.5c\n*   Both astronauts are moving in the same positive x-direction.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\nFor objects moving at relativistic speeds, we cannot simply subtract their velocities (0.6c - 0.5c). We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative speed when both objects move in the same direction:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nNow, substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   v1 = 0.6c\n*   v2 = 0.5c\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\nv_rel = (1/7)c\n\nNow, convert the fraction to a decimal:\nv_rel ≈ 0.142857c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of each astronaut. The total energy (E) of a single particle with rest mass (m_rest) moving at speed (v) is given by the formula:\n\nE = γ * m_rest * c²\n\nwhere γ (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n**a) Energy of Astronaut 1 (E1):**\n*   m_rest = m1 = 2m\n*   v = v1 = 0.6c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 (γ1):\nγ1 = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\nγ1 = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ1 = 1 / √(0.64)\nγ1 = 1 / 0.8\nγ1 = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate the energy of astronaut 1 (E1):\nE1 = γ1 * m1 * c²\nE1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\nE1 = 2.5 mc²\n\n**b) Energy of Astronaut 2 (E2):**\n*   m_rest = m2 = 3m\n*   v = v2 = 0.5c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 (γ2):\nγ2 = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\nγ2 = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\nγ2 = 1 / √(0.75)\nγ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866\nγ2 ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate the energy of astronaut 2 (E2):\nE2 = γ2 * m2 * c²\nE2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c²\nE2 ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**c) Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\nE_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc²\nE_total = 5.9641 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**.\n\n**5. Final Check with Python**\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform the calculations using a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 1 # We can work in units where c=1 and m=1 for simplicity\nm = 1\n\n# --- Part 1: Relative Speed ---\nv1 = 0.6 * c\nv2 = 0.5 * c\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c**2)\nprint(f\"Relative speed (in units of c): {v_rel/c:.2f}c\")\n\n# --- Part 2: Total Energy ---\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2 * m\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1/c)**2)\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * c**2\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3 * m\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2/c)**2)\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * c**2\n\n# Total energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\nprint(f\"Total Energy (in units of mc^2): {E_total/(m*c**2):.2f} mc^2\")\n```\n> Relative speed (in units of c): 0.14c\n> Total Energy (in units of mc^2): 5.96 mc^2\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed: v_rel ≈ 0.14c\n*   Total energy: E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²\n\nThese values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
