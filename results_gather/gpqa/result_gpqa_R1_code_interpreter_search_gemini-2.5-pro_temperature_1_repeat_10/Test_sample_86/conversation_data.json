    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the molecular formula and functional groups.**\n    *   The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Therefore, the substituents on the ring must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X). This means one substituent is a halogen atom (-X) attached directly to the aromatic ring, and the other substituent contains the two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A substituent with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 2: Deduce the structure of the compound.**\n    *   Based on Step 1, the compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). The molecular formula is C8H7XO. The common name for this type of molecule is a haloacetophenone.\n    *   The problem states it is a di-substituted ring. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the provided 1H NMR data options to determine the substitution pattern.**\n    *   Aromatic protons typically appear in the chemical shift range of 6.5-8.5 ppm.\n    *   Let's examine the aromatic region signals in the options:\n        *   A) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   B) No aromatic signals. This option is incorrect.\n        *   C) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   D) 6.9 (1H, s). A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n    *   Both options A and C show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This is a classic, highly symmetrical pattern characteristic of a **para (1,4) di-substituted** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, the four aromatic protons exist as two sets of chemically equivalent protons, leading to two signals that appear as doublets due to coupling with their adjacent proton.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the full 1H NMR spectrum for the deduced structure (para-haloacetophenone) and compare it with the remaining options (A and C).**\n    *   **Structure:** para-haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** As determined in Step 3, we expect two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the region of ~7.5-8.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm) than the protons ortho to the halogen.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are attached to a carbonyl. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**. This singlet will integrate to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate options A and C against the prediction.**\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has a signal at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone.\n        *   It also lacks the 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm for the acetyl methyl group.\n        *   Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for the 4 aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H at a chemical shift of 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the expected signal for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   This spectrum is a perfect match for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is provided in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
