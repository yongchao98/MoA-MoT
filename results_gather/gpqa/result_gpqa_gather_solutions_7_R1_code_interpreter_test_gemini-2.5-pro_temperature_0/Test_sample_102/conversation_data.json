Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   C1: Acetyl group (-COCH₃)\n    *   C3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   C5: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added to the benzene ring is critical. The directing effects of the groups involved are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nWe must check each sequence for chemical feasibility and correct regiochemistry.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is needed to build the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. Although the directing effects conflict, the position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is strongly favored because it avoids placing a positive charge in the reaction intermediate adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. This sequence successfully produces the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial synthesis.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence forms aniline (from steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii). This reaction **fails**. The basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene (i), then to aniline (ii), then to a diazonium salt (iii), and finally back to benzene (iv) via deamination. This is a pointless and inefficient loop. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence forms bromobenzene (i) and then p-bromonitrobenzene (ii, major product). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this product. This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, preventing Friedel-Crafts reactions. This sequence is not viable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each option, we find that options B, C, and D contain chemically unfeasible steps. Option A is the only sequence that provides a chemically sound pathway to the target molecule. The first three steps (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) correctly build the 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must perform a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed route.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct new groups to specific positions during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each sequence based on these principles.\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\nThis sequence is fundamentally flawed. Steps (i) through (iv) involve nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination (removal of the amino group). This four-step process starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a nonsensical and inefficient loop.\n\n**B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   **Step i:** Bromination of benzene yields bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitration of bromobenzene yields a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,2 or 1,4 substitution pattern, which cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5 product.\n*   **Step iii:** A Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on bromonitrobenzene. This reaction fails or gives extremely low yields because the ring is strongly deactivated by both a bromo and a nitro group. This route is not viable.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   **Step i:** Nitration of benzene yields nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Reduction of nitrobenzene yields aniline.\n*   **Step iii:** A Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. This route is not viable.\n\n**D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it introduces a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n*   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. In this case of conflicting directors, the substitution occurs at position 5, which is *meta* to the acetyl group. This yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, as the major product.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) listed in the option are nonsensical as the target molecule has already been synthesized. However, the initial three steps represent the only chemically sound and high-yield pathway to the desired product among all the choices.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each option, we can eliminate A, B, and C due to fundamental chemical impossibilities (failed reactions) or illogical sequences. Option D is the only choice that contains a correct and viable synthetic route in its initial steps.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**: The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern where all groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Substituent Directing Effects**: The order of reactions is critical. We must consider how each substituent directs the next one.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br)**: Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Determine the Optimal Synthetic Route**: To achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, it is most effective to start by introducing a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**. Introducing the acetyl group first is a good strategy. Benzene reacts with CH3COCl/AlCl3 to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step 2: Bromination**. The *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step 3: Nitration**. The final step is to nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. In this case of conflicting directors, the position that is least deactivated (position 5) is favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Match the Optimal Route to the Given Options**: The correct sequence of reaction types is Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. I will now check which option matches this sequence.\n\n    *   **Option A**: Starts with Bromination. This leads to *ortho/para* products, which is the wrong pattern.\n    *   **Option B**: Starts with Nitration, then a series of reactions that ultimately revert the molecule to benzene. This is a nonsensical route.\n    *   **Option C**: The first three steps are: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Acylation); ii) Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination); iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration). This perfectly matches the optimal synthetic route. The subsequent steps listed are extraneous, but the core synthesis is correct.\n    *   **Option D**: Starts with Nitration, then reduction to aniline. The third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, fails because the catalyst reacts with the basic amino group.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Option C is the only one that contains a chemically sound and logical sequence to produce the target molecule in high yield.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the target molecule and the required reaction sequence.\n# The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n# The substituents are -COCH3 (acetyl), -Br (bromo), and -NO2 (nitro) at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n# This 1,3,5-pattern requires a specific order of reactions.\n\n# Step 2: Determine the best synthetic pathway based on directing effects.\n# -COCH3 is a meta-director.\n# -Br is an ortho, para-director.\n# -NO2 is a meta-director.\n# A good strategy is to add a meta-director first.\n# Path: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration\n# 1.

An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are located at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a *meta, meta* relationship, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nThe order in which the groups are added is critical. The directing effects of the relevant groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Amino group (-NH₂):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to see if it leads to the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form **acetophenone**. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is needed to build the 1,3,5-pattern.\n2.  **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n3.  **iii) Nitration:** The ring now has an acetyl group at C1 (*meta*-director) and a bromo group at C3 (*ortho, para*-director). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. In this case of conflicting directors, the position that is least deactivated (meta to both deactivating groups) is favored. Therefore, substitution occurs at position 5, yielding the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence provide a chemically sound and high-yield route to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthesis is correct.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **i) Nitration:** Benzene is converted to nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline.\n3.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step **fails**. The basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents the acylation reaction on the ring. This sequence is not viable.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n1.  This sequence involves nitration (i), reduction (ii), diazotization (iii), and deamination (iv). This series of reactions converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to **benzene**. This is a pointless and inefficient loop. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **i) Bromination:** Benzene is converted to bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  **ii) Nitration:** This step would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, establishing a 1,2 or 1,4 substitution pattern, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5 product.\n3.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step would **fail** regardless of the previous step's outcome. The product, bromonitrobenzene, has two deactivating groups, and the strong deactivation by the nitro group prevents Friedel-Crafts reactions. This sequence is not viable.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter a thorough analysis, only Option A provides a chemically logical and viable pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The other options contain steps that are either chemically impossible under the given conditions or are nonsensical.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of the electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions is required.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\nThe substitution pattern is 1,3,5, meaning all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order in which the substituents are added is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct the position of new groups.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established chemical principles:\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene, which is then reduced to aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration (step ii) would yield a mixture of 2-bromonitrobenzene and 4-bromonitrobenzene, establishing a 1,2 or 1,4 substitution pattern. This cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-pattern. Furthermore, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by both a bromo and a nitro group, which would fail or give an extremely low yield. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence involves the nitration of benzene, reduction to aniline, diazotization, and finally deamination with H₃PO₂. This four-step process starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a nonsensical and inefficient pathway.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence is the most chemically sound approach:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is ideal for creating a 1,3,5-pattern.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In this case of conflicting directors, the position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is the major product. The reaction successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe subsequent steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are superfluous, as the target molecule has already been synthesized. This is likely an error in the question's design. However, the initial three steps represent a valid, high-yield synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each option, it is clear that sequences A, B, and C contain chemically unfeasible or illogical steps. Only sequence D outlines a correct and logical pathway in its first three steps to synthesize the target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions is critical. The directing effects of the groups involved are:\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe need to find a sequence that correctly installs the three groups in the 1,3,5-pattern. A good strategy for this pattern is to introduce a *meta*-director first.\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **i) Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step attempts to acylate aniline. The reaction **fails** because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n1.  **i) Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **iii) Diazotization:** Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n4.  **iv) Deamination:** The diazonium salt reacts with H₃PO₂ to remove the diazonium group, regenerating **benzene**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is a pointless loop that returns to the starting material. Option B is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group.\n2.  **ii) Bromination:** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (C3), correctly forming **3-bromoacetophenone**. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n3.  **iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the -Br group directs to other positions, the directing effect of the acetyl group to the C5 position is dominant in this case, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n*   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence provide a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are extraneous and likely an error in the question, but the core synthesis is correct. This is the most plausible option.\n\n**D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **i) Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  **ii) Nitration:** This step would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, establishing a 1,2 or 1,4 pattern, not the desired 1,3,5 pattern.\n3.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step attempts to acylate a bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing the Friedel-Crafts reaction to **fail**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect due to both incorrect regiochemistry and a failed reaction step.\n\n### Final Decision\nBy analyzing each option, we can see that options A, B, and D contain fatal chemical flaws.

Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired acylation. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\nThis sequence starts by forming bromobenzene, followed by nitration to yield mainly p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this product. The ring is strongly deactivated by the presence of both a bromo and a nitro group, which causes the Friedel-Crafts reaction to fail or give extremely low yields. This sequence is not a high-yield pathway.\n\n**D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\nThis sequence presents the most chemically sound route in its initial steps:\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it introduces a *meta*-director (-COCH₃).\n*   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe first three steps of this option constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and chemically nonsensical in this context, but the core pathway to the desired product is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy comparing the options, only sequence D contains a chemically viable and logical pathway to synthesize the target molecule. The other options contain steps that are either impossible under the given conditions or represent an illogical reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must carefully analyze the structure of the target molecule and the directing effects of the substituents at each step of the synthesis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship. All groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nThe order in which substituents are added via electrophilic aromatic substitution is critical, as existing groups direct new groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\n\nA successful synthesis must introduce the groups in an order that respects these directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern. We must also consider reaction feasibility.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director. This is an excellent first step.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This step correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** The ring now has an acetyl group at C1 (*meta*-director) and a bromo group at C3 (*ortho, para*-director). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. Although the directing effects are in conflict, the position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is strongly favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence constitute a valid and logical synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthesis is correct.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  This sequence begins with bromination, creating bromobenzene (an *ortho, para*-director).\n    2.  Nitration then yields mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, establishing a 1,4-pattern that cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-product.\n    3.  Furthermore, the third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation, would fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    1.  The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene and then back to benzene. This is a pointless and illogical reaction loop. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  This sequence begins with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline.\n    2.  The third step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter analyzing all options, only sequence A provides a chemically sound and viable route to the target molecule. The other options contain steps that are either chemically impossible under the given conditions or are nonsensical. The first three reactions in option A correctly build the 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed pathway is required.\n\n### **1.

The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitration of bromobenzene yields a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-bromonitrobenzene, with the *para* isomer being the major product. This establishes a 1,4-substitution pattern, which is inconsistent with the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **Step iii:** This step attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene.

The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. Although the directing effects conflict, the position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is strongly favored because it avoids placing a positive charge in the reaction intermediate adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group.

Option D is the only choice that contains a correct and viable synthetic route in its initial steps.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**: The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern where all groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Substituent Directing Effects**: The order of reactions is critical. We must consider how each substituent directs the next one.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br)**: Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Determine the Optimal Synthetic Route**: To achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, it is most effective to start by introducing a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**. Introducing the acetyl group first is a good strategy. Benzene reacts with CH3COCl/AlCl3 to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step 2: Bromination**. The *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step 3: Nitration**. The final step is to nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. In this case of conflicting directors, the position that is least deactivated (position 5) is favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Match the Optimal Route to the Given Options**: The correct sequence of reaction types is Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. I will now check which option matches this sequence.\n\n    *   **Option A**: Starts with Bromination. This leads to *ortho/para* products, which is the wrong pattern.\n    *   **Option B**: Starts with Nitration, then a series of reactions that ultimately revert the molecule to benzene.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing substituents on the ring direct where new groups will be added during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i:** Bromination of benzene yields bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitration of bromobenzene would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,2 or 1,4 pattern, which cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5 product.\n*   **Step iii:** Friedel-Crafts acylation on a bromonitrobenzene ring would fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene yields acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is needed to build the 1,3,5 pattern.\n*   **Step ii:** Bromination of acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n*   **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (C2, C4, C6), the position C5 is electronically favored for substitution because it is meta to both deactivating groups.

The basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the reaction.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   **Steps i-iv:** This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is a pointless and inefficient loop.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision**\nBy analyzing each option, it is clear that sequences A, C, and D contain chemically unfeasible or illogical steps. Sequence B is the only option that presents a chemically sound pathway to the target molecule. The first three steps (acylation, then bromination, then nitration) correctly utilize the directing effects of the substituents to build the desired 1,3,5-trisubstituted product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1.

This is a *meta, meta* substitution pattern, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical in electrophilic aromatic substitution. The directing effects of the groups are:\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3.

Step (i) forms nitrobenzene, and step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    2.  Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired acylation. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step (i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n    2.  **Step (ii) Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step (iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. Although the directing effects conflict, the position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is strongly favored, leading to the desired product, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, in high yield.\n    4.  The first three steps of this sequence constitute a valid and logical synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but they do not invalidate the core synthetic pathway.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    1.  Steps (i) through (iv) involve nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination (removal of the amino group).\n    2.  This sequence starts with benzene and, after four steps, returns to benzene. This is a nonsensical and inefficient pathway.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  Step (i) forms bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  Step (ii) nitration would yield primarily p-bromonitrobenzene, establishing a 1,4-substitution pattern that is incorrect for the target molecule.\n    3.  Furthermore, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by two deactivating groups, causing the Friedel-Crafts reaction to **fail**. This sequence is not viable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically evaluating the options, we can eliminate A, C, and D due to fundamental chemical impossibilities or illogical steps.

This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is necessary to build the 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n*   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-directing acetyl group at C1 and an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at C3. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. While the bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6, the strong deactivating effect of the acetyl group makes substitution at the position meta to it (C5) the major pathway.

This cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-pattern. Furthermore, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is strongly deactivated by both a bromo and a nitro group, which would fail or give an extremely low yield.

The reaction **fails** because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n1.  **i) Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **iii) Diazotization:** Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n4.  **iv) Deamination:** The diazonium salt reacts with H₃PO₂ to remove the diazonium group, regenerating **benzene**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is a pointless loop that returns to the starting material. Option B is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group.\n2.  **ii) Bromination:** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (C3), correctly forming **3-bromoacetophenone**. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n3.  **iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the -Br group directs to other positions, the directing effect of the acetyl group to the C5 position is dominant in this case, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n*   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence provide a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are extraneous and likely an error in the question, but the core synthesis is correct. This is the most plausible option.\n\n**D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **i) Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene.

The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Step ii:** Nitration of bromobenzene yields mainly p-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   **Step iii:** This step attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on p-bromonitrobenzene.

The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly guides the incoming bromine to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (C2, C4, C6), the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The first three steps of this sequence constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis.

Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this product. The ring is strongly deactivated by the presence of both a bromo and a nitro group, which causes the Friedel-Crafts reaction to fail or give extremely low yields. This sequence is not a high-yield pathway.\n\n**D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\nThis sequence presents the most chemically sound route in its initial steps:\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone.
