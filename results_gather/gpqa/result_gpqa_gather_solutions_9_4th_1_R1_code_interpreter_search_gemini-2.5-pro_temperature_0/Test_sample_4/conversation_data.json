The analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the mathematical derivation, with discrepancies only arising from how the final result is matched to a list of multiple-choice options.\n\n1.  **Define the Operator and Direction Vector**\n    *   The components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ are given as:\n        $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. It can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis:\n        $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n2.  **Construct the Operator $P_n$**\n    *   The operator for the component along $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    *   $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$. Since $n_y = 0$, the $P_y$ term vanishes.\n    *   $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    *   Combining the matrices gives: $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Set up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n    *   We need to solve the equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The constant factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides.

The only valid procedure is to match the derived result to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n3.  **Dimensionality of State Vectors**: A normalized state vector (eigenvector) in quantum mechanics is dimensionless.

Then, I will list the critical physical principles, such as the dimensionality of state vectors, that must be applied to evaluate the multiple-choice options. Finally, I will write a Python script that systematically applies these principles and the derived mathematical result to the specific options provided in the prompt, thereby determining the single correct answer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Mathematical Derivation (Consensus):** All candidate answers correctly perform the same derivation.\n    *   The operator for the spin component along a direction $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$ is constructed as $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ is set up with the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n    *   Solving the equation for the eigenvector components $(a, b)$ yields the ratio $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$.\n    *   Using trigonometric half-angle identities, this ratio simplifies to $\\frac{b}{a} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n    *   This implies the eigenvector is proportional to $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n    *   The norm of this vector is $\\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)} = 1$, so it is already normalized.\n    *   Therefore, the final mathematical result for the eigenvector components is **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n2.  **Careful Points for Evaluation:**\n    *   **Dimensionality:** A normalized eigenvector representing a quantum state is a dimensionless quantity. It is a vector in an abstract Hilbert space. The physical units are carried by the eigenvalues (like energy or momentum). Any option containing Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is dimensionally incorrect and must be eliminated.\n    *   **Angular Dependence:** The derivation clearly shows that the components of the eigenvector depend on the half-angle, $\\theta/2$. This is a characteristic feature of spin-1/2 systems. Any option with a different angular dependence (e.g., on $\\theta$) is incorrect.\n    *   **Source of Confusion:** The candidate answers show that the mathematical derivation is robust. The confusion arises solely from matching the correct result to a list of options that was apparently scrambled for different agents. The only valid procedure is to match the result to the options provided in the original question.\n\n3.  **Final Decision Logic:**\n    The correct choice must be dimensionless, have an angular dependence on $\\theta/2$, and be normalized. The derived result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ meets all these criteria. We must find the option that matches this result.\n\n```python\ndef decide_final_answer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the quantum mechanics problem to determine the correct eigenvector.\n    This function codifies the reasoning based on the unanimous mathematical derivation\n    and fundamental physical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis to determine the correct eigenvector:\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # 1.

A unit vector in this plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the positive z-axis. In Cartesian coordinates, this unit vector is:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n2.  **Construct the Operator $P_n$**:\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Since the y-component of $\\vec{n}$ is zero ($n_y = 0$), the expression simplifies to:\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    Substituting the matrix forms of $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n    $P_n = \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    Combining the matrices gives the final operator:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Set Up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**:\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Substituting the operator and eigenvalue:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the constant factor of $\\hbar/2$ from both sides. This leaves a system of two linear equations. From the first equation, we can solve for the ratio of the components $b/a$:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n4.  **Simplify and Normalize the Eigenvector**:\n    Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$), we can simplify the ratio:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    This relationship implies the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    To normalize the eigenvector, we must ensure its norm (length) is 1. The squared norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components:\n    Norm$^2 = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n    Since the norm is already 1, the vector is normalized. The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Mathematical Correctness**: The derivation steps are standard for this type of quantum mechanics problem. The use of the Pauli matrices, the dot product with the direction vector, and the simplification using half-angle identities are all correct. The mathematical result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ is robust and unanimously agreed upon by all candidate agents.\n2.  **Dimensionality**: Eigenvectors representing quantum states are dimensionless vectors in a Hilbert space. The physical units are carried by the eigenvalues. Therefore, any option containing the constant $\\hbar$ is dimensionally incorrect. This immediately eliminates options A and B.\n3.  **Angular Dependence**: The calculation clearly shows that the components of the eigenvector depend on the half-angle, $\\theta/2$, not the full angle $\\theta$. This is a characteristic feature of spin-1/2 systems. This eliminates option D.\n4.  **Normalization**: The final eigenvector must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components must equal 1. The result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ satisfies this condition, as $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n5.  **Source of Discrepancy in Candidate Answers**: The candidate answers all perform the correct mathematical derivation. The wide disagreement on the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) indicates that the agents were working with inconsistent or scrambled lists of the multiple-choice options. The only valid approach is to match the correctly derived result to the specific list of options provided in the problem prompt.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe derived elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. We now compare this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect.

In Cartesian coordinates, this is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    *   **Operator $P_n$**: The operator for the component along $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$. Substituting the given matrices and the components of $\\vec{n}$ (with $n_y=0$):\n        $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n        Combining the matrices gives the final operator:\n        $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n    We need to solve the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The constant factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides.

To normalize this vector, we calculate the sum of the squares of its components:\n    $(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    The vector is already normalized. Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimity of Derivation**: All candidate answers correctly perform the mathematical derivation and arrive at the same result for the eigenvector's components: $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.

The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The constant factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides. The matrix equation expands to a system of linear equations. From the first row, we get:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n3.  **Determine the Eigenvector Components**\n    Rearranging the equation to find the ratio of the components:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta) \\implies \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$), the ratio simplifies significantly:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n4.  **Construct and Normalize the Eigenvector**\n    The relationship $b/a = \\tan(\\theta/2)$ implies the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. To normalize this vector, we calculate its magnitude (norm):\n    Norm = $\\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\n    The vector is already normalized. Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimity of Derivation**: All candidate answers correctly perform the mathematical derivation and arrive at the same result for the eigenvector's components: $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.

Finally, I will write a Python script that systematically applies these principles and the derived mathematical result to the specific options provided in the prompt, thereby determining the single correct answer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Mathematical Derivation (Consensus):** All candidate answers correctly perform the same derivation.\n    *   The operator for the spin component along a direction $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$ is constructed as $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ is set up with the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n    *   Solving the equation for the eigenvector components $(a, b)$ yields the ratio $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$.\n    *   Using trigonometric half-angle identities, this ratio simplifies to $\\frac{b}{a} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n    *   This implies the eigenvector is proportional to $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n    *   The norm of this vector is $\\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)} = 1$, so it is already normalized.\n    *   Therefore, the final mathematical result for the eigenvector components is **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n2.  **Careful Points for Evaluation:**\n    *   **Dimensionality:** A normalized eigenvector representing a quantum state is a dimensionless quantity. It is a vector in an abstract Hilbert space. The physical units are carried by the eigenvalues (like energy or momentum). Any option containing Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is dimensionally incorrect and must be eliminated.\n    *   **Angular Dependence:** The derivation clearly shows that the components of the eigenvector depend on the half-angle, $\\theta/2$. This is a characteristic feature of spin-1/2 systems. Any option with a different angular dependence (e.g., on $\\theta$) is incorrect.\n    *   **Source of Confusion:** The candidate answers show that the mathematical derivation is robust. The confusion arises solely from matching the correct result to a list of options that was apparently scrambled for different agents. The only valid procedure is to match the result to the options provided in the original question.\n\n3.  **Final Decision Logic:**\n    The correct choice must be dimensionless, have an angular dependence on $\\theta/2$, and be normalized. The derived result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ meets all these criteria. We must find the option that matches this result.\n\n```python\ndef decide_final_answer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the quantum mechanics problem to determine the correct eigenvector.\n    This function codifies the reasoning based on the unanimous mathematical derivation\n    and fundamental physical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis to determine the correct eigenvector:\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # 1.

A unit vector in this plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the positive z-axis. In Cartesian coordinates, this unit vector is:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n2.  **Construct the Operator $P_n$**:\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Since the y-component of $\\vec{n}$ is zero ($n_y = 0$), the expression simplifies to:\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    Substituting the matrix forms of $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n    $P_n = \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    Combining the matrices gives the final operator:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Set Up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**:\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Substituting the operator and eigenvalue:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the constant factor of $\\hbar/2$ from both sides. This leaves a system of two linear equations. From the first equation, we can solve for the ratio of the components $b/a$:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n4.  **Simplify and Normalize the Eigenvector**:\n    Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$), we can simplify the ratio:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    This relationship implies the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    To normalize the eigenvector, we must ensure its norm (length) is 1. The squared norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components:\n    Norm$^2 = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n    Since the norm is already 1, the vector is normalized. The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Mathematical Correctness**: The derivation steps are standard for this type of quantum mechanics problem. The use of the Pauli matrices, the dot product with the direction vector, and the simplification using half-angle identities are all correct. The mathematical result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ is robust and unanimously agreed upon by all candidate agents.\n2.  **Dimensionality**: Eigenvectors representing quantum states are dimensionless vectors in a Hilbert space. The physical units are carried by the eigenvalues. Therefore, any option containing the constant $\\hbar$ is dimensionally incorrect. This immediately eliminates options A and B.\n3.  **Angular Dependence**: The calculation clearly shows that the components of the eigenvector depend on the half-angle, $\\theta/2$, not the full angle $\\theta$. This is a characteristic feature of spin-1/2 systems. This eliminates option D.\n4.  **Normalization**: The final eigenvector must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components must equal 1. The result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ satisfies this condition, as $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n5.  **Source of Discrepancy in Candidate Answers**: The candidate answers all perform the correct mathematical derivation. The wide disagreement on the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) indicates that the agents were working with inconsistent or scrambled lists of the multiple-choice options. The only valid approach is to match the correctly derived result to the specific list of options provided in the problem prompt.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe derived elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. We now compare this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect.

It can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis: $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    *   **Dot Product**: The operator along this direction is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$.\n    *   Substituting the matrices and vector components gives:\n        $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n        $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**: We must solve the equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, where the eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and the eigenvalue is given as $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n    *   The equation is: $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The constant factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides. Expanding the first row of the matrix equation gives:\n        $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n3.  **Determine the Eigenvector Components**:\n    *   Rearranging the equation gives $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n    *   The ratio of the components is $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$.\n    *   Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$), the ratio simplifies to:\n        $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n4.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**:\n    *   The relationship $b/a = \\tan(\\theta/2)$ implies the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The norm (magnitude) of this vector is $\\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\n    *   The vector is already normalized.

This immediately eliminates options C and D.\n*   **Angular Dependence**: The calculation clearly shows the dependence is on the half-angle, $\\theta/2$, not the full angle $\\theta$. This is a characteristic feature of spin-1/2 systems and eliminates option A.\n*   **Source of Error**: The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to them referencing different or scrambled lists of the multiple-choice options.
