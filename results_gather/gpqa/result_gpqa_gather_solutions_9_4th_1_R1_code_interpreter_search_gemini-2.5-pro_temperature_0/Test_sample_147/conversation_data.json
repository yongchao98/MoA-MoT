All candidate answers correctly identify the core logic, even if some make errors in the final letter selection. The most consistent and chemically sound solution is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Potential Candidates for Element Y**\nThe first quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. For a compound YFₙ, the molar mass of Y can be estimated. This leads to several candidates, including Krypton (Kr), Antimony (Sb), and heavy metals like Platinum (Pt).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates Against Key Clues**\nThe qualitative clues are more definitive and allow for the elimination of incorrect hypotheses.\n*   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong clue. Platinum (Pt) is known to form five distinct binary fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). This fact strongly disfavors Krypton and Antimony, which do not have five well-established binary fluorides.\n*   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"** This is a unique chemical \"fingerprint.\" Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect match for A1 and makes the identification of **Y = Platinum (Pt)** and **A1 = PtF₆** extremely likely.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Remaining Compounds**\nWith Y identified as Platinum, the other compounds fall into place.\n*   A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **A2 = PtF₅**. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   The most restrictive clue is the reaction: `Y + A4 → A5` in a **1:1 molar ratio**. This points to a specific comproportionation reaction. For Platinum, the reaction **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF** perfectly fits this 1:1 stoichiometry of reactants.\n*   This reaction allows for the unambiguous identification of **A4 = PtF₂**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4, which we have identified as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol must be matched to the given options:\nA) 110-130\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a systematic evaluation of several hypotheses against a series of clues. The most consistent and logical solution is derived by identifying the unknown element Y that best fits all the provided chemical facts.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Initial Analysis and Candidate Identification**\nThe first quantitative clue is that substance A2, a fluoride of element Y with the formula YFₙ, has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. We can estimate the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) using the formula:\nM(Y) = M(F) * n * (1 - ωF) / ωF = 19.00 * n * (1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45 * n.\n\nThis calculation provides several potential candidates for Y:\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This suggests **Krypton (Kr)**.\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**.\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. This suggests a heavy metal like **Platinum (Pt)**.\n*   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Plutonium (Pu)**.\n\n**2. Evaluating Candidates Against Key Chemical Clues**\nThe qualitative clues are more restrictive and are crucial for identifying the correct element.\n\n*   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n    *   This is a very strong clue. Antimony (only two common fluorides) and Krypton (only one stable fluoride) fail this test.\n    *   **Platinum (Pt)** is known to form exactly five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"**\n    *   This is a unique chemical \"fingerprint\". **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)** is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first chemical to oxidize xenon. This provides overwhelming evidence that **Y = Platinum** and **A1 = PtF₆**.\n    *   The corresponding compounds for the other hypotheses do not match this description.\n\n**3. Building the Full Chemical Story with Y = Platinum**\nSince the evidence for Platinum is exceptionally strong, we can use it to identify the other substances.\n*   **Y = Platinum (Pt)**\n*   **A1 = PtF₆** (Matches color, instability, and reactivity with xenon).\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **PtF₅**. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The reaction is `Y + A4 → A5` in a **1:1 molar ratio**. This describes a comproportionation reaction. The only known reaction for platinum fluorides that fits this 1:1 reactant stoichiometry is:\n    **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**\n*   This reaction definitively identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n\nThis Platinum-based hypothesis is the only one that consistently explains the number of compounds, the specific properties of A1, and the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The minor inconsistency regarding A4 being in a \"solution\" (when PtF₂ is insoluble) is likely a simplification in the problem statement and is far less significant than the fundamental chemical contradictions of the other hypotheses.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance **A4**. From our deduction, A4 is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**5. Selecting the Correct Range**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**. This corresponds to option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to analyze the provided answers to find the most logical and consistent line of reasoning. I will then use this reasoning to write a Python script that confirms the final calculation and selects the correct answer choice.\n\n1.  **Synthesize the Reasoning:** All candidate answers converge on the hypothesis that element Y is Platinum (Pt). This conclusion is strongly supported by two key clues:\n    *   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** Platinum is famous for forming five such compounds (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). Other candidates like Krypton or Antimony fail this test.\n    *   **\"The bright-red substance A1... oxidizes xenon.\"** This is a classic description of Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆), a historically significant compound.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A4:** Following the Platinum hypothesis, the clue about the 1:1 molar ratio reaction (`Y + A4 → A5`) is best explained by the comproportionation reaction `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`. This step consistently identifies substance A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n\n3.  **Calculate Molecular Weight:** The final step is to calculate the molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) and determine which of the given ranges it falls into. Many of the provided answers correctly calculate the molecular weight but select the wrong letter due to re-ordering the options. My code will use the original option lettering.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the atomic weights of Platinum and Fluorine, calculate the molecular weight of PtF₂, and then programmatically select the correct range from the original options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the molecular weight of substance A4 based on a\n    step-by-step chemical deduction, as synthesized from the provided answers.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step deduction:\")\n    print(\"1.

This gives potential candidates:\n    *   n=2: Y ≈ 81 g/mol (e.g., Krypton, Kr)\n    *   n=3: Y ≈ 121 g/mol (e.g., Antimony, Sb)\n    *   n=5 or 6: Y is a heavy element (e.g., Platinum, Pt; Plutonium, Pu).\n\n*   **Clue 2: Five Binary Compounds**: This is a very restrictive clue. Platinum (Pt) is well-known to form five distinct binary fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). Other candidates like Kr and Sb do not have five well-established fluorides. This strongly favors Y = Pt.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Properties of A1**: A1 is a \"bright-red substance,\" \"decomposes at 293 K\" (room temperature), and \"oxidizes xenon.\" This is a classic chemical fingerprint for **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**. PtF₆ is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This makes the hypothesis Y=Pt and A1=PtF₆ extremely compelling.\n\n*   **Clue 4: The 1:1 Molar Ratio Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` occurs with a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants. This points to a specific comproportionation reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Hypotheses and Consolidate the Solution**\nThe Platinum hypothesis is the only one that consistently explains the most specific and restrictive clues.\n\n1.  **Identify Y**: The evidence overwhelmingly points to **Y = Platinum (Pt)**.\n2.  **Identify A1**: Based on its properties, **A1 = PtF₆**.\n3.  **Identify A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **A2 = PtF₅**. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n4.  **Identify A4**: The 1:1 reaction `Y + A4 → A5` must be `Pt + PtFₙ → A5`. The known reaction **`Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`** perfectly fits the 1:1 reactant stoichiometry. This allows us to definitively identify **A4 = PtF₂**.\n\nThis single, consistent hypothesis accounts for the existence of five distinct compounds (PtF₆, PtF₅, PtF₄, PtF₂, PtF) and all the major chemical behaviors described. Minor descriptive inconsistencies, such as A4 being in a \"solution\" when PtF₂ is insoluble, are likely simplifications in the problem statement and are outweighed by the strong evidence from reaction stoichiometry and unique chemical properties.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\nFrom the deduction, substance A4 is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol must be compared to the given ranges:\n\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe value 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **220-240**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a systematic deduction by evaluating several hypotheses against a series of clues. The most consistent solution is found by identifying the element Y that best fits all the chemical facts provided.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues and Formulate Hypotheses**\n\nFirst, we analyze the quantitative clue: substance A2, a binary fluoride with the formula YFₙ, has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. We can estimate the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) using the formula:\nM(Y) = M(F) × n × (1 - ωF) / ωF ≈ 19.00 × n × (0.6804 / 0.3196) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n\nThis calculation yields several potential candidates for Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidate: **Krypton (Kr)**.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: **Antimony (Sb)**.\n*   **n=5**: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. Candidate: **Platinum (Pt)**, whose molar mass is 195.1 g/mol, is a reasonable fit.\n\nNext, we must test these candidates against the qualitative clues, which are often more definitive.\n*   **Clue A: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong constraint.\n*   **Clue B: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"** This describes a very specific and powerful oxidizing agent.\n*   **Clue C: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a ... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This points to a specific comproportionation reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**: This fails quickly. Antimony only has two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. Also, its highest fluoride, SbF₅, is a stable, colorless liquid, not a red, unstable solid. This hypothesis is inconsistent.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis is attractive because the reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio clue. However, it has major flaws: Krypton does not have five known binary fluorides, and its most unstable fluoride, KrF₄, is a white/colorless solid, not \"bright-red\". This hypothesis is also inconsistent.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis provides the most consistent and comprehensive explanation.\n    1.  **Five Compounds**: Platinum is known to form exactly five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. This is a **perfect match**.\n    2.  **Properties of A1**: Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon (a landmark discovery by Neil Bartlett). This is a **perfect match** for A1.\n    3.  **Identity of A2**: If A1 is PtF₆, its decomposition product A2 is logically PtF₅. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    4.  **The 1:1 Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio is perfectly explained by the comproportionation reaction **`Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and Calculate its Molecular Weight**\n\nThe Platinum hypothesis is the only one that successfully aligns with the most specific and unique chemical clues. The minor inconsistency regarding A4 being in a \"solution\" (when PtF₂ is insoluble) is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement, which is common for such puzzles.\n\nBased on the deduction, the reaction is `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`. This identifies substance **A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n\nWe can now calculate its molecular weight:\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol must be compared to the given ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nThe value 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a systematic evaluation of different hypotheses against a series of clues. The most plausible solution is found by identifying the element Y that provides the most consistent explanation across all clues, even if minor contradictions exist.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis and Candidate Identification**\nThe first quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. For a compound with the formula YFₙ, the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) can be estimated using the formula: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n. This calculation yields several potential candidates for Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidate: **Krypton (Kr)**.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: **Antimony (Sb)**.\n*   **n=5 or 6**: M(Y) is in the range of heavy metals. A plausible candidate is **Platinum (Pt)**. For PtF₅, the theoretical ωF is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given value.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating Candidates Against Key Chemical Clues**\nThe qualitative clues are more definitive and must be used to test the candidates.\n\n*   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** Fails. Only two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅) are known.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Fails. Only one stable fluoride (KrF₂) and one highly unstable one (KrF₄) are well-established.\n    *   **Platinum (Pt):** **Perfect match.** Platinum is known to form five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. This clue strongly favors Platinum.\n\n*   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"**\n    *   This is a very strong \"fingerprint\" clue. **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)** is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first chemical to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect match for A1, strongly suggesting **Y = Pt** and **A1 = PtF₆**.\n    *   The candidates from the other hypotheses do not fit. KrF₄ is a white solid. SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid.\n\n**Step 3: Building the Full Picture with Y = Platinum**\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to Y being Platinum. We can use this to identify the other substances.\n*   **Y = Platinum (Pt)**\n*   **A1 = PtF₆** (Matches color, instability, and oxidizing power).\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **PtF₅**. The theoretical ωF for PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The reaction is \"Y + A4 → A5\" in a **1:1 molar ratio**. This describes a comproportionation reaction. With the remaining known fluorides (PtF₄, PtF₂, PtF), the only reaction that fits the 1:1 reactant stoichiometry is:\n    **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**\n*   This reaction definitively identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n\nThis Platinum-based hypothesis is the only one that consistently explains the number of compounds, the specific properties of A1, and the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The minor contradiction that PtF₂ is an insoluble solid, not something that forms a \"solution,\" is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement and is less significant than the fundamental chemical facts that are satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\nFrom our deduction, substance A4 is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**. Comparing this to the options provided in the problem description:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a systematic chemical deduction by evaluating several hypotheses against a series of clues. The most consistent and logical solution identifies the unknown element Y and its compounds.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial Candidate Identification**: The clue that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96% allows for the estimation of the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) for a compound YFₙ. This points to several initial candidates:\n    *   Krypton (Kr) if n=2.\n    *   Antimony (Sb) if n=3.\n    *   A heavy element like Platinum (Pt) or Plutonium (Pu) if n is 5 or 6.\n\n2.  **Evaluation Against Key Clues**: The candidates must be tested against the more specific and restrictive clues.\n    *   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong filter. Platinum (Pt) is known to form exactly five binary fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). This fact makes the hypotheses for Krypton and Antimony, which do not have five well-established fluorides, highly unlikely.\n    *   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K... and oxidizes xenon.\"** This is a unique chemical \"fingerprint\". Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This provides overwhelming evidence that **Y is Platinum (Pt)** and **A1 is PtF₆**.\n    *   **Clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This describes a reaction with a specific 1:1 stoichiometry of reactants. For the Platinum hypothesis, the comproportionation reaction **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF** perfectly fits this 1:1 ratio.\n\n3.  **Identification of Compounds**: Based on the Platinum hypothesis, which is the only one consistent with all major clues, we can identify the substances:\n    *   **Y**: Platinum (Pt)\n    *   **A1**: PtF₆\n    *   **A2**: The decomposition product of PtF₆ is logically PtF₅. The theoretical fluorine mass percentage in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **A4**: From the 1:1 reaction `Pt + A4 → A5`, we identify **A4 as PtF₂**.\n    *   **A5**: The product of the 1:1 reaction is PtF.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. We have confidently identified A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n    *   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol.\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range**: The calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240.

The consensus among the provided analyses points towards a single, most plausible hypothesis.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the logical deduction:\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Candidates for Element Y**: The clue that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96% allows for the estimation of the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) for a compound YFₙ. This leads to several initial candidates, including Krypton (Kr), Antimony (Sb), and heavy metals like Platinum (Pt).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates Against Key Clues**: The candidates must be tested against the more specific and restrictive clues:\n    *   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong filter. Platinum (Pt) is known to form five such compounds (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). This clue immediately disfavors Krypton and Antimony, which do not have five well-established binary fluorides.\n    *   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"** This is a unique chemical \"fingerprint\". Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This provides a near-perfect match, strongly identifying **Y = Platinum (Pt)** and **A1 = PtF₆**. The other candidates' fluorides do not match this description.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identity of A4**: With Y identified as Platinum, the remaining clues fall into place.\n    *   The decomposition of A1 (PtF₆) into A2 and fluorine suggests **A2 = PtF₅**. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   The most crucial clue for identifying A4 is the reaction: `Y + A4 → A5` in a **1:1 molar ratio**. For Platinum, this points to a specific comproportionation reaction: **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**. This reaction perfectly fits the 1:1 stoichiometry of the reactants (Y and A4).\n    *   This reaction allows for the unambiguous identification of substance **A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**:\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) is the sum of the atomic weights of one Platinum atom and two Fluorine atoms.\n    *   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range**: The calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 160-180\n    *   D) 220-240\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a systematic deduction based on a series of chemical clues to identify an unknown element Y and its compounds, ultimately leading to the molecular weight of substance A4.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the clues:\n\n1.  **Initial Analysis of Element Y**: The first quantitative clue is that substance A2, a fluoride of Y with the formula YFₙ, has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. This allows for the estimation of the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) using the formula: M(Y) = M(F) * n * (1 - ωF) / ωF.\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 81 g/mol (suggests Krypton, Kr).\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121 g/mol (suggests Antimony, Sb).\n    *   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202 g/mol (suggests a heavy metal like Platinum, Pt).\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 243 g/mol (suggests Plutonium, Pu).\n\n2.  **Evaluating Candidates Against Key Clues**: We must test these candidates against the other, more specific clues.\n    *   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong constraint. Platinum (Pt) is known to form five distinct binary fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). This fact strongly disfavors Krypton and Antimony, which do not have five well-established binary fluorides. This makes Platinum a prime candidate.\n    *   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"** This is a unique chemical \"fingerprint\". Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first chemical to oxidize xenon (a landmark discovery by Neil Bartlett). This is a near-perfect match for A1, strongly suggesting that **Y = Platinum (Pt)** and **A1 = PtF₆**.\n    *   **Clue: \"A1 decomposes... into A2...\"** If A1 is PtF₆, its decomposition product A2 is logically PtF₅. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, making this identification plausible.\n    *   **Clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a ... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This describes the reaction `Y + A4 → A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. This points to a specific comproportionation reaction. For Platinum, the reaction **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF** fits this 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly.\n\n3.  **Conclusion and Identification of A4**: The Platinum hypothesis is the only one that consistently explains the number of compounds, the specific properties of A1, and the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The other hypotheses fail on multiple fundamental points. The reaction `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` allows for the unambiguous identification of substance **A4 as PtF₂**.\n\n4.  **Calculation of Molecular Weight**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. We have identified A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n    *   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Selecting the Correct Range**: The calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **220-240**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a systematic evaluation of different hypotheses against a series of clues. The most plausible solution is found by identifying the element Y that provides the most consistent explanation across all clues, prioritizing the most specific and restrictive chemical facts.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues and Formulate Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2 (ωF = 31.96%)**: We can estimate the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) based on the formula of its fluoride, YFₙ. The formula M(Y) = M(F) * n * (1 - ωF) / ωF gives M(Y) ≈ 19.00 * n * (1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45 * n. This calculation suggests several potential candidates for Y:\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidate: **Krypton (Kr)**.\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: **Antimony (Sb)**.\n    *   n=5 or 6: M(Y) is in the range of heavy metals. A plausible candidate is **Platinum (Pt)**. For PtF₅, the theoretical ωF is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Five Binary Compounds**: This is a very strong constraint.\n    *   Krypton (Kr) and Antimony (Sb) fail this test, as they do not have five well-established binary fluorides.\n    *   **Platinum (Pt)** is a perfect match, as PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆ are all known.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Properties of A1**: A1 is described as a \"bright-red substance,\" which \"decomposes at 293 K\" (room temperature) and \"oxidizes xenon.\" This is a unique chemical fingerprint that points directly to **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**. PtF₆ is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first compound used to oxidize xenon, leading to the discovery of noble gas chemistry. This makes the hypothesis that **Y = Platinum (Pt)** and **A1 = PtF₆** extremely strong.\n\n*   **Clue 4: The 1:1 Molar Ratio Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` occurs with a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants. This indicates a specific comproportionation reaction. For the Platinum hypothesis, we can test the remaining known fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄). The reaction **`Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`** fits the 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the Platinum Hypothesis**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports the identification of Y as Platinum. The Platinum hypothesis is the only one that successfully accounts for the existence of five distinct compounds and all the specific chemical reactions described.\n*   **Y** = Platinum (Pt)\n*   **A1** = **PtF₆** (Matches the color, instability, and unique reactivity with xenon).\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes to A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **PtF₅**.\n*   **A4 & A5**: The 1:1 reaction `Pt + A4 → A5` is best explained by `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`. This identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n\nThis hypothesis provides a distinct identity for all five known fluorides of platinum, creating a fully consistent chemical story. The minor discrepancy in the mass percentage and the description of A4 being in a \"solution\" (when PtF₂ is insoluble) are likely inaccuracies in the problem statement, which is common for such puzzles. The fundamental chemical evidence is far more compelling.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the most consistent deduction, substance A4 is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**. We will now calculate its molecular weight.\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**. Comparing this to the options:\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction, weighing multiple, sometimes contradictory, clues to find the most consistent solution.\n\n**1. Initial Analysis and Candidate Identification**\nThe first quantitative clue is that substance A2 (a fluoride of element Y, with formula YFₙ) has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. We can estimate the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) using the formula: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\nThis calculation yields several potential candidates for Y:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidate: **Krypton (Kr)**.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: **Antimony (Sb)**.\n*   n=5 or 6: M(Y) is in the range of heavy metals. A plausible candidate is **Platinum (Pt)**, as PtF₅ has a fluorine mass percentage of ~32.75%, which is reasonably close.\n\n**2. Evaluating Candidates Against Key Chemical Clues**\nWe must test these candidates against the other, more qualitative clues, which are often more definitive in chemical puzzles.\n\n*   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** Fails. Only two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅) are known.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Fails. Only one stable fluoride (KrF₂) and one highly unstable one (KrF₄) are well-established.\n    *   **Platinum (Pt):** **Perfect match.** Platinum is known to form five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆.\n\n*   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"**\n    *   This is a very strong \"fingerprint\" clue. **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)** is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first chemical to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect match for A1, strongly suggesting **Y = Pt**.\n    *   The candidates from the other hypotheses do not fit. KrF₄ is a white solid. SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid.\n\n**3. Building the Full Picture with Y = Platinum**\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to Y being Platinum. Let's use this to identify the other substances.\n*   **Y = Platinum (Pt)**\n*   **A1 = PtF₆** (Matches color, instability, and oxidizing power).\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **PtF₅**. The theoretical ωF for PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The reaction is \"Y + A4 → A5\" in a **1:1 molar ratio**. This describes a comproportionation reaction. With the remaining known fluorides (PtF₄, PtF₂, PtF), the only reaction that fits the 1:1 reactant stoichiometry is:\n    **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**\n*   This reaction definitively identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n\nThis Platinum-based hypothesis is the only one that consistently explains the number of compounds, the specific properties of A1, and the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The minor contradiction regarding A4 being in a \"solution\" (PtF₂ is insoluble) is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement, which is less significant than the fundamental chemical facts that are satisfied.\n\n**4. Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\nFrom our deduction, substance A4 is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n```python\n# Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt)\nM_Pt = 195.08\n# Atomic weight of Fluorine (F)\nM_F = 19.00\n\n# Molecular weight of A4 (PtF2) = M(Pt) + 2 * M(F)\nmw_A4 = M_Pt + 2 * M_F\n\nprint(f\"The molecular weight of A4 (PtF2) is: {mw_A4:.2f} g/mol\")\n```\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**.\n\n**5.

This clue strongly favors Platinum.\n\n    *   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"**\n        *   This is a very specific chemical \"fingerprint\". **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)** is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a near-perfect match for A1, making the hypothesis **Y = Pt** and **A1 = PtF₆** extremely compelling.\n        *   The corresponding compounds for the other candidates do not match. KrF₄ is a colorless solid, and SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid.\n\n3.  **Consolidating the Platinum Hypothesis**: The evidence overwhelmingly points to Y being Platinum. We can now identify the other substances.\n    *   **Y = Platinum (Pt)**\n    *   **A1 = PtF₆**\n    *   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **PtF₅**. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: The reaction \"Y + A4 → A5\" occurs in a **1:1 molar ratio**.

This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a systematic evaluation of several hypotheses against a series of clues.

This calculation suggests several potential candidates for Y, most notably Krypton (Kr, for n=2), Antimony (Sb, for n=3), and a heavy element like Platinum (Pt, for n=5, where the theoretical ωF is a reasonable ~32.75%).\n\n*   **Clue 2: Five Binary Compounds**: This is a very strong clue. It suggests an element with a rich and varied fluoride chemistry.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Properties of A1**: A1 is described as a \"bright-red substance,\" which \"decomposes at 293 K\" (room temperature) and \"oxidizes xenon.\" This is a unique chemical fingerprint for a highly unstable and powerful oxidizing agent.\n\n*   **Clue 4: The 1:1 Molar Ratio Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` occurs with a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants. This is a very specific stoichiometric constraint, likely indicating a comproportionation reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating the Hypotheses**\n\nWe must test the most likely candidates (Krypton, Antimony, Platinum) against all the clues to find the most consistent fit.\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis fails on multiple critical points. Antimony only has two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. Furthermore, A1 would have to be SbF₅, which is a stable, colorless liquid, not a red, unstable solid. The known reaction `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃` does not have the required 1:1 molar ratio. This hypothesis is incorrect.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis is attractive because the reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio clue. However, it has two major flaws: Krypton does not have five well-established binary fluorides, and its most unstable fluoride, KrF₄, is a white/colorless solid, not \"bright-red\". This hypothesis is inconsistent with key descriptive clues.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis provides the most robust and consistent explanation for all the clues.\n    1.  **Five Binary Compounds**: Platinum is known to form exactly five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆.

We have identified A4 as **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n\n    *   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Selecting the Correct Range:**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**. This corresponds to option C in the original list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a systematic evaluation of several hypotheses against a series of clues. The most logical and consistent solution emerges by prioritizing the most specific and restrictive chemical facts.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis and Hypothesis Generation**\nThe first quantitative clue is that substance A2, a binary fluoride with the formula YFₙ, has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. The molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) can be estimated using the formula: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n. This leads to several potential candidates for element Y:\n*   **Krypton (Kr)**, for n=2 (M(Y) ≈ 81 g/mol)\n*   **Antimony (Sb)**, for n=3 (M(Y) ≈ 121 g/mol)\n*   **Platinum (Pt)**, for n=5 (M(Y) ≈ 202 g/mol; the theoretical ωF for PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given value).\n\n**Step 2: Systematic Evaluation of Hypotheses**\nWe must test these candidates against the other, more definitive qualitative clues.\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** This hypothesis is quickly invalidated.\n    *   It fails the \"five binary compounds\" test, as only two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅) are known.\n    *   A1 would have to be SbF₅, which is a stable, colorless liquid, not a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes at room temperature.\n    *   The known reaction `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃` does not have the required 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis:** This hypothesis is initially attractive but has fatal flaws.\n    *   **Pro:** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio clue, which would identify A4 as KrF₄.\n    *   **Cons:** Krypton does not have five well-established binary fluorides. More importantly, A1 would have to be KrF₄, which is a colorless/white solid, directly contradicting the \"bright-red substance\" description.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis:** This hypothesis provides the most consistent and comprehensive explanation.\n    *   **Clue 1 (\"Five binary compounds\"):** This is a perfect match. Platinum is known to form five distinct binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆.\n    *   **Clue 2 (\"Properties of A1\"):** This is a perfect match. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" and \"oxidizes xenon\" is a classic chemical fingerprint for **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**.\n    *   **Clue 3 (\"Decomposition of A1\"):** If A1 is PtF₆, its decomposition into A2 and fluorine logically yields **A2 = PtF₅**. As noted earlier, the mass percentage is a reasonable fit.\n    *   **Clue 4 (\"1:1 Molar Ratio\"):** The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio is perfectly explained by the comproportionation reaction **`Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion and Identification of A4**\nThe Platinum hypothesis is the only one that successfully aligns with the most specific and unique chemical clues (the number of fluorides, the iconic properties of A1, and the reaction stoichiometry). The minor inconsistency regarding A4 being in a \"solution\" (when PtF₂ is insoluble) is likely a simplification in the problem statement and is far less significant than the fundamental chemical contradictions of the other hypotheses.\nFrom the 1:1 reaction, we can definitively identify substance **A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of Molecular Weight**\nWe now calculate the molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂).\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nThe correct range is 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "This is a chemical puzzle that requires a systematic, step-by-step deduction based on the provided clues. The consensus among the candidate answers points to a single, robust logical path.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong clue. It points to an element with a rich and varied fluoride chemistry.\n*   **Clue 2: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2... and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"** This is a unique chemical \"fingerprint\". The combination of being a red, thermally unstable solid and a powerful enough oxidizing agent to react with xenon is famously characteristic of **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**. This discovery by Neil Bartlett in 1962 opened the field of noble gas chemistry.\n*   **Conclusion for Y:** The identification of A1 as PtF₆ strongly implies that **element Y is Platinum (Pt)**. This hypothesis is perfectly consistent with the first clue, as Platinum is known to form exactly five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. Other candidates derived from the mass percentage clue (like Krypton or Antimony) fail to satisfy these two critical conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Specific Compounds**\n\nWith Y identified as Platinum, we can deduce the identities of the other compounds.\n*   **A1 = PtF₆**: Identified from its unique chemical properties.\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical decomposition product is **A2 = PtF₅**. We can check this against the mass percentage clue (ωF=31.96%). The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is (5 * 19.00) / (195.08 + 5 * 19.00) ≈ 32.75%. This is reasonably close to the experimental value given in the problem.\n*   **A4**: The crucial clue is the reaction: `Y + A4 → A5` in a **1:1 molar ratio**. Substituting Y with Pt, the reaction is `Pt + A4 → A5`. This describes a comproportionation reaction. Looking at the remaining known fluorides of platinum (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄), the only reaction that fits a 1:1 reactant stoichiometry is:\n    **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**\n*   This reaction allows for the unambiguous identification of substance **A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nThe question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls. We have identified A4 as PtF₂.\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = (Atomic weight of Pt) + 2 * (Atomic weight of F)\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol must be matched to the given options:\nA) 110-130\nB) 220-240\nC) 160-180\nD) 140-160\n\nThe value 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>"

All candidate answers correctly identify the core logic, even if some make errors in the final letter selection. The most consistent and chemically sound solution is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Potential Candidates for Element Y**\nThe first quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. For a compound YFₙ, the molar mass of Y can be estimated. This leads to several candidates, including Krypton (Kr), Antimony (Sb), and heavy metals like Platinum (Pt).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates Against Key Clues**\nThe qualitative clues are more definitive and allow for the elimination of incorrect hypotheses.\n*   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong clue. Platinum (Pt) is known to form five distinct binary fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). This fact strongly disfavors Krypton and Antimony, which do not have five well-established binary fluorides.\n*   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"** This is a unique chemical \"fingerprint.\" Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect match for A1 and makes the identification of **Y = Platinum (Pt)** and **A1 = PtF₆** extremely likely.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Remaining Compounds**\nWith Y identified as Platinum, the other compounds fall into place.\n*   A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **A2 = PtF₅**. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   The most restrictive clue is the reaction: `Y + A4 → A5` in a **1:1 molar ratio**.

The most consistent and logical solution is derived by identifying the unknown element Y that best fits all the provided chemical facts.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Initial Analysis and Candidate Identification**\nThe first quantitative clue is that substance A2, a fluoride of element Y with the formula YFₙ, has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. We can estimate the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) using the formula:\nM(Y) = M(F) * n * (1 - ωF) / ωF = 19.00 * n * (1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45 * n.\n\nThis calculation provides several potential candidates for Y:\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This suggests **Krypton (Kr)**.\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**.\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. This suggests a heavy metal like **Platinum (Pt)**.\n*   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Plutonium (Pu)**.\n\n**2. Evaluating Candidates Against Key Chemical Clues**\nThe qualitative clues are more restrictive and are crucial for identifying the correct element.\n\n*   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n    *   This is a very strong clue. Antimony (only two common fluorides) and Krypton (only one stable fluoride) fail this test.\n    *   **Platinum (Pt)** is known to form exactly five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"**\n    *   This is a unique chemical \"fingerprint\". **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)** is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first chemical to oxidize xenon. This provides overwhelming evidence that **Y = Platinum** and **A1 = PtF₆**.\n    *   The corresponding compounds for the other hypotheses do not match this description.\n\n**3. Building the Full Chemical Story with Y = Platinum**\nSince the evidence for Platinum is exceptionally strong, we can use it to identify the other substances.\n*   **Y = Platinum (Pt)**\n*   **A1 = PtF₆** (Matches color, instability, and reactivity with xenon).\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **PtF₅**. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The reaction is `Y + A4 → A5` in a **1:1 molar ratio**. This describes a comproportionation reaction. The only known reaction for platinum fluorides that fits this 1:1 reactant stoichiometry is:\n    **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**\n*   This reaction definitively identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n\nThis Platinum-based hypothesis is the only one that consistently explains the number of compounds, the specific properties of A1, and the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The minor inconsistency regarding A4 being in a \"solution\" (when PtF₂ is insoluble) is likely a simplification in the problem statement and is far less significant than the fundamental chemical contradictions of the other hypotheses.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance **A4**. From our deduction, A4 is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**5.

I will then use this reasoning to write a Python script that confirms the final calculation and selects the correct answer choice.\n\n1.  **Synthesize the Reasoning:** All candidate answers converge on the hypothesis that element Y is Platinum (Pt). This conclusion is strongly supported by two key clues:\n    *   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** Platinum is famous for forming five such compounds (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆).

This gives potential candidates:\n    *   n=2: Y ≈ 81 g/mol (e.g., Krypton, Kr)\n    *   n=3: Y ≈ 121 g/mol (e.g., Antimony, Sb)\n    *   n=5 or 6: Y is a heavy element (e.g., Platinum, Pt; Plutonium, Pu).\n\n*   **Clue 2: Five Binary Compounds**: This is a very restrictive clue. Platinum (Pt) is well-known to form five distinct binary fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). Other candidates like Kr and Sb do not have five well-established fluorides. This strongly favors Y = Pt.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Properties of A1**: A1 is a \"bright-red substance,\" \"decomposes at 293 K\" (room temperature), and \"oxidizes xenon.\" This is a classic chemical fingerprint for **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**. PtF₆ is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This makes the hypothesis Y=Pt and A1=PtF₆ extremely compelling.\n\n*   **Clue 4: The 1:1 Molar Ratio Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` occurs with a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants. This points to a specific comproportionation reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Hypotheses and Consolidate the Solution**\nThe Platinum hypothesis is the only one that consistently explains the most specific and restrictive clues.\n\n1.  **Identify Y**: The evidence overwhelmingly points to **Y = Platinum (Pt)**.\n2.  **Identify A1**: Based on its properties, **A1 = PtF₆**.\n3.  **Identify A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **A2 = PtF₅**. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n4.  **Identify A4**: The 1:1 reaction `Y + A4 → A5` must be `Pt + PtFₙ → A5`. The known reaction **`Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`** perfectly fits the 1:1 reactant stoichiometry. This allows us to definitively identify **A4 = PtF₂**.\n\nThis single, consistent hypothesis accounts for the existence of five distinct compounds (PtF₆, PtF₅, PtF₄, PtF₂, PtF) and all the major chemical behaviors described. Minor descriptive inconsistencies, such as A4 being in a \"solution\" when PtF₂ is insoluble, are likely simplifications in the problem statement and are outweighed by the strong evidence from reaction stoichiometry and unique chemical properties.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\nFrom the deduction, substance A4 is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol must be compared to the given ranges:\n\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe value 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **220-240**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a systematic deduction by evaluating several hypotheses against a series of clues. The most consistent solution is found by identifying the element Y that best fits all the chemical facts provided.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues and Formulate Hypotheses**\n\nFirst, we analyze the quantitative clue: substance A2, a binary fluoride with the formula YFₙ, has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. We can estimate the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) using the formula:\nM(Y) = M(F) × n × (1 - ωF) / ωF ≈ 19.00 × n × (0.6804 / 0.3196) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n\nThis calculation yields several potential candidates for Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidate: **Krypton (Kr)**.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: **Antimony (Sb)**.\n*   **n=5**: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. Candidate: **Platinum (Pt)**, whose molar mass is 195.1 g/mol, is a reasonable fit.\n\nNext, we must test these candidates against the qualitative clues, which are often more definitive.\n*   **Clue A: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong constraint.\n*   **Clue B: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"** This describes a very specific and powerful oxidizing agent.\n*   **Clue C: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a ... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This points to a specific comproportionation reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**: This fails quickly. Antimony only has two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. Also, its highest fluoride, SbF₅, is a stable, colorless liquid, not a red, unstable solid. This hypothesis is inconsistent.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis is attractive because the reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio clue. However, it has major flaws: Krypton does not have five known binary fluorides, and its most unstable fluoride, KrF₄, is a white/colorless solid, not \"bright-red\". This hypothesis is also inconsistent.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis provides the most consistent and comprehensive explanation.\n    1.  **Five Compounds**: Platinum is known to form exactly five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. This is a **perfect match**.\n    2.  **Properties of A1**: Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon (a landmark discovery by Neil Bartlett). This is a **perfect match** for A1.\n    3.  **Identity of A2**: If A1 is PtF₆, its decomposition product A2 is logically PtF₅. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    4.  **The 1:1 Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio is perfectly explained by the comproportionation reaction **`Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and Calculate its Molecular Weight**\n\nThe Platinum hypothesis is the only one that successfully aligns with the most specific and unique chemical clues. The minor inconsistency regarding A4 being in a \"solution\" (when PtF₂ is insoluble) is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement, which is common for such puzzles.\n\nBased on the deduction, the reaction is `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`. This identifies substance **A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n\nWe can now calculate its molecular weight:\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol must be compared to the given ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nThe value 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a systematic evaluation of different hypotheses against a series of clues. The most plausible solution is found by identifying the element Y that provides the most consistent explanation across all clues, even if minor contradictions exist.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis and Candidate Identification**\nThe first quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. For a compound with the formula YFₙ, the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) can be estimated using the formula: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n. This calculation yields several potential candidates for Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidate: **Krypton (Kr)**.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: **Antimony (Sb)**.\n*   **n=5 or 6**: M(Y) is in the range of heavy metals. A plausible candidate is **Platinum (Pt)**. For PtF₅, the theoretical ωF is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given value.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating Candidates Against Key Chemical Clues**\nThe qualitative clues are more definitive and must be used to test the candidates.\n\n*   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** Fails. Only two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅) are known.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Fails. Only one stable fluoride (KrF₂) and one highly unstable one (KrF₄) are well-established.\n    *   **Platinum (Pt):** **Perfect match.** Platinum is known to form five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. This clue strongly favors Platinum.\n\n*   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"**\n    *   This is a very strong \"fingerprint\" clue. **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)** is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first chemical to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect match for A1, strongly suggesting **Y = Pt** and **A1 = PtF₆**.\n    *   The candidates from the other hypotheses do not fit. KrF₄ is a white solid. SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid.\n\n**Step 3: Building the Full Picture with Y = Platinum**\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to Y being Platinum. We can use this to identify the other substances.\n*   **Y = Platinum (Pt)**\n*   **A1 = PtF₆** (Matches color, instability, and oxidizing power).\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **PtF₅**. The theoretical ωF for PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The reaction is \"Y + A4 → A5\" in a **1:1 molar ratio**. This describes a comproportionation reaction. With the remaining known fluorides (PtF₄, PtF₂, PtF), the only reaction that fits the 1:1 reactant stoichiometry is:\n    **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**\n*   This reaction definitively identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n\nThis Platinum-based hypothesis is the only one that consistently explains the number of compounds, the specific properties of A1, and the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The minor contradiction that PtF₂ is an insoluble solid, not something that forms a \"solution,\" is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement and is less significant than the fundamental chemical facts that are satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\nFrom our deduction, substance A4 is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**. Comparing this to the options provided in the problem description:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a systematic chemical deduction by evaluating several hypotheses against a series of clues.

Platinum (Pt) is known to form exactly five binary fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). This fact makes the hypotheses for Krypton and Antimony, which do not have five well-established fluorides, highly unlikely.\n    *   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K... and oxidizes xenon.\"** This is a unique chemical \"fingerprint\". Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This provides overwhelming evidence that **Y is Platinum (Pt)** and **A1 is PtF₆**.\n    *   **Clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This describes a reaction with a specific 1:1 stoichiometry of reactants. For the Platinum hypothesis, the comproportionation reaction **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF** perfectly fits this 1:1 ratio.\n\n3.  **Identification of Compounds**: Based on the Platinum hypothesis, which is the only one consistent with all major clues, we can identify the substances:\n    *   **Y**: Platinum (Pt)\n    *   **A1**: PtF₆\n    *   **A2**: The decomposition product of PtF₆ is logically PtF₅. The theoretical fluorine mass percentage in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **A4**: From the 1:1 reaction `Pt + A4 → A5`, we identify **A4 as PtF₂**.\n    *   **A5**: The product of the 1:1 reaction is PtF.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4.

The consensus among the provided analyses points towards a single, most plausible hypothesis.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the logical deduction:\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Candidates for Element Y**: The clue that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96% allows for the estimation of the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) for a compound YFₙ.

Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This provides a near-perfect match, strongly identifying **Y = Platinum (Pt)** and **A1 = PtF₆**. The other candidates' fluorides do not match this description.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identity of A4**: With Y identified as Platinum, the remaining clues fall into place.\n    *   The decomposition of A1 (PtF₆) into A2 and fluorine suggests **A2 = PtF₅**. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   The most crucial clue for identifying A4 is the reaction: `Y + A4 → A5` in a **1:1 molar ratio**.

This allows for the estimation of the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) using the formula: M(Y) = M(F) * n * (1 - ωF) / ωF.\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 81 g/mol (suggests Krypton, Kr).\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121 g/mol (suggests Antimony, Sb).\n    *   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202 g/mol (suggests a heavy metal like Platinum, Pt).\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 243 g/mol (suggests Plutonium, Pu).\n\n2.  **Evaluating Candidates Against Key Clues**: We must test these candidates against the other, more specific clues.\n    *   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong constraint. Platinum (Pt) is known to form five distinct binary fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). This fact strongly disfavors Krypton and Antimony, which do not have five well-established binary fluorides. This makes Platinum a prime candidate.\n    *   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K ... and oxidizes xenon.\"** This is a unique chemical \"fingerprint\". Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first chemical to oxidize xenon (a landmark discovery by Neil Bartlett).

The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, making this identification plausible.\n    *   **Clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a ... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This describes the reaction `Y + A4 → A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. This points to a specific comproportionation reaction. For Platinum, the reaction **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF** fits this 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly.\n\n3.  **Conclusion and Identification of A4**: The Platinum hypothesis is the only one that consistently explains the number of compounds, the specific properties of A1, and the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The other hypotheses fail on multiple fundamental points. The reaction `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` allows for the unambiguous identification of substance **A4 as PtF₂**.\n\n4.  **Calculation of Molecular Weight**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. We have identified A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n    *   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Selecting the Correct Range**: The calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **220-240**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a systematic evaluation of different hypotheses against a series of clues. The most plausible solution is found by identifying the element Y that provides the most consistent explanation across all clues, prioritizing the most specific and restrictive chemical facts.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues and Formulate Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2 (ωF = 31.96%)**: We can estimate the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) based on the formula of its fluoride, YFₙ. The formula M(Y) = M(F) * n * (1 - ωF) / ωF gives M(Y) ≈ 19.00 * n * (1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45 * n. This calculation suggests several potential candidates for Y:\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidate: **Krypton (Kr)**.\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: **Antimony (Sb)**.\n    *   n=5 or 6: M(Y) is in the range of heavy metals. A plausible candidate is **Platinum (Pt)**. For PtF₅, the theoretical ωF is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Five Binary Compounds**: This is a very strong constraint.\n    *   Krypton (Kr) and Antimony (Sb) fail this test, as they do not have five well-established binary fluorides.\n    *   **Platinum (Pt)** is a perfect match, as PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆ are all known.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Properties of A1**: A1 is described as a \"bright-red substance,\" which \"decomposes at 293 K\" (room temperature) and \"oxidizes xenon.\" This is a unique chemical fingerprint that points directly to **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**. PtF₆ is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first compound used to oxidize xenon, leading to the discovery of noble gas chemistry. This makes the hypothesis that **Y = Platinum (Pt)** and **A1 = PtF₆** extremely strong.\n\n*   **Clue 4: The 1:1 Molar Ratio Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` occurs with a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants. This indicates a specific comproportionation reaction. For the Platinum hypothesis, we can test the remaining known fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄). The reaction **`Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`** fits the 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the Platinum Hypothesis**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports the identification of Y as Platinum. The Platinum hypothesis is the only one that successfully accounts for the existence of five distinct compounds and all the specific chemical reactions described.\n*   **Y** = Platinum (Pt)\n*   **A1** = **PtF₆** (Matches the color, instability, and unique reactivity with xenon).\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes to A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **PtF₅**.\n*   **A4 & A5**: The 1:1 reaction `Pt + A4 → A5` is best explained by `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`. This identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n\nThis hypothesis provides a distinct identity for all five known fluorides of platinum, creating a fully consistent chemical story. The minor discrepancy in the mass percentage and the description of A4 being in a \"solution\" (when PtF₂ is insoluble) are likely inaccuracies in the problem statement, which is common for such puzzles. The fundamental chemical evidence is far more compelling.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the most consistent deduction, substance A4 is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**. We will now calculate its molecular weight.\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**. Comparing this to the options:\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction, weighing multiple, sometimes contradictory, clues to find the most consistent solution.\n\n**1.

This is a perfect match for A1, strongly suggesting **Y = Pt**.\n    *   The candidates from the other hypotheses do not fit. KrF₄ is a white solid. SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid.\n\n**3. Building the Full Picture with Y = Platinum**\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to Y being Platinum. Let's use this to identify the other substances.\n*   **Y = Platinum (Pt)**\n*   **A1 = PtF₆** (Matches color, instability, and oxidizing power).\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The logical product is **PtF₅**. The theoretical ωF for PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The reaction is \"Y + A4 → A5\" in a **1:1 molar ratio**. This describes a comproportionation reaction. With the remaining known fluorides (PtF₄, PtF₂, PtF), the only reaction that fits the 1:1 reactant stoichiometry is:\n    **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**\n*   This reaction definitively identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n\nThis Platinum-based hypothesis is the only one that consistently explains the number of compounds, the specific properties of A1, and the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry.

This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a systematic evaluation of several hypotheses against a series of clues. The most logical solution is found by identifying the element Y that provides the most consistent explanation across all clues, prioritizing specific chemical facts over minor descriptive inconsistencies.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis and Candidate Identification**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2 (ωF = 31.96%)**: For a compound with the formula YFₙ, we can estimate the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) using the formula: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n. This calculation suggests several potential candidates for Y, most notably Krypton (Kr, for n=2), Antimony (Sb, for n=3), and a heavy element like Platinum (Pt, for n=5, where the theoretical ωF is a reasonable ~32.75%).\n\n*   **Clue 2: Five Binary Compounds**: This is a very strong clue. It suggests an element with a rich and varied fluoride chemistry.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Properties of A1**: A1 is described as a \"bright-red substance,\" which \"decomposes at 293 K\" (room temperature) and \"oxidizes xenon.\" This is a unique chemical fingerprint for a highly unstable and powerful oxidizing agent.\n\n*   **Clue 4: The 1:1 Molar Ratio Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` occurs with a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants. This is a very specific stoichiometric constraint, likely indicating a comproportionation reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating the Hypotheses**\n\nWe must test the most likely candidates (Krypton, Antimony, Platinum) against all the clues to find the most consistent fit.\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis fails on multiple critical points. Antimony only has two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. Furthermore, A1 would have to be SbF₅, which is a stable, colorless liquid, not a red, unstable solid. The known reaction `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃` does not have the required 1:1 molar ratio. This hypothesis is incorrect.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis is attractive because the reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio clue. However, it has two major flaws: Krypton does not have five well-established binary fluorides, and its most unstable fluoride, KrF₄, is a white/colorless solid, not \"bright-red\". This hypothesis is inconsistent with key descriptive clues.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis provides the most robust and consistent explanation for all the clues.\n    1.  **Five Binary Compounds**: Platinum is known to form exactly five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. This is a perfect match.\n    2.  **Properties of A1**: Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a near-perfect match for the description of A1, allowing us to identify **A1 = PtF₆**.\n    3.  **Decomposition of A1**: If A1 (PtF₆) decomposes, the logical product A2 is PtF₅. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    4.  **The 1:1 Reaction**: The comproportionation reaction **`Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`** perfectly fits the 1:1 molar ratio of reactants (Y and A4).\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and Calculate its Molecular Weight**\n\nThe Platinum hypothesis is the only one that successfully aligns with the most specific and fundamental chemical clues. The 1:1 reaction `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` allows us to definitively identify substance **A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n\nWe can now calculate its molecular weight:\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 140-160\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a systematic chemical deduction by evaluating several hypotheses against a series of clues. The most consistent and logical solution is derived by identifying the unknown element Y that best fits all the given constraints.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial Candidate Identification from Mass Percentage:**\n    The problem states that substance A2, a binary fluoride with the formula YFₙ, has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. The molar mass of element Y, M(Y), can be estimated using the formula: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n (where n is the number of fluorine atoms).\n    *   For n=2, M(Y) ≈ 81 g/mol, suggesting Krypton (Kr).\n    *   For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121 g/mol, suggesting Antimony (Sb).\n    *   For n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202 g/mol, suggesting a heavy metal like Platinum (Pt).\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Candidates Against Key Clues:**\n    The qualitative clues are more definitive than the single mass percentage value. We must test the candidates against these.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This is a very strong constraint.\n        *   Antimony (Sb) and Krypton (Kr) fail this test, as they do not have five well-established binary fluorides.\n        *   **Platinum (Pt)** is a perfect match, as PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆ are all known compounds.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K... and oxidizes xenon.\"** This is a unique chemical \"fingerprint\".\n        *   **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)** is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable at room temperature, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a near-perfect match for A1, making the hypothesis that **Y = Platinum** extremely strong.\n        *   The corresponding compounds for the other candidates do not fit this description (e.g., KrF₄ is a white solid, SbF₅ is a stable colorless liquid).\n\n3.  **Consolidating the Platinum Hypothesis:**\n    The evidence overwhelmingly points to Y being Platinum. Using this, we can identify the other substances.\n    *   **Y = Platinum (Pt)**\n    *   **A1 = PtF₆** (matches color, instability, and reactivity with xenon).\n    *   **A2**: The decomposition product of A1 (PtF₆) is logically **A2 = PtF₅**. The theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` occurs in a **1:1 molar ratio**. This points to a specific comproportionation reaction. For platinum, the reaction **`Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`** perfectly fits this 1:1 stoichiometry of reactants.\n    *   This reaction allows for the unambiguous identification of **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion and Calculation:**\n    The Platinum hypothesis is the only one that provides a consistent explanation for the number of compounds, the specific chemical properties of A1, and the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The minor inconsistency regarding A4 being in a \"solution\" (PtF₂ is insoluble) is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement, which is common in such puzzles.\n\n    The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance **A4**. We have identified A4 as **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n\n    *   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Selecting the Correct Range:**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**. This corresponds to option C in the original list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a systematic evaluation of several hypotheses against a series of clues. The most logical and consistent solution emerges by prioritizing the most specific and restrictive chemical facts.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis and Hypothesis Generation**\nThe first quantitative clue is that substance A2, a binary fluoride with the formula YFₙ, has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. The molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) can be estimated using the formula: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n. This leads to several potential candidates for element Y:\n*   **Krypton (Kr)**, for n=2 (M(Y) ≈ 81 g/mol)\n*   **Antimony (Sb)**, for n=3 (M(Y) ≈ 121 g/mol)\n*   **Platinum (Pt)**, for n=5 (M(Y) ≈ 202 g/mol; the theoretical ωF for PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given value).\n\n**Step 2: Systematic Evaluation of Hypotheses**\nWe must test these candidates against the other, more definitive qualitative clues.\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** This hypothesis is quickly invalidated.\n    *   It fails the \"five binary compounds\" test, as only two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅) are known.\n    *   A1 would have to be SbF₅, which is a stable, colorless liquid, not a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes at room temperature.\n    *   The known reaction `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃` does not have the required 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis:** This hypothesis is initially attractive but has fatal flaws.\n    *   **Pro:** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio clue, which would identify A4 as KrF₄.\n    *   **Cons:** Krypton does not have five well-established binary fluorides. More importantly, A1 would have to be KrF₄, which is a colorless/white solid, directly contradicting the \"bright-red substance\" description.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis:** This hypothesis provides the most consistent and comprehensive explanation.\n    *   **Clue 1 (\"Five binary compounds\"):** This is a perfect match. Platinum is known to form five distinct binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆.\n    *   **Clue 2 (\"Properties of A1\"):** This is a perfect match. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" and \"oxidizes xenon\" is a classic chemical fingerprint for **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**.\n    *   **Clue 3 (\"Decomposition of A1\"):** If A1 is PtF₆, its decomposition into A2 and fluorine logically yields **A2 = PtF₅**. As noted earlier, the mass percentage is a reasonable fit.\n    *   **Clue 4 (\"1:1 Molar Ratio\"):** The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio is perfectly explained by the comproportionation reaction **`Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion and Identification of A4**\nThe Platinum hypothesis is the only one that successfully aligns with the most specific and unique chemical clues (the number of fluorides, the iconic properties of A1, and the reaction stoichiometry). The minor inconsistency regarding A4 being in a \"solution\" (when PtF₂ is insoluble) is likely a simplification in the problem statement and is far less significant than the fundamental chemical contradictions of the other hypotheses.\nFrom the 1:1 reaction, we can definitively identify substance **A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of Molecular Weight**\nWe now calculate the molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂).\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 × 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nThe correct range is 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
