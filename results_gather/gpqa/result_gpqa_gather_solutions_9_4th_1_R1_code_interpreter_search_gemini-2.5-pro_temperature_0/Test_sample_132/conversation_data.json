The primary discrepancy among the answers is the final letter choice, which stems from inconsistent multiple-choice option lists being used by the different agents. The following analysis uses the correct calculation and matches it to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations:**\n    The first step is to determine the molar concentrations of the two primary phosphate species in the solution: the weak acid dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻) from KH₂PO₄ and its conjugate base hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻) from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O.\n\n    *   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻:**\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   **Volume of Solution:**\n        200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   **Initial Concentrations:**\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The solution is a buffer, and its hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the equilibrium between the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This equilibrium is described by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₂.\n\n    *   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   **Equilibrium Expression:** Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\n    Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed in the next dissociation step, which involves the deprotonation of HPO₄²⁻. This equilibrium is described by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n\n    *   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   **Equilibrium Expression:** Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n    Rearranging to solve for the target concentration, [PO₄³⁻]:\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.

Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Subsequently, Ka₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the [PO₄³⁻] from the HPO₄²⁻ dissociation.\n*   **Volume Conversion:** The volume must be converted from cm³ to Liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L) for molarity calculations.\n*   **Buffer Approximation:** It is valid to use the initial calculated concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ in the equilibrium expressions because they are part of a buffer, and the dissociation constants are very small, meaning their concentrations do not change significantly.\n*   **Final Option Matching:** This is the most critical step and the source of confusion among the candidate answers. The calculated numerical value (~6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M) must be carefully matched against the specific list of options provided in the original question prompt.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the calculation methodology and the final numerical result. The discrepancies in the final lettered answers stem from the fact that the candidates were clearly working with different orderings of the multiple-choice options. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the options provided in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations of Buffer Components:**\n    The solution is a buffer composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Initial concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Initial concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the primary buffer equilibrium, which is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Equilibrium expression: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed in the third dissociation step, governed by Ka₃. We use the [H⁺] calculated from the main buffer equilibrium.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Equilibrium expression: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Substituting the known values:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n4.  **Final Answer Determination:**\n    The calculated concentration, 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M, is rounded to three significant figures, giving **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) **6.24x10⁻⁷ M**\n    *   B) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   C) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   D) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The calculated value matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrated Salt:** It is essential to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt as given (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, Mw = 177.99 g/mol) and not the anhydrous form. All candidate answers correctly identified this.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation must be performed in two distinct steps using the correct dissociation constants. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Then, Ka₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the [PO₄³⁻] from the HPO₄²⁻ dissociation. This two-step logic was correctly applied by all candidates.\n*   **Buffer Approximation:** The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations is valid. This is because the dissociation constants are small and the common ion effect from the buffer suppresses further dissociation.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Option:** The numerical calculation across all candidate answers was correct, consistently yielding ~6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. The discrepancies in the final lettered answers arose because the candidates were working with scrambled lists of options. The final, critical step is to match the calculated value to the specific options provided in the prompt.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to resolve the discrepancy among the candidate answers by performing an independent, step-by-step calculation. The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the calculation method but are confused about which lettered option corresponds to the correct numerical result. This suggests the agents may have been working with different or scrambled lists of options.\n\nMy approach will be:\n1.  **Systematic Calculation:** I will perform the two-step equilibrium calculation required to solve the problem. This involves first finding the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] from the primary buffer system (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻) and then using that value to find the concentration of the target ion (PO₄³⁻).\n2.  **Code Implementation:** I will use Python to carry out the calculations precisely, avoiding any manual rounding errors. The code will print out the intermediate and final results for clarity.\n3.  **Final Verification:** I will compare the final calculated value directly against the specific list of options provided in the original question prompt to determine the correct letter choice.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is essential to use the molar mass for the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation is a two-step process. Ka₂ (6.2x10⁻⁸) must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Subsequently, Ka₃ (1.8x10⁻¹²) must be used with that [H⁺] to find the final [PO₄³⁻].\n*   **Volume Conversion:** The volume must be converted from cm³ to Liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L) for molarity calculations.\n*   **Buffer Approximation:** It is valid to use the initial concentrations of the buffer components in the equilibrium expressions because the dissociation constants are very small, and the common ion effect suppresses dissociation.\n*   **Option Matching:** This is the most critical step. The final calculated value must be carefully compared against the original options (A, B, C, D) provided in the prompt to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_phosphate_buffer_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the buffer solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given Data ---\n    mass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\n    mw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\n    mass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\n    mw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\n    volume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # L\n\n    # Acid dissociation constants for H3PO4\n    Ka2 = 6.2e-8\n    Ka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations ---\n    # H2PO4- is the weak acid component\n    moles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n    conc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\n\n    # HPO4^2- is the conjugate base component\n    moles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n    conc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Initial Concentrations ---\")\n    print(f\"Initial [H2PO4-] = {conc_h2po4:.5f} M\")\n    print(f\"Initial [HPO4^2-] = {conc_hpo4:.5f} M\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+] ---\n    # The buffer equilibrium is H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-, governed by Ka2.\n    # [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    conc_h_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n    \n    print(\"--- Step 2: Hydrogen Ion Concentration ---\")\n    print(f\"Calculated [H+] = {conc_h_plus:.3e} M\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-] ---\n    # The final equilibrium is HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-, governed by Ka3.\n    # [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n    conc_po4 = (Ka3 * conc_hpo4) / conc_h_plus\n\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Final Orthophosphate Concentration ---\")\n    print(f\"Calculated [PO4^3-] = {conc_po4:.3e} M\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Compare with Original Options ---\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 3.97e-7,\n        \"B\": 2.81e-7,\n        \"C\": 5.48e-7,\n        \"D\": 6.24e-7\n    }\n    \n    print(\"--- Step 4: Final Answer Selection ---\")\n    print(\"Original Options:\")\n    print(f\"A) {options['A']:.2e} M\")\n    print(f\"B) {options['B']:.2e} M\")\n    print(f\"C) {options['C']:.2e} M\")\n    print(f\"D) {options['D']:.2e} M\")\n\n    # Find the best match by checking which option is closest to the calculated value\n    best_match_key = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - conc_po4))\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value {conc_po4:.3e} M rounds to {conc_po4:.2e} M.\")\n    print(f\"This value matches option {best_match_key}.\")\n\n# Run the calculation\nsolve_phosphate_buffer_problem()\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: --- Step 1: Initial Concentrations ---\nInitial [H2PO4-] = 0.03674 M\nInitial [HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M\n\n--- Step 2: Hydrogen Ion Concentration ---\nCalculated [H+] = 8.109e-08 M\n\n--- Step 3: Final Orthophosphate Concentration ---\nCalculated [PO4^3-] = 6.236e-07 M\n\n--- Step 4: Final Answer Selection ---\nOriginal Options:\nA) 3.97e-07 M\nB) 2.81e-07 M\nC) 5.48e-07 M\nD) 6.24e-07 M\n\nThe calculated value 6.236e-07 M rounds to 6.24e-07 M.\nThis value matches option D.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a two-step chemical equilibrium calculation to determine the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻).

This equilibrium is described by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₂.\n\n    *   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   **Equilibrium Expression:** Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\n    Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed in the next dissociation step, which involves the deprotonation of HPO₄²⁻. This equilibrium is described by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n\n    *   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   **Equilibrium Expression:** Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n    Rearranging to solve for the target concentration, [PO₄³⁻]:\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.

The discrepancies in the final lettered answers stem from the fact that the candidates were clearly working with different orderings of the multiple-choice options. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the options provided in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations of Buffer Components:**\n    The solution is a buffer composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Initial concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Initial concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the primary buffer equilibrium, which is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Equilibrium expression: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed in the third dissociation step, governed by Ka₃. We use the [H⁺] calculated from the main buffer equilibrium.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Equilibrium expression: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Substituting the known values:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n4.  **Final Answer Determination:**\n    The calculated concentration, 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M, is rounded to three significant figures, giving **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.

All candidate answers correctly identified this.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation must be performed in two distinct steps using the correct dissociation constants. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Then, Ka₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the [PO₄³⁻] from the HPO₄²⁻ dissociation. This two-step logic was correctly applied by all candidates.\n*   **Buffer Approximation:** The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations is valid. This is because the dissociation constants are small and the common ion effect from the buffer suppresses further dissociation.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Option:** The numerical calculation across all candidate answers was correct, consistently yielding ~6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. The discrepancies in the final lettered answers arose because the candidates were working with scrambled lists of options. The final, critical step is to match the calculated value to the specific options provided in the prompt.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to resolve the discrepancy among the candidate answers by performing an independent, step-by-step calculation. The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the calculation method but are confused about which lettered option corresponds to the correct numerical result. This suggests the agents may have been working with different or scrambled lists of options.\n\nMy approach will be:\n1.  **Systematic Calculation:** I will perform the two-step equilibrium calculation required to solve the problem. This involves first finding the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] from the primary buffer system (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻) and then using that value to find the concentration of the target ion (PO₄³⁻).\n2.  **Code Implementation:** I will use Python to carry out the calculations precisely, avoiding any manual rounding errors. The code will print out the intermediate and final results for clarity.\n3.  **Final Verification:** I will compare the final calculated value directly against the specific list of options provided in the original question prompt to determine the correct letter choice.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is essential to use the molar mass for the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation is a two-step process. Ka₂ (6.2x10⁻⁸) must be used to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Subsequently, Ka₃ (1.8x10⁻¹²) must be used with that [H⁺] to find the final [PO₄³⁻].\n*   **Volume Conversion:** The volume must be converted from cm³ to Liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L) for molarity calculations.\n*   **Buffer Approximation:** It is valid to use the initial concentrations of the buffer components in the equilibrium expressions because the dissociation constants are very small, and the common ion effect suppresses dissociation.\n*   **Option Matching:** This is the most critical step. The final calculated value must be carefully compared against the original options (A, B, C, D) provided in the prompt to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_phosphate_buffer_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the buffer solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given Data ---\n    mass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\n    mw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\n    mass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\n    mw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\n    volume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # L\n\n    # Acid dissociation constants for H3PO4\n    Ka2 = 6.2e-8\n    Ka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate Moles and Initial Concentrations ---\n    # H2PO4- is the weak acid component\n    moles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n    conc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\n\n    # HPO4^2- is the conjugate base component\n    moles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n    conc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Initial Concentrations ---\")\n    print(f\"Initial [H2PO4-] = {conc_h2po4:.5f} M\")\n    print(f\"Initial [HPO4^2-] = {conc_hpo4:.5f} M\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+] ---\n    # The buffer equilibrium is H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-, governed by Ka2.\n    # [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    conc_h_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n    \n    print(\"--- Step 2: Hydrogen Ion Concentration ---\")\n    print(f\"Calculated [H+] = {conc_h_plus:.3e} M\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-] ---\n    # The final equilibrium is HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-, governed by Ka3.\n    # [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n    conc_po4 = (Ka3 * conc_hpo4) / conc_h_plus\n\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Final Orthophosphate Concentration ---\")\n    print(f\"Calculated [PO4^3-] = {conc_po4:.3e} M\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Compare with Original Options ---\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 3.97e-7,\n        \"B\": 2.81e-7,\n        \"C\": 5.48e-7,\n        \"D\": 6.24e-7\n    }\n    \n    print(\"--- Step 4: Final Answer Selection ---\")\n    print(\"Original Options:\")\n    print(f\"A) {options['A']:.2e} M\")\n    print(f\"B) {options['B']:.2e} M\")\n    print(f\"C) {options['C']:.2e} M\")\n    print(f\"D) {options['D']:.2e} M\")\n\n    # Find the best match by checking which option is closest to the calculated value\n    best_match_key = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - conc_po4))\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value {conc_po4:.3e} M rounds to {conc_po4:.2e} M.\")\n    print(f\"This value matches option {best_match_key}.\")\n\n# Run the calculation\nsolve_phosphate_buffer_problem()\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: --- Step 1: Initial Concentrations ---\nInitial [H2PO4-] = 0.03674 M\nInitial [HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M\n\n--- Step 2: Hydrogen Ion Concentration ---\nCalculated [H+] = 8.109e-08 M\n\n--- Step 3: Final Orthophosphate Concentration ---\nCalculated [PO4^3-] = 6.236e-07 M\n\n--- Step 4: Final Answer Selection ---\nOriginal Options:\nA) 3.97e-07 M\nB) 2.81e-07 M\nC) 5.48e-07 M\nD) 6.24e-07 M\n\nThe calculated value 6.236e-07 M rounds to 6.24e-07 M.\nThis value matches option D.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a two-step chemical equilibrium calculation to determine the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻).

This two-step logic is crucial and was correctly applied by all candidates.\n*   **Buffer Approximation**: The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations is valid.
