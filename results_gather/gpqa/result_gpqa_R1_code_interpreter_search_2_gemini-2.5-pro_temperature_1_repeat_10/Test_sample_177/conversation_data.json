    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and determine the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n**1. Mass Dimensions of Fields and Lagrangian in Natural Units**\n\nIn natural units, where $\\hbar = c = 1$, mass has the dimension of energy, and length has the dimension of inverse mass. The action $S$ is a dimensionless quantity.\nThe action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density over spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nFrom this, we can determine the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$.\n*   The dimension of the four-volume element $d^4x$ is $[d^4x] = (\\text{length})^4 = (\\text{mass})^{-4} = M^{-4}$.\n*   Since the action $S$ is dimensionless, $[S] = M^0$.\n*   Therefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be $[\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$ to cancel the dimension of $d^4x$.\n\nNext, we determine the mass dimensions of the fields from their kinetic terms.\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin, \\psi} = i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$. This term must have a mass dimension of 4.\n    *   The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has a mass dimension of $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   The dimensions must satisfy $[\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = M^4$. Since $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$, we have $2[\\psi] + 1 = 4$.\n    *   Solving for $[\\psi]$, we get $[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$. Consequently, $[\\bar{\\psi}] = M^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin, A} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. This term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n    *   The dimensions must satisfy $[F_{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4$.\n    *   Solving for $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]$, we get $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n\n**2. Calculating the Mass Dimension of $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThis interaction term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = M^4$\n\nLet's write down the dimensions of each part of the term:\n*   $[\\kappa]$ is what we want to find.\n*   $[\\bar{\\psi}] = M^{3/2}$.\n*   The tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$ is constructed from dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is also dimensionless: $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$.\n*   $[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$.\n*   $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n\nNow, we set up the equation for the dimensions of $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$:\n$[\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2} \\cdot M^0 \\cdot M^{3/2} \\cdot M^2 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4$\n\nSolving for $[\\kappa]$:\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**3. Determining Renormalizability**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. The rule of thumb (by power-counting) is as follows:\n*   If the coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the interaction is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If the coupling constant is **dimensionless** (mass dimension 0), the interaction is **renormalizable**.\n*   If the coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory described by this interaction is non-renormalizable. In such theories, higher-order loop calculations generate divergences that require an infinite number of counterterms to be canceled, making the theory lose its predictive power at high energies.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
