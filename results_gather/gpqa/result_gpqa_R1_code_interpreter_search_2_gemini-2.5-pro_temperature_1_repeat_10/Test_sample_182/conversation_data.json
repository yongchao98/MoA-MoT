    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reactant molecule.**\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\nLet's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula and key features.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH), so it is located at position C1 of the ring.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula (CxHyOz) of this reactant.\n*   **Carbons (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):**\n    *   On the ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H₂) -> 7 hydrogens.\n    *   On the functional groups: COOH(H), CHO(H), Vinyl(-CH=CH₂ has 3 H) -> 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 hydrogens.\n    *   Total Hydrogens (H) = 7 + 5 = 12.\n*   **Oxygens (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 oxygen in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   Total Oxygens (O) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs a complete reduction on the molecule:\n*   It reduces carbonyl groups (from aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) completely to methylene (-CH₂-) or methyl (-CH₃) groups.\n*   It reduces alcohol groups (-OH) to alkanes.\n*   It saturates all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds (C≡C), converting them to single bonds (C-C).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure and formula of the product.**\nApplying the effects of the reduction to our reactant:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) at C1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) at C2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **C=C double bond** within the cyclohexene ring (at C3=C4) will be reduced to a **C-C single bond**. The ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at C5 will be reduced to a **C-C single bond**, converting the vinyl group to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the reactant (a C6 ring with C1, C1, and C2 side chains) is preserved. The product will be a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it will be **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\nSince the product is a saturated hydrocarbon containing a single ring (a monocyclic alkane), its general formula is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\nThe number of carbon atoms does not change during the reaction, so n = 10.\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens. (Halogens and oxygens don't directly feature in the common formula).\n\nFor our product with the formula **C₁₀H₂₀**:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n*   N = 0\n\nIHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + (0 / 2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD from the structure of the product (1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane). The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds.\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   Number of pi bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\nTotal IHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nTo confirm the calculation of IHD for the product C₁₀H₂₀, we can use a simple script.\n```python\ndef calculate_ihd(C, H, N=0, X=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for a given molecular formula.\n    C: number of carbon atoms\n    H: number of hydrogen atoms\n    N: number of nitrogen atoms\n    X: number of halogen atoms\n    \"\"\"\n    return C - H / 2 - X / 2 + N / 2 + 1\n\n# Molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\nC = 10\nH = 20\n\nihd = calculate_ihd(C, H)\nprint(f\"The IHD of the product is: {int(ihd)}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nThe IHD of the product is: 1\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product is 1. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one C=C double bond.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: This is the main functional group (-COOH), located at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is attached to C5.\n\nLet's find the molecular formula (CₓHᵧOₙ) by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = 10 carbons.\n*   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   **Hydrogens (H)**:\n    *   H on C1: 1\n    *   H on C2: 1\n    *   H on C3: 1 (part of C=C)\n    *   H on C4: 1 (part of C=C)\n    *   H on C5: 1\n    *   H on C6: 2\n    *   H in -COO**H**: 1\n    *   H in -C**H**O: 1\n    *   H in -CH=C**H₂**: 3\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 1+1+1+1+1+2 + 1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the reaction and determine the product.**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This is a very powerful reducing agent that performs a complete reduction on the molecule.\n*   It reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) to the corresponding alkane groups.\n*   It saturates all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (double and triple bonds).\n\nApplying this to our reactant:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **C=C double bond in the ring** is reduced to a C-C single bond, making the ring a cyclohexane.\n*   The **C=C double bond in the vinyl group** is reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the vinyl group to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton remains the same. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. Based on the reduction, the product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.**\n\nThe product is a saturated cycloalkane. Since no carbons are lost, the product still has 10 carbon atoms. Saturated monocyclic alkanes (cycloalkanes) have the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\nFor our product, n = 10.\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the number of rings plus the number of pi bonds in a molecule.\n\nThe formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C - (H / 2) + 1  (for a molecule containing only C and H)\n\nUsing the product's formula, C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n\nIHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD directly from the structure of the product, **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   Number of pi bonds (C=C or C≡C) = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated)\n*   Total IHD = Number of rings + Number of pi bonds = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the IHD of the product is 1.\n\n```python\n# Python code to verify the IHD calculation for the product C10H20.\ndef calculate_ihd(carbons, hydrogens):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for a hydrocarbon.\"\"\"\n  ihd = carbons - (hydrogens / 2) + 1\n  return int(ihd)\n\n# For the product with molecular formula C10H20\nc = 10\nh = 20\nproduct_ihd = calculate_ihd(c, h)\nprint(product_ihd)\n```\n<execute_output>\n1\n</execute_output>\nThe code confirms that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for a molecule with the formula C₁₀H₂₀ is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>",
