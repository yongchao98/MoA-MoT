    "*   **Analyze the problem:** The question asks which fundamental symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). SMEFT is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators, representing the low-energy effects of some unknown new physics at a higher energy scale, Λ.\n\n*   **Evaluate Lorentz and Poincaré Symmetry (1 and 2):**\n    *   The Standard Model itself is a relativistic quantum field theory, meaning it is invariant under Poincaré transformations. The Poincaré group includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations.\n    *   SMEFT is constructed as a local, effective field theory that is a low-energy limit of a more fundamental theory. A core assumption in its standard construction is that the fundamental laws of physics, and therefore the Lagrangian, are invariant under Poincaré transformations. All operators added in SMEFT are constructed from the SM fields and their derivatives in such a way that they are Lorentz scalars, ensuring the entire Lagrangian remains Lorentz invariant.\n    *   Therefore, both Lorentz symmetry (1) and the full Poincaré symmetry (2) are required by construction in SMEFT.\n\n*   **Evaluate CP Symmetry (3):**\n    *   CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P).\n    *   It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most notably through a complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix governing quark mixing.\n    *   Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it does not need to respect a symmetry that the SM already violates. In fact, many of the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation.\n    *   Therefore, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.\n\n*   **Evaluate CPT Symmetry (4):**\n    *   CPT (Charge-Parity-Time Reversal) symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of nature.\n    *   The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of C, P, and T.\n    *   Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must obey the CPT theorem. All operators in the SMEFT are built to be consistent with these principles. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance, which is a foundational assumption of the theory.\n    *   Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Lorentz symmetry (1) is required.\n    *   Poincaré symmetry (2) is required.\n    *   CP symmetry (3) is **not** required.\n    *   CPT symmetry (4) is required.\n\n*   **Matching with options:**\n    The symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
