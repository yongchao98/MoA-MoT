    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field and the Integral:**\n    The problem defines a vector field `f(r)` that is directed radially and has a magnitude of `1/r^2`. In vector form using spherical coordinates, this is:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇.f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin:\n    `Integral = ∫_V (∇.f) dV`\n\n2.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n    where `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n    *A note on applicability:* The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field to be continuously differentiable throughout the volume. Our field `f(r) = (1/r^2) r_hat` has a singularity at `r=0` (it becomes infinite), which is inside our volume `V`. However, as we will see, we can still use the surface integral part of the theorem to find the correct answer. This method effectively calculates the total \"source\" strength of the divergence at the singularity enclosed within the surface. This is the principle behind Gauss's Law in electromagnetism.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    We need to calculate the flux `∮_S (f . dS)` over the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n    *   **The vector field on the surface `S`:** On this surface, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **The differential surface element `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential area element `dS` is always perpendicular to the surface, pointing radially outward. Its magnitude is `R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`. In vector form:\n        `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`\n    *   **The dot product `f . dS`:** Now, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n        `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] . [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n        Since `r_hat . r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies significantly:\n        `f . dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n4.  **Perform the Integration:**\n    Now we integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's solve the integral in parts:\n    *   First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Next, integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The value of the surface integral is `4π`. By the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the volume integral of the divergence:\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\n    This result is a fundamental concept in vector calculus, often encountered in the context of Gauss's Law for a point charge, where the flux is constant and independent of the radius `R` of the enclosing sphere, as long as the source (the singularity at `r=0`) is inside.\n\n    Therefore, the most appropriate answer is `4π`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 0\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
