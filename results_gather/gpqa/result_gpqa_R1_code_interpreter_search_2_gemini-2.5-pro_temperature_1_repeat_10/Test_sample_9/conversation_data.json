    "*   **Analyze the options:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference point. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This describes a \"Super-Earth\". For planets with the same composition (e.g., the same ratio of iron to silicate rock), the more massive the planet, the stronger its gravitational pull. This increased gravity compresses the material, leading to a higher average density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth's composition will be significantly denser than Earth.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This describes a \"Sub-Earth\". Following the same logic as above, but in reverse, a less massive planet will have weaker gravity. This results in less compression of its material, leading to a lower average density compared to Earth.\n\n*   **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density of (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and compression)\n    *   Density of (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and less compression)\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The planet described in option (c) has the highest mass for a given composition, which leads to the greatest gravitational compression and therefore the highest density among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
