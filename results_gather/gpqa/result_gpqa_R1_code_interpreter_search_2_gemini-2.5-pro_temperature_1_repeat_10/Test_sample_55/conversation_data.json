    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Transition Process\n\nThe problem asks for the decay route from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade process involving an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for spontaneous emission (decay), we must have $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n**For Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Change in l:** The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Change in n:** For decay, we need $n' < 3$. So, $n'$ can be 1 or 2.\n*   **Change in m:** The initial state has $m=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + (0, \\pm 1) = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\nSo, the intermediate state must be of the form $|n', 1, m'\\rangle$ where $n' \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ and $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n**For Transition 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Change in l:** The final state has $l_{final}=0$. The intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (from Transition 1). The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which satisfies the selection rule.\n*   **Change in n:** The final state has $n_{final}=1$. The intermediate state must have $n' > 1$. Combined with the condition from Transition 1 ($n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   **Change in m:** The final state has $m_{final}=0$. From the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, the change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible values of $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Conclusion for the intermediate state:** The intermediate state must be $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, where $m'$ can be -1, 0, or 1. This means there are three possible decay routes:\n*   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific route corresponds to its branching ratio in the overall decay cascade. The probability of a given path is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n**Step 1: Branching ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0, m=0$). There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transition rates to the three degenerate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal.\n\nThis can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate is proportional to $|\\langle n'l'm'|\\mathbf{r}|nlm \\rangle|^2$. For an unpolarized initial state, the rate is independent of $m'$.\n\nSince these three transitions are the only possible E1 decay paths from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state (as it must decay to a p-state, and the only one with $n<3$ is $n=2$), the total probability is divided equally among them.\n\nThe branching ratio for the transition to any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is therefore:\n$B_1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**Step 2: Branching ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\nFrom any of the intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (the 2p states), the only possible E1 decay channel is to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s state). Decay to the $|2,0,0\\rangle$ state is possible but extremely suppressed compared to the decay to the ground state. Therefore, we can assume that any atom in a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with certainty.\n\nThe branching ratio for this second step is:\n$B_2 = 1$\n\n**Total Probability:**\nThe probability for any one of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the branching ratios:\n$P(\\text{route via a specific } m') = B_1 \\times B_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\nWe need to find the option that correctly identifies one of the possible routes and gives the probability as $1/3$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Route and probability are correct)\n\nThus, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
