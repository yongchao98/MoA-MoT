    "Here's a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V = 0). We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Method:** This type of electrostatics problem is best solved using the **Method of Images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conductor with a simple, equivalent \"image charge\" placed inside the conductor. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are the same in both the real system and the image system.\n\n3.  **Define the Image Charge System:**\n    *   For a grounded conducting sphere, the induced charge distribution can be replaced by a single image charge, `q'`.\n    *   The parameters of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `r = R`) is zero.\n    *   The standard results for this configuration are:\n        *   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of a system of charges can be calculated as the work done to bring the charges from an infinite separation to their final positions. A more direct method is to use the formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * Σ(q_i * V_i)`\n    where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n5.  **Apply the Energy Formula to Our System:**\n    *   In the real system, we have the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere `q_induced`. The sphere itself is a single conductor.\n    *   The energy is `U = (1/2) * (q * V_at_q + q_induced * V_sphere)`.\n    *   Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0.\n    *   This simplifies the energy equation to `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`, where `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n6.  **Find the Potential at the location of q:**\n    *   Using the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   So, we need to calculate the potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d` from the center) that is produced by the image charge `q'` (at distance `b` from the center).\n    *   The distance between the point charge `q` and its image `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Potential `V_at_q`:**\n    *   The potential at `d` due to `q'` is `V_at_q = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`, where `k = 1/(4πε₀)`.\n    *   `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V_at_q = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`:**\n    *   Now substitute this potential back into our simplified energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, meaning energy is released as the charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n---\n<<<A>>>"
