    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product for both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group, which is known as a delta-lactone. The structure has a chiral center at carbon 4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\n*   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is the product of Reaction 1.\n*   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is the product of Reaction 2.\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a hydroxy acid. A delta-lactone, being a six-membered ring, is formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's draw its structure:\n\nHOOC-CH₂(¹)-CH₂(²)-CH(Et)(³)-CH₂(⁴)-C(=O)O-iBu(⁵)\n\nThis molecule contains two functional groups that can be reduced:\n*   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH)\n*   An ester group (-CO-O-iBu)\n\nThe molecule also has a chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which is the carbon bearing the ethyl group. This chiral center in the starting material will become the chiral center at C4 in the lactone product.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters and ketones but is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids under standard conditions. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate (COO⁻), which is resistant to reduction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (-CO-O-iBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(LiBH₄)--> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)\n    2.  The resulting 5-hydroxy acid, under acidic workup (H⁺), undergoes intramolecular esterification to form the delta-lactone product.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to track the configuration of the chiral center (C3 in the starting material). To do this, we apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂CO-O-iBu.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂CO-O-iBu (The ester side chain is higher priority than the acid side chain because the isobutyl group's carbon has a higher atomic number than the acid's proton).\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂COOH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n        *   Priority 4: H\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The ester group has been reduced to an alcohol, -CH₂CH₂OH. The groups at C3 are now H, Et, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂CH₂OH.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂COOH (The acid group is higher priority than the alcohol group).\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂CH₂OH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n        *   Priority 4: H\n    *   **Change in Configuration:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material (-CH₂CO-O-iBu) becomes part of the group that is Priority 2 in the intermediate (-CH₂CH₂OH). The group that was Priority 2 (-CH₂COOH) becomes Priority 1. Because the priorities of the top two groups are swapped, the stereochemical designation inverts. An (S) starting material will become an (R) intermediate, and an (R) starting material will become an (S) intermediate.\n    *   **Lactonization:** The cyclization of the hydroxy acid to the lactone does not change the priority order of the groups on the chiral center. Therefore, an (R)-hydroxy acid will form an (R)-lactone.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The overall transformation is (S)-Starting Material → (R)-Lactone. Since the product is (R)-lactone, the starting material **A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is also a selective reducing agent, but it has a strong preference for reducing carboxylic acids over esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group remains unchanged.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu --(BH₃)--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu (isobutyl 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate)\n    2.  The resulting hydroxy ester, under acidic workup (H⁺), undergoes intramolecular transesterification (the -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol) to form the delta-lactone product.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We again track the configuration using CIP rules.\n\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as A.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂CO-O-iBu\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂COOH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n        *   Priority 4: H\n    *   **Intermediate (isobutyl 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate):** The acid group has been reduced to an alcohol, -CH₂CH₂OH. The groups at the chiral center are H, Et, -CH₂CO-O-iBu, and -CH₂CH₂OH.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂CO-O-iBu (The ester group is higher priority than the alcohol group).\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂CH₂OH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl)\n        *   Priority 4: H\n    *   **Change in Configuration:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material (-CH₂CO-O-iBu) remains Priority 1 in the intermediate. The group that was Priority 2 (-CH₂COOH) is transformed into a new group (-CH₂CH₂OH) which becomes the new Priority 2. The priority order of the groups (1 > 2 > 3) does not change. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is retained. An (S) starting material will give an (S) intermediate.\n    *   **Lactonization:** The cyclization of the hydroxy ester to the lactone does not change the priority order. Therefore, an (S)-hydroxy ester will form an (S)-lactone.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The overall transformation is (S)-Starting Material → (S)-Lactone. Since the product is (S)-lactone, the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions, the starting material for both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 must be the same compound: (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n*   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
