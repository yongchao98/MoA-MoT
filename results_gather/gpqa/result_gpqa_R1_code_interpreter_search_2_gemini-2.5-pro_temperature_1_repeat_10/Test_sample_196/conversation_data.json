    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** The broad singlet (bs) far downfield is the signature peak for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield because it is ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield because it is ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):** We need to piece together the structure of the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons means a methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂). Fragment: `CH₃-CH₂-`.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons means a methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a methine group (-CH). Fragment: `CH₃-CH-`.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the first fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the methyl group (3H) and the methine group (1H).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is at a benzylic position (attached to the aromatic ring), which explains its downfield shift. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the adjacent methylene group (2H).\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** We can connect the fragments. The benzylic methine (-CH-) is attached to both a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The structure is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This corresponds to option (C), but this is the reactant, not the product.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Applying the reaction:** The 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced. The carboxylic acid group at position 1 will be converted to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group at position 4 and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions.\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: The -COOH is reduced to -CH₃.\n    *   **Final Product:** The final product is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which is also named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl group (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
