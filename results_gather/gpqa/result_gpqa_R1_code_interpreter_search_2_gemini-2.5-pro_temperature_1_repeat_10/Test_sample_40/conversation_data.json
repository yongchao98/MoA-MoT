    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Lab Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame of the observer.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame, which is at rest with respect to the glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the Glass Frame (S') relative to the Lab Frame (S):** This is given as `v`. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   **Velocity of the Light Beam relative to the Glass Frame (S'):** In any medium with a refractive index `n`, the speed of light is `c/n`. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass (as measured by an observer at rest with the glass) is `u' = 1/n`. This velocity is in the same direction as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of the Light Beam relative to the Lab Frame (S):** This is the quantity we need to find, let's call it `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding two velocities `u'` and `v` that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We have:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived speed `u` is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. Let's check the options:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) 1\n    D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option B.\n\nThis result is a famous experimental confirmation of special relativity, known as the Fizeau experiment on the drag of light in a moving medium.\n\n<<<B>>>"
