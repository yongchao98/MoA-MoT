    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\nb) The total energy ($E$) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1 ($m_1$) = 2m\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1 ($v_1$) = 0.6c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2 ($m_2$) = 3m\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2 ($v_2$) = 0.5c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Plan the Calculation**\n\n**Part A: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\nSince the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we cannot simply subtract the velocities ($v_1 - v_2$). We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula.\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity of object 2 with respect to object 1 ($v_{21}$) is:\n$v_{rel} = v_{21} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   Substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n*   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n*   $v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n*   $v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n*   $v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7}$\n*   $v_{rel} = -\\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nThe question asks for the relative *speed*, which is the magnitude of the velocity.\n*   Speed = $|v_{rel}| = |-\\frac{1}{7}c| = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n*   Now, convert the fraction to a decimal: $\\frac{1}{7} \\approx 0.1428...$\n*   So, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**Part B: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\nThe total energy of a single relativistic object is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma m c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n*   **Step B1: Calculate the energy of astronaut 1 ($E_1$).**\n    *   First, find the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 ($\\gamma_1$):\n        *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Now, calculate $E_1$:\n        *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Step B2: Calculate the energy of astronaut 2 ($E_2$).**\n    *   First, find the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 ($\\gamma_2$):\n        *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3/4}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n    *   Now, calculate $E_2$:\n        *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}}mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3}mc^2$\n\n*   **Step B3: Calculate the total energy ($E_{total}$).**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    *   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nTo compare with the options, let's calculate the numerical value of the coefficient. I will use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part A: Relative Speed\nv1 = 0.6\nv2 = 0.5\nv_rel_fraction = abs((v2 - v1) / (1 - v1 * v2))\nprint(f\"Relative speed: {v_rel_fraction:.3f}c\")\n\n# Part B: Total Energy\n# Lorentz factor for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\n# Energy for astronaut 1 (in units of mc^2)\nE1_coeff = gamma1 * 2\n\n# Lorentz factor for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\n# Energy for astronaut 2 (in units of mc^2)\nE2_coeff = gamma2 * 3\n\n# Total energy coefficient\nE_total_coeff = E1_coeff + E2_coeff\nprint(f\"Total energy: {E_total_coeff:.3f}mc^2\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nRelative speed: 0.143c\nTotal energy: 5.964mc^2\n</execute_output>\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe calculations yield:\n*   Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ 0.14c (rounding 0.143)\n*   Total energy ($E_{total}$) ≈ 5.96mc^2 (rounding 5.964)\n\nThese results match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we must use the relativistic velocity addition (or subtraction) formula, as their speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The formula for the velocity of astronaut 2 relative to astronaut 1 ($v_{21}$) is:\n\n$v_{rel} = v_{21} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -\\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nThe question asks for the relative *speed*, which is the magnitude of the velocity.\n\n$Speed_{rel} = |v_{rel}| = |-\\frac{1}{7}c| = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n*   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}}mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3}mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
