    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon C_n H_m is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n    Setting this equal to 14.28% or 0.1428:\n    `m / (12n + m) ≈ 0.1428`\n    If we use the approximation 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, we get:\n    `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    `7m = 12n + m`\n    `6m = 12n`\n    `m = 2n`\n    So, the general formula for Z is C_n H_{2n}. This formula corresponds to an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the Carbon Skeleton.**\n    *   Mixture X hydrogenates to give only Z.\n    *   Mixture Y hydrogenates to give only Z.\n    This implies that all compounds in both mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Mixture Y is composed of two liquids. One of them is Z. Let's call the other one Y2. So, Y = {Z, Y2}.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components (Z and Y2) are saturated or aromatic. We already know Z is a saturated cycloalkane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. Since Z is already saturated, it does not react. This means that Y2 must hydrogenate to Z.\n    *   For Y2 to be a non-bromine-water-decolorizing liquid that hydrogenates to a cycloalkane Z, Y2 must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of an aromatic ring requires \"severe conditions,\" as mentioned in the problem.\n    *   If Y2 is aromatic, it must be a benzene derivative. The simplest case is that Y2 is benzene (C6H6). The hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   This implies that Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's check the properties of Z = cyclohexane. It is a widely used solvent, and its formula C6H12 fits the C_n H_{2n} pattern. The mass fraction of H in C6H12 is 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This fits perfectly.\n    *   So, we have identified Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Y2 = Benzene (C6H6). Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   X is converted to Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst in a disproportionation reaction. Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, this implies a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry:\n        `X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2`\n        Substituting the components of Y, we get:\n        `X1 + X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides. Both X1 and X2 must have a C6 skeleton because they hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Let their formulas be C6H_a and C6H_b.\n        The hydrogen atom balance gives: `a + b = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n    *   The problem provides more constraints on X1 and X2:\n        *   They decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n        *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   They both must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane, which confirms they have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   Let's find suitable molecules. We need two unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons, one with 'a' hydrogens and one with 'b' hydrogens, such that a+b=18. The molecules must not have conjugated double bonds.\n        *   A candidate is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**. It has one double bond (not conjugated) and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. So, let `a = 10`.\n        *   If `a = 10`, then `b = 18 - 10 = 8`. We need a C6H8 molecule with a cyclohexane skeleton and no conjugated bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is C6H8, but it has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene** is also C6H8. Its two double bonds are separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This is a perfect candidate for the second component.\n\n4.  **Verify the Solution.**\n    *   Let's assume Mixture X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)}.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction (hydrogen transfer) would be:\n        `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\n        In this reaction, cyclohexa-1,4-diene acts as the hydrogen donor (is oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as the hydrogen acceptor (is reduced to cyclohexane). The stoichiometry is 1:1, producing an equimolar mixture Y, as required.\n    *   All conditions given in the problem are satisfied by this set of compounds.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Liquid 1: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
