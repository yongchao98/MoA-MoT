    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Fission Parameters**\n\n*   Initial nucleus at rest:\n    *   Rest-mass energy `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n*   Fission products: Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Mass relationship: \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. The most common interpretation in physics is \"2 times as massive\", which means `m1 = 2 * m2`. If it meant `m1 = m2 + 2*m2 = 3*m2`, the options provided do not lead to a sensible answer. We will proceed with `m1 = 2 * m2`. `m1` is the more massive fragment.\n*   Sum of rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses and Q-value**\n\n*   We have a system of two equations for the masses:\n    1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M` => `3*m2 = 0.99 * M` => `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   Then, `m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`.\n*   Now, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   The Q-value of the reaction is the energy released as kinetic energy. It's the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n    *   `Q = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This Q-value is distributed between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate Kinetic Energy `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy `E` is also `E = T + mc^2` where `T` is the kinetic energy.\n*   From the energy-momentum relation, we can express the momentum as `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`.\n*   Since `p1^2 = p2^2`, we have:\n    *   `E1^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2c^2)^2`\n*   Rearranging gives: `E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1c^2)^2 - (m2c^2)^2`.\n*   Using the difference of squares: `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1c^2 - m2c^2)(m1c^2 + m2c^2)`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial energy is `Mc^2`. The final total energy is `E1 + E2`.\n    *   `E1 + E2 = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Now substitute the known values into the momentum equation:\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * 300 = 99 * 297`\n    *   `E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`.\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n    1.  `E1 + E2 = 300`\n    2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01`\n*   Add the two equations: `2*E1 = 398.01` => `E1 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1c^2`:\n    *   `T1 = E1 - m1c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate Kinetic Energy `T1` using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T_classical = (1/2)mv^2` and momentum is `p_classical = mv`.\n*   We can write `T_classical = p_classical^2 / (2m)`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`. Therefore `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n    *   `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n    *   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   This gives us the ratio of kinetic energies: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`, or `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   The total kinetic energy is still `Q = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) `T1` and the classical `T1_classical`.\n*   Relativistic `T1 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   Classical `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   Difference = `T1 - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The options are in MeV (Mega-electron Volts). We need to convert GeV (Giga-electron Volts) to MeV.\n    *   `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 5 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
