    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A_p)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A_p is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** We need to find T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A_p1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_p2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n\n    The ratio is:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_p1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_p2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It also explicitly states that both planets have the same albedo (A_p1 = A_p2). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [sqrt(1 / a_1)] / [sqrt(1 / a_2)]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    This shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities:** We need to find the ratio a_2 / a_1. The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method: planet masses and the Doppler shifts they induce.\n    The Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (the semi-amplitude, K) by:\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n    K = M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n    where:\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n    Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination `i` is close to 90°. Therefore, we can assume sin(i) ≈ 1 for both planets. The formula simplifies to:\n    K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis `a`:** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\n    a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)]\n\n    The terms G and M_star are the same for both and cancel out:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n8.  **Determine the Ratios of Masses and RV Amplitudes:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:**\n        M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n        M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio:** The amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (since c and λ_0 are constants).\n        K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n        Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n        K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n9.  **Substitute the Ratios and Calculate a_2 / a_1:**\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    To find the decimal value, we perform the division.\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio\nresult = 15 / 28\nprint(result)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.5357. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe result ~0.536 is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
