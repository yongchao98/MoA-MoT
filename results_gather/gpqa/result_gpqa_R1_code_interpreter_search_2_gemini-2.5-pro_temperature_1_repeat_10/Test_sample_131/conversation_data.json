    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Given Information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The mixture contains two compounds, both with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There's a plane of symmetry between C1-C2 and C4-C5, and another between C2-C4 and C5-C1.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   C5 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C4 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show spin-spin splitting. The CH2 group will be a **quartet** (4H), and the CH3 group will be a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   Since the problem states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option A.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Mixture Spectrum Based on Remaining Options**\n\nThe mixture spectrum has **two aromatic singlets** and **three aliphatic singlets**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The mixture has two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since all three tetramethylbenzene isomers each have one aromatic singlet (2H), a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will produce two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio (assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, which is expected). So this information doesn't narrow it down further between options B, C, and D.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** This is the key to solving the problem. The mixture has three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24 protons. An integration ratio of 2:1:1 for 24 protons means the signals correspond to:\n    *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n\nNow let's see which pair of compounds gives this combination of signals (12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Signal sources: (6H, 6H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n    *   This combination gives five potential signals. It doesn't match the required three signals (12H, 6H, 6H) without multiple, unlikely coincidental overlaps.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   Signal sources: (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and (6H, 6H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB.\n    *   Combining these gives exactly three signals with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This is a perfect match with the experimental data without assuming any coincidental overlaps.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Signal sources: (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n    *   This combination gives four potential signals. It would only result in three signals if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB happened to overlap. While possible, Option C provides a more direct and certain explanation.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only one that directly explains the observed spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two 2H singlets (one from each compound) give a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic:** The single 12H peak from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the two 6H peaks from 1,2,3,4-TMB give three signals with a 12:6:6 or 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n<<<C>>>"
