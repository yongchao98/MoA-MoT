    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:**\n    We are given a particle of mass `m` moving in a two-dimensional potential V(r, θ) and we need to find its quantized energy levels (energy spectrum). The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The Schrödinger equation is often easier to solve when the potential is separable. Let's convert the potential from polar coordinates (r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The conversion formulas are:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x)^2\n\n    Now, simplify the expression by combining the terms with x^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 k * x^2 + 3/2 k * x^2) + 1/2 k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 k * x^2) + 1/2 k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n3.  **Recognize the Separable Potential:**\n    The potential V(x, y) is a sum of two independent potentials, one that depends only on x and one that depends only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\n    This means the Hamiltonian of the system is separable, H = H_x + H_y, and the total energy is the sum of the energies from the x and y motions, E = E_x + E_y.\n\n4.  **Identify the Potentials as Simple Harmonic Oscillators (SHOs):**\n    Both V_x(x) and V_y(y) are in the form of a simple harmonic oscillator potential, V(q) = 1/2 mω^2q^2, where ω is the angular frequency.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Frequencies (ω_x and ω_y):**\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        V_x(x) = 2kx^2. Compare this to the standard form V_x(x) = 1/2 mω_x^2x^2.\n        1/2 mω_x^2 = 2k\n        mω_x^2 = 4k\n        ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. Compare this to the standard form V_y(y) = 1/2 mω_y^2y^2.\n        1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k\n        mω_y^2 = k\n        ω_y^2 = k/m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n6.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues for Each SHO:**\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by the formula E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n    *   **Energy for the x-motion (E_{n_x}):**\n        E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x\n        E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    *   **Energy for the y-motion (E_{n_y}):**\n        E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y\n        E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of the energies for the independent x and y motions:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2*sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Now, factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m).\n    This matches option A.\n\n    A) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    B) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
