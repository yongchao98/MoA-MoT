    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the four statements.\n\n**The Impulse Approximation:**\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify a complex many-body problem (an interaction with a nucleus containing A nucleons) into a much simpler two-body problem (an interaction with a single, free nucleon). The name \"impulse\" comes from the idea that the interaction happens so quickly (like a sudden impulse) that the struck nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors, and the binding forces of the nucleus don't have time to act *during* the brief moment of the interaction.\n\nNow let's analyze each assumption in this context:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is a foundational requirement. If the probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino) could interact with multiple nucleons simultaneously (via what are known as meson-exchange currents or two-body currents), the problem could not be reduced to a single-nucleon interaction. The interaction would be inherently a many-body phenomenon. Therefore, to treat the interaction as happening with one nucleon, we must first assume that it *only* interacts with one nucleon. This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. It means that the incoming probe particle travels to the target nucleon without being disturbed by the other nucleons, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) leave the nucleus without any further interactions. These subsequent interactions are called \"final-state interactions\" (FSI). Ignoring them is a major simplification. If the nucleus were not \"transparent,\" the energy and momentum of the outgoing particles would be altered, and the simple picture of a free-nucleon collision would break down. This is a key part of the simplified model, often referred to as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself (a nucleon is made of quarks and gluons). The impulse approximation, however, is about the nucleon's behavior as a single entity *within the nuclear environment*. It contrasts the behavior of a *bound* nucleon with that of a *free* nucleon. The internal physics of the nucleon (whether its constituent quarks are relativistic or not) is a separate issue. In fact, many experiments where the impulse approximation is used involve high momentum transfers, where a relativistic description of the nucleon is necessary, let alone its constituent quarks. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the very essence of the impulse approximation. A \"free\" nucleon is, by definition, one that is not subject to binding forces. This assumption states that during the very short time of the interaction, the potential energy that binds the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus can be ignored compared to the large energy exchanged in the collision. This directly allows us to use the mathematical formalism (the \"matrix element\") for a free nucleon instead of a much more complicated one for a bound nucleon. This assumption is fundamental.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation (in its common, simplified form) are:\n*   The interaction happens on a single nucleon (Assumption 1).\n*   The struck nucleon behaves as if it's free from the nuclear potential during the interaction (Assumption 4).\n*   The rest of the nucleus doesn't interfere with the incoming or outgoing particles (Assumption 2).\n\nTherefore, assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are the correct combination.\n\n<<<C>>>"
