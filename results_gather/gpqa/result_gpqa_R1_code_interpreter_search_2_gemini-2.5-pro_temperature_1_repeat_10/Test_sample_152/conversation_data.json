    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants**:\n    *   **Michael Donor**: Dimethyl malonate (`CH2(COOCH3)2`). In the presence of a base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `[-]CH(COOCH3)2`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-CH3C6H4-CH=CH-COOCH3`). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The electrophilic site for Michael addition is the β-carbon (the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group).\n    *   **Reagents**: Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) as the base and ethanol (EtOH) as the solvent.\n\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  The malonate enolate `[-]CH(COOCH3)2` acts as a nucleophile.\n    2.  It attacks the β-carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n    3.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    4.  This generates an intermediate enolate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon.\n\n*   **Product Structure (A)**:\n    The resulting structure is `(CH3OOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n\n*   **Naming Product A**:\n    To name this molecule, we can identify the longest carbon chain that contains the maximum number of principal functional groups (the esters). We can name it as a substituted propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n    *   The main propane chain is `C1-C2-C3`.\n    *   Let C1 be the carbon from the malonate, which has two methyl carboxylate groups: `(CH3OOC)2CH-`.\n    *   Let C2 be the β-carbon from the acrylate, which is bonded to the p-tolyl group: `-CH(p-tolyl)-`.\n    *   Let C3 be the α-carbon from the acrylate, which becomes a `-CH2-` group, attached to the third methyl carboxylate group.\n    *   Combining these gives the structure: `(CH3OOC)2-C1H - C2H(p-tolyl) - C3H2-COOCH3`.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants**:\n    *   **Michael Donor**: `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine`. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent nucleophiles for Michael additions (this specific type is called the Stork enamine alkylation). The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: `(E)-but-2-enenitrile` (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The electrophilic β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   **Reagents**: Methanol (MeOH) as the solvent, followed by an acidic workup (`H3O+`).\n\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an intermediate iminium ion (from the enamine part) and a carbanion (from the nitrile part).\n    3.  The carbanion is protonated.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H3O+`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n*   **Product Structure (B)**:\n    The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the α-position (C2). The substituent is the butanenitrile group, attached at its C3 position. The structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN` group at the C2 position.\n\n*   **Naming Product B**:\n    We can name this molecule in two ways:\n    1.  As a substituted cyclohexanone: `2-(butanenitril-3-yl)cyclohexanone`.\n    2.  As a substituted butanenitrile: `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n    The keto form (`-one`) is generally more stable than the enol form (`-ol`), so the major product will be the ketone. The name provided in the correct option is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants**:\n    *   **Michael Donor**: Reactant C (unknown).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: `but-3-en-2-one` (`CH2=CH-CO-CH3`), also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n    *   **Reagents**: Potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the base and water (H2O) as the solvent.\n\n*   **Product**: `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\n*   **Retrosynthesis (working backward from the product)**:\n    1.  The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton and a `(3-oxobutyl)` side chain (`-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3`).\n    2.  The side chain, `(3-oxobutyl)`, corresponds to the Michael acceptor, `but-3-en-2-one`, after it has accepted a nucleophile and been protonated.\n    3.  The Michael addition reaction forms a new C-C bond between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. In this case, the bond is between C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the terminal `CH2` group of MVK.\n    4.  This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`, formed by deprotonating the highly acidic C2 proton (located between the two carbonyl groups) with KOH.\n    5.  Therefore, the starting material, reactant C, must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A**: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B**: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C**: cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that they match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
