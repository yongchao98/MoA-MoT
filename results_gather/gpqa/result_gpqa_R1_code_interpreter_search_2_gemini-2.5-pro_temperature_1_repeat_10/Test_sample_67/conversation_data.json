    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n*   Initially, a magnetic field `B` is applied in the `+Z` direction. The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is \"aligned\" with this field.\n*   The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -μ_z * B = -γ * S_z * B`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S_z` is the spin operator for the z-direction.\n*   \"Aligned\" with the field means the particle is in its lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up, `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down, `|-z>`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γ * B * (ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γ * B * (ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`. In the standard `S_z` basis, this can be represented as the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian for t > 0\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -μ_y * B = -γ * B * S_y`.\n*   The spin operator `S_y` in the `S_z` basis is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time Evolution of the State\n\n*   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting the new Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i * (-γBS_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ)`\n*   This operator represents a rotation of the spin state around the Y-axis. Let's calculate its matrix form. Let `ω = γB`. The operator is `exp(i * ω * t * S_y / ħ)`.\n    `exp(i * (ωt/ħ) * (ħ/2) * σ_y) = exp(i * (ωt/2) * σ_y)`\n*   Using the identity `exp(iθ * σ_k) = cos(θ) * I + i * sin(θ) * σ_k` where `I` is the identity matrix and `σ_k` is a Pauli matrix:\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * I + i * sin(ωt/2) * σ_y`\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i * sin(ωt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[sin(ωt/2), 0], [0, -sin(ωt/2)]] * i * [[0,-i],[i,0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n*   Now, apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n*   In Dirac notation, this is: `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2) |+z> - sin(ωt/2) |-z>`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Moment\n\n*   We want to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ * <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n*   First, let's calculate the action of `S_z` on `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `S_z |ψ(t)> = S_z * (cos(ωt/2) |+z> - sin(ωt/2) |-z>)`\n    Since `S_z|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`, we have:\n    `S_z |ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2) * (ħ/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)|-z>`\n    `S_z |ψ(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2) |+z> + sin(ωt/2) |-z>]`\n*   Now, we take the inner product with `<ψ(t)| = cos(ωt/2) <+z| - sin(ωt/2) <-z|`:\n    `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|) * (cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n*   Using the orthogonality of the basis states (`<+z|+z> = 1`, `<-z|-z> = 1`, `<+z|-z> = 0`), the cross-terms vanish:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n*   Using the double-angle trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   Now we can find the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n*   Substitute back `ω = γB`:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n*   This equation describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `A*cos(Ωt + φ)`, where `Ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing our result `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can identify the angular oscillation frequency as:\n    `Ω = γB`\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and the frequency `Ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
