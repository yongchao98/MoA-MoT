    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves the population of atomic energy levels in stars, and it states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This means the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels, an upper level 'j' and a lower level 'i':\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k_B * T)]\n    where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `E_j - E_i = ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to the two stars:** The problem compares the \"excitation\" in a specific energy level for two stars. \"Excitation\" is typically interpreted as the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to the number in the ground state. Let's denote this ratio by `R`.\n\n    For star_1 with temperature T_1:\n    R_1 = (N_excited / N_ground)_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)]\n    (where C is the ratio of statistical weights, g_excited / g_ground, which is constant for a given transition).\n\n    For star_2 with temperature T_2:\n    R_2 = (N_excited / N_ground)_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Use the condition given in the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition:**\n    C * exp[-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)] = 2 * (C * exp[-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)])\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The constant C cancels out from both sides.\n    exp[-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)])\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x:\n    -ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):**\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k_B * T_2) - ΔE / (k_B * T_1)\n\n9.  **Factor out the common term (ΔE / k_B) and combine the fractions:**\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k_B) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k_B) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n10. **Incorporate the given numerical value:** The problem states that the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k_B, is 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. This specific choice of value for ΔE is a strong hint that you should evaluate the constant factor `ΔE / k_B`.\n    ΔE / k_B ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K.\n\n11. **Substitute this value back into the equation:**\n    ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n12. **Compare with the given options:** The options are written without any physical constants. This is a common convention in physics problems where quantities are treated as dimensionless by normalizing them with respect to some characteristic value. In this case, the characteristic temperature is `T_char = ΔE / k_B = 1 K`. If we consider T_1 and T_2 to be dimensionless values (i.e., `T_1_physical / (1 K)`), the constant `(1 K)` drops out of the equation.\n    The resulting algebraic form is:\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n    This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
