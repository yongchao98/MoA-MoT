    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO) using 1H-NMR Data**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5`. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (like C=C or C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Signal Interpretation:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two neighboring protons (n+1 rule, n=2), suggesting a -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group. Its doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment (an acetaldehyde group).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm), each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The chemical shifts being relatively upfield (below 7 ppm) indicates the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is typical for an amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to exchange with the solvent and quadrupolar effects of the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a `-CH2-CHO` group.\n    *   We have a `-NH2` group.\n    *   We have a `C6H4` (para-phenylene) group.\n    *   Assembling these fragments gives `H2N-C6H4-CH2-CHO`. The total formula is `C8H9NO`, which matches the given molecular formula.\n    *   The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    *   This is the standard reagent for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   Product: `[p-Cl- +N2-C6H4-CH2-CHO]` (4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride).\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    *   Adding water (often with gentle warming) to an aqueous solution of an aromatic diazonium salt results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Product: `p-HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO` (**4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**).\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde functional group and acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule.\n        ```\n        Molecule 1 (enolate) + Molecule 2 (aldehyde) -> Aldol Adduct\n        (HO-Ph-CH(-)-CHO) + (HO-Ph-CH2-CHO) -> HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO\n        ```\n        The initial addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which is option A).\n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions indicates that the reaction will not stop at the aldol adduct. The adduct will undergo dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) is removed, and the -OH group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated, forming an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        ```\n        HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO --(Heat, -H2O)--> HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO\n        ```\n    *   **Final Product Identification:** The structure `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO` needs to be named according to IUPAC rules.\n        *   The main chain is a `butenal` (4 carbons with a C=C and a CHO).\n        *   The aldehyde is C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3, so it is a `but-2-enal`.\n        *   There is a `4-hydroxyphenyl` group on C2.\n        *   There is a `4-hydroxyphenyl` group on C4 (attached via the CH2).\n        *   The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option D.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration) to yield 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal as the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
