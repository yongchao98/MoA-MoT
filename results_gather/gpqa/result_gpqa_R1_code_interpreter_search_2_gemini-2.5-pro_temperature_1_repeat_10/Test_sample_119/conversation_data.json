    "Here's the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Assumptions and Definitions:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution of stars:** This means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant. Let's call this constant density `ρ`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is `d = 1/plx`. For simplicity, we can ignore the specific units (parsecs and arcseconds) as we are interested in the proportionality.\n    *   **Goal:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit parallax range, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, depends on `plx`.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`):\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Express everything in terms of parallax (plx):**\n    *   We need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`, we differentiate the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars in a parallax interval, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases). We can write the relationship between the small increments as:\n        `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Substitute into the expression for dN:**\n    *   Start with the equation for the number of stars in the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` into the equation:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve for dN/d(plx):**\n    *   Combine the terms with `plx`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴)`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, the relationship is:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n    *   This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1/plx³\nB) ~ 1/plx⁴\nC) ~ 1/plx¹\nD) ~ 1/plx²\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
