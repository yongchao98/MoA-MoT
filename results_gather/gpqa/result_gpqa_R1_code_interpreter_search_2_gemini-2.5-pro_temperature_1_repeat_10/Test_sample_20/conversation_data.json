    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers that are readily interconvertible. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it generally needs an alpha-hydrogen atom—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom that is adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzoquinone has a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl carbons (alpha-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring.\n    *   **Hybridization:** All carbon atoms in the benzoquinone ring are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since there are no sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons with alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo the typical keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound has a six-membered cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to the carbonyls at C1 and C3.\n    *   **Hybridization:** These alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) are sp³ hybridized and each carries two hydrogen atoms (alpha-hydrogens).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because it possesses acidic alpha-hydrogens on sp³ hybridized carbons, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Result for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The four groups attached to C2 are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups are different, C2 is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl Fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:**\n        *   There are no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n        *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point at the center of the C=C bond). A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it cannot have enantiomers and is not optically active. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Result for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Combination**\n\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
