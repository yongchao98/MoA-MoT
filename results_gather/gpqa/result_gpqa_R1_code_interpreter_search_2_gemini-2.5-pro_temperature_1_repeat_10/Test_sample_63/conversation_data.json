    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data to identify the products and their quantities.**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H2O) produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H2O = 1.008 * 2 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** The mass of this tube did not change. Calcium hydroxide solution (limewater) reacts with acidic gases like CO2 or SO2 to form a precipitate. Since there was no mass change, no such acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas reacted with the copper. The mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO\n    *   The mass increase is the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since the gas is O2, the moles of O2 gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O2 = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Gas C passed through a drying agent, limewater, and hot copper without reacting. This indicates it is a non-acidic, non-oxidizing, and relatively inert gas. The most common such gas resulting from the decomposition of salts is nitrogen (N2).\n\n**Summary of Decomposition Products:**\n*   0.2 mol of H2O\n*   0.025 mol of O2\n*   0.1 mol of N2\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nLet's find the total mass of the elements (N, H, O) in the gaseous products. This must equal the mass of the initial salt mixture.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** from 0.2 mol H2O → 2 * 0.2 = 0.4 mol H atoms.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol * 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.4 g.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** from 0.1 mol N2 → 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 mol N atoms.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.2 mol * 14.007 g/mol ≈ 2.8 g.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** from 0.2 mol H2O and 0.025 mol O2 → (1 * 0.2) + (2 * 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O atoms.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol * 16.00 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n\nTotal mass of elements = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.2 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that salts A and B are composed only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O. They are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. The most common ones are ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). The problem states that the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume the mixture contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite:** NH4NO2(s) → N2(g) + 2H2O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate:** The decomposition of NH4NO3 can vary with temperature. At ~200°C, it typically produces N2O and H2O. However, this does not fit our products (N2 and O2). At higher temperatures (>250°C), the reaction is: 2NH4NO3(s) → 2N2(g) + O2(g) + 4H2O(g). Let's assume this reaction pathway occurs under the given conditions, as it produces the observed gases.\n\nLet A = NH4NO2 and B = NH4NO3. For an equimolar mixture of `n` moles each:\n*   `n` NH4NO2 → `n` N2 + `2n` H2O\n*   `n` NH4NO3 → `n` N2 + `0.5n` O2 + `2n` H2O  (by taking the second reaction per mole)\n\n**Total products from the mixture:**\n*   Total N2 = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O2 = `0.5n`\n*   Total H2O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nThe molar ratio of the products is N2 : O2 : H2O = 2n : 0.5n : 4n, which simplifies to **4 : 1 : 8**.\n\nLet's check the molar ratio from our experimental results:\n*   N2 : O2 : H2O = 0.1 mol : 0.025 mol : 0.2 mol\n*   Dividing by the smallest value (0.025): (0.1/0.025) : (0.025/0.025) : (0.2/0.025) = **4 : 1 : 8**.\n\nThe ratios match perfectly. Our hypothesis that the salts are NH4NO2 and NH4NO3 is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the moles of each salt and verify the mass.**\n\nWe can find the value of `n` from the amount of any product. Using O2:\n*   Total O2 = `0.5n` = 0.025 mol\n*   `n` = 0.025 / 0.5 = 0.05 mol\n\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH4NO2 and 0.05 mol of NH4NO3. Let's verify the total mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH4NO2 = 64.04 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH4NO3 = 80.04 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g.\n*   Total mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given mass of 7.20 g.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n*   **Salt A (NH4NO2):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH4NO3):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
