    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state:** The system consists of two electrons, and its state is described by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement:** A measurement of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed. This corresponds to projecting the initial state onto the basis of uncoupled states, which are simultaneous eigenstates of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. These uncoupled states are denoted as $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$.\n\n3.  **Identify the target final state:** The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   For $L_{1z}$ to have an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$, we must have $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For $L_{2z}$ to have an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$, we must have $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the target final state is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n4.  **Connect the initial and final states:** The probability of finding the system in the target state after the measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state.\n    *   Probability $P = |< \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} >|^2$\n    *   $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n    *   The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n5.  **Apply the conservation of angular momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component angular momentum operator is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   When $L_z$ acts on the initial (coupled) state $|l, m>$, the eigenvalue is $m\\hbar$.\n        $L_z |l, m> = m\\hbar |l, m>$.\n        For our initial state, $L_z |2, -1> = -1\\hbar |2, -1>$.\n    *   When $L_z$ acts on the final (uncoupled) state $|m_1, m_2>$, the eigenvalue is $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar$.\n        $L_z |m_1, m_2> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z})|m_1, m_2> = (m_1\\hbar + m_2\\hbar)|m_1, m_2> = (m_1+m_2)\\hbar |m_1, m_2>$.\n        For our target final state, $L_z |-1, -1> = (-1 + (-1))\\hbar |-1, -1> = -2\\hbar |-1, -1>$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the probability:** The initial state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$.\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m> |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$\n    A crucial selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ to be non-zero is that the z-components must add up: $m = m_1 + m_2$. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n7.  **Check the condition for the given problem:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we need $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We check if the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied: $-1 \\neq -2$.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial state and the target final state must be zero.\n    *   $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n    *   The probability is the square of this coefficient: $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n    *   This means it is impossible to measure $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ simultaneously when the system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1>$. The measurement outcome is forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics.\n\n<<<D>>>"
