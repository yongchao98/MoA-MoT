    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the surface defined by the given metric.\nThe metric is:\n$$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$$\n\nIn differential geometry, the area $A$ of a 2-dimensional surface is calculated by integrating the area element $dA$ over the entire surface. The area element is given by $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$, where $g$ is the metric tensor.\n\n1.  **Determine the metric tensor and its determinant.**\n    The given metric is in the form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + g_{yy}dy^2$, where the components of the metric tensor are:\n    $$g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$$\n    $$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$$\n    The metric tensor $g$ can be written as a matrix:\n    $$g = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The determinant of the metric tensor is:\n    $$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2$$\n\n2.  **Find the area element.**\n    The area element $dA$ is the square root of the determinant:\n    $$dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2} \\, dx \\, dy = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$$\n\n3.  **Define the domain of integration.**\n    The metric is physically meaningful only when the terms are real. The denominator $4-x^2-y^2$ must be positive, which means $x^2+y^2 < 4$. This inequality defines an open disk $D$ centered at the origin with a radius of 2. The question refers to this as the \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\", where $r=2$ is the boundary of the coordinate domain. We need to calculate the area of this entire disk.\n\n4.  **Set up the area integral.**\n    The total area $A$ is the integral of the area element $dA$ over the disk $D$:\n    $$A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the integral.**\n    To evaluate this integral, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates. Let $x = r\\cos\\theta$ and $y = r\\sin\\theta$. Then $x^2+y^2=r^2$ and the area element in the coordinates becomes $dx\\,dy = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$. The domain of integration in polar coordinates is $0 \\le r < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$.\n\n    The integral becomes:\n    $$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-r^2} \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$$\n    First, we integrate with respect to $\\theta$:\n    $$A = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr$$\n    This is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32r}{4-r^2}$ is undefined at $r=2$. We evaluate it using a limit:\n    $$A = 2\\pi \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr$$\n    Let's use the substitution $u = 4-r^2$. Then $du = -2r\\,dr$, which means $r\\,dr = -\\frac{1}{2}du$.\n    The limits of integration for $u$ are:\n    When $r=0$, $u = 4-0^2 = 4$.\n    When $r=a$, $u = 4-a^2$.\n\n    Substituting these into the integral:\n    $$\\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr = \\int_{4}^{4-a^2} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}du\\right) = -16 \\int_{4}^{4-a^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du$$\n    $$= -16 \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{4}^{4-a^2} = -16 \\left( \\ln|4-a^2| - \\ln|4| \\right)$$\n    Now we take the limit as $a \\to 2^-$:\n    $$\\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left[-16 \\left( \\ln(4-a^2) - \\ln(4) \\right)\\right]$$\n    As $a \\to 2^-$, the term $4-a^2 \\to 0^+$, and $\\ln(4-a^2) \\to -\\infty$.\n    So, the value of the integral is:\n    $$-16(-\\infty - \\ln(4)) = +\\infty$$\n    Therefore, the total area is:\n    $$A = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$$\n\nThe area of the given surface is infinite.\n\n<<<B>>>"
