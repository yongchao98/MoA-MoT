    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which of them are chiral and are not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers), but the ultimate test is the absence of any improper axis of rotation (S_n), which includes planes of symmetry (S_1) and centers of inversion (S_2). The question specifies particular stereoisomers for most compounds, so we evaluate the chirality of that specific structure.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `ClCH=C(CH₃)CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   This is an alkene. The atoms connected to the double bond (C1, C2, Cl, H, C from methyl, C from ethyl) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex, bridged bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the stereochemical configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of an exocyclic double bond (E).\n    *   The designation of a specific configuration (like R or S) implies that these centers are chiral. The molecule is specified as a single, distinct stereoisomer.\n    *   A complex molecule with multiple specified stereocenters like this one is extremely unlikely to possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that would render it achiral (meso). The specific `(R,S)` combination here does not lead to such symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is a chiral molecule presented as a single enantiomer and is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The specified isomer is (2R, 3S). Let's examine its structure. In a Fischer projection with the COOH groups at the top and bottom, the H and CH₃ groups on C2 and C3 are on opposite sides. This configuration results in a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The specified isomer is (2R, 3R). Both stereocenters have the same configuration. This molecule does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since a specific enantiomer is given, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (i) -H, (ii) -OH, (iii) the `-CH₂-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and (iv) the `-CH₂-CH₂-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis isomer).\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry. In its most stable chair conformation, all three large OH groups will occupy equatorial positions. This conformation possesses a C₃ axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the CH₂ group on the opposite side of the ring (e.g., the plane containing C1 and C4).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH₃)₂CHCH₂CH₂C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters. A carbon atom is a stereocenter if it is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   In the `(CH₃)₂CH-` group, the carbon is bonded to H, two identical methyl groups, and a `CH₂` group. It is not a stereocenter.\n    *   There are no other atoms bonded to four different groups in the chain or in the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and lacks any other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It is an achiral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Optically Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   Optically Inactive: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (meso)\n*   **Optically Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Optically Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically Inactive: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   Optically Inactive: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
