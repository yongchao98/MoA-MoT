    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It has a C2 axis of symmetry and is achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2      H\n                   \\    /\n                    C==C\n                   /    \\\n                  H      CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. The stereochemical rule is: **trans-alkene + syn-addition → racemic mixture of enantiomers**.\n        *   The product is a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are enantiomers.\n\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This is an *anti*-addition process (the two -OH groups in the final diol are added to opposite faces of the original double bond).\n        *   Let's consider the opening of each enantiomer from the epoxide mixture:\n            *   For (4R,5R)-epoxide, attack by water at C4 (inversion of stereocenter) yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are two names for the same **meso** compound. A meso compound is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n            *   For (4S,5S)-epoxide, attack by water at C4 or C5 also yields the same **meso** compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Reaction 1:** The net reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene. The stereochemical rule is: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, the meso isomer (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It has a plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2      CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\    /\n                    C==C\n                   /    \\\n                  H      H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used as in Reaction 1.\n    1.  **mCPBA (syn-addition):** The stereochemical rule is: **cis-alkene + syn-addition → meso compound**.\n        *   The product is the meso-epoxide: cis-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+, anti-addition):** The meso-epoxide undergoes ring-opening.\n        *   Attack at the two equivalent carbons of the meso-epoxide leads to inversion of stereochemistry at the point of attack.\n        *   Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) will produce one enantiomer of the diol, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) will produce the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers is formed. This is a racemic mixture.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Reaction 2:** The net reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene. The stereochemical rule is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a meso compound, from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (a chiral compound, from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the enantiomer of the above, from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is important:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso (4R,5S)-diol is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral chromatography separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated, eluting at different times.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will *not* be separated. They co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The unresolved racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Total observed peaks = 2.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral chromatography uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers.\n    *   It can separate **diastereomers** *and* **enantiomers**.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks (assuming perfect resolution).\n    *   The chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** One enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   **Peak 3:** The other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Total observed peaks = 3.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
