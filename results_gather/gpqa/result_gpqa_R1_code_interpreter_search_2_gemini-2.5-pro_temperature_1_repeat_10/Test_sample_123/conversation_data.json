    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation from special relativity and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n1.  **Radioactive Decay Law:** The number of particles N that have not decayed after a time t is given by the formula:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)\n    where N₀ is the initial number of particles and T is the mean lifetime of the particles.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** For particles moving at a relativistic speed, their internal clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab frame). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame (T_lab) is related to its proper mean lifetime (τ, the lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor (γ):\n    T_lab = γ * τ\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius R = 30 m. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, meaning their speed v is very close to the speed of light, c. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n    t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n4.  **Combining the Concepts:** We can substitute the time-dilated lifetime (T_lab) and the time of flight (t_lab) into the decay equation. The fraction of particles that reach the detector wall is N/N₀:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / T_lab)\n    N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))\n    N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))\n\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for a given particle type and detector setup. Let's call this constant K.\n    K = R / (c * τ)\n    So the equation simplifies to:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)\n\n5.  **Using the Initial Condition:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor γ₁ = 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n    1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n    To solve for K, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor:** We want to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) for which two-thirds (2/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n    2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n    -ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂\n    ln(3/2) = K / γ₂\n    γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the value of K we found in step 5 into the equation for γ₂.\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\nTo get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a short script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the numerator and denominator\nnumerator = 20 * math.log(3)\ndenominator = math.log(3/2)\n\n# Calculate gamma_2\ngamma_2 = numerator / denominator\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 54.18. This value is very close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
