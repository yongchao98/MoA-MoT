    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Product 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane is a rigid, symmetric C₁₀H₁₆ alkane.\n2.  **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions. A simple substitution or elimination is unlikely. Bridgehead elimination is forbidden by Bredt's rule under normal conditions, and bridgehead substitution is slow. The harsh conditions suggest a skeletal rearrangement is likely.\n3.  **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   The total number of protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. This matches the number of protons in the starting material, so the molecular formula of Product 1 must be C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows three signals with integrations 2H, 10H, and 2H. This implies a high degree of symmetry, likely a C₂ axis, which makes protons appear in pairs.\n4.  **Structure Determination:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under strong basic conditions is known to cause complex rearrangements. A known product from a related rearrangement starting from the adamantane skeleton is **tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]decan-4-one**, also known as **isotwistan-4-one**.\n    *   This structure has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   It possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry, which is consistent with the simplified NMR spectrum showing protons in pairs.\n    *   The strained cage structure and the proximity of the carbonyl group can lead to unusual chemical shifts, including highly deshielded protons like the signal at 4.79 ppm, which corresponds to the two bridgehead protons alpha to the carbonyl group.\n\nTherefore, **Product 1 is isotwistan-4-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Product 2\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (isotwistan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃) to form Product 2.\n2.  **Inference from the next step:** Product 2 is subsequently treated with ozone (O₃), which is a reaction specific to alkenes (C=C double bonds). Therefore, **Product 2 must be an alkene**.\n3.  **Reaction Pathway:** The transformation of a ketone (Product 1) into an alkene (Product 2) using Al(O-iPr)₃/heat is not a standard textbook reaction. However, a plausible sequence is:\n    a.  Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of the ketone to the corresponding alcohol, isotwistan-4-ol.\n    b.  Lewis acid (Al(O-iPr)₃) catalyzed dehydration of the alcohol at high temperature to form an alkene.\n    This sequence would convert C₁₀H₁₄O (ketone) to C₁₀H₁₄ (alkene).\n4.  **Structure Determination:** The dehydration of isotwistan-4-ol, likely proceeding through a carbocation, can involve further rearrangement. A plausible alkene product that maintains the C₁₀H₁₄ formula and the isotwistane skeleton is **tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]dec-1-ene**, also known as **isotwistene**. This alkene is a known compound and is a logical precursor for the next step.\n\nTherefore, **Product 2 is isotwistene**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Product 3\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (isotwistene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction.\n2.  **Reaction Outcome:** Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. Since the double bond in isotwistene is tetrasubstituted (part of the ring structure), the product will be a diketone.\n3.  **Structure Determination:** Cleaving the C1=C2 double bond of the tricyclic isotwistene opens one of the rings. The resulting product is a bicyclic diketone. The established product from the ozonolysis of isotwistene is **cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane-2,7-dione**.\n    *   The starting alkene, isotwistene, has the formula C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   The ozonolysis product, cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane-2,7-dione, has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O₂. This is consistent.\n\nTherefore, **Product 3 is cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane-2,7-dione**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n1.  **Target Molecule:** We need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane-2,7-dione.\n2.  **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:**\n    *   The structure has a C₂ axis of symmetry.\n    *   Protons alpha to a carbonyl group are deshielded. In this molecule, the alpha protons are the bridgehead protons (at C1 and C6) and the methylene protons at C3 and C8.\n    *   The bridgehead protons (H1 and H6) are tertiary and alpha to one of the carbonyl groups (H1 is alpha to C2=O, H6 is alpha to C7=O). These are generally the most deshielded protons in such systems.\n3.  **Determining the Coupling Pattern:** Let's analyze the coupling for the proton at C1 (H1).\n    *   H1 is coupled to the protons on adjacent carbons. The adjacent carbons are C6, C10, and C2.\n    *   There is no proton on C2 (it's a C=O).\n    *   H1 is coupled to the single proton on C6 (H6). This splitting will produce a **doublet**.\n    *   H1 is coupled to the two protons on C10 (H10). These two protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent). They would normally split H1 into a doublet of doublets.\n    *   Therefore, the full theoretical pattern for H1 would be a doublet (from H6) of doublets (from H10a) of doublets (from H10b), i.e., a **ddd**.\n4.  **Simplifying the Pattern:** A \"ddd\" is not among the options. In flexible ring systems, it's common for complex multiplets to be simplified due to conformational averaging or accidental equivalence of coupling constants. A common simplification is that the two diastereotopic protons of an adjacent CH₂ group behave as if they are equivalent.\n    *   If we approximate the two H10 protons as being equivalent, they will split H1 into a **triplet** (according to the n+1 rule, where n=2).\n    *   This triplet is then further split by the single H6 proton into a doublet.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. (The appearance could also be a triplet of doublets, depending on the relative J values, but \"doublet of triplets\" is an option).\n5.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   A) triplet: Incorrect. Requires 2 equivalent neighbors. H1 has 3.\n    *   B) pentet: Incorrect. Requires 4 equivalent neighbors. H1 has 3.\n    *   C) triplet of triplets: Incorrect. Requires coupling to two different sets of two equivalent neighbors. H1 couples to one proton (H6) and a set of two protons (on C10).\n    *   D) doublet of triplets: Correct. This pattern arises from coupling to one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of two approximately equivalent protons (giving the triplet). This matches our analysis for the most deshielded proton, H1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
