    "This problem involves the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton, which is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis:**\n*   The process is $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$.\n*   The antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is described as \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume it's effectively at rest.\n*   Typically in such problems, the proton ($p$) is also assumed to be at rest in the lab frame unless stated otherwise.\n*   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is approximately zero.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The antiproton has the same mass as the proton.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n*   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27\\,\\text{MeV} = 1876.54\\,\\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Final State Analysis:**\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All these particles have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   We are given the rest mass energy of particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300\\,\\text{MeV}$.\n*   From the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must be zero (since the initial momentum was zero).\n*   For the total momentum to be zero, the four resulting particles must fly off in a symmetric configuration. Due to this symmetry and the fact they all have the same mass, they must all have the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same total energy, $E_A$.\n*   The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n*   According to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**4. Calculation:**\n*   We can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n*   Plugging in the known values:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27\\,\\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300\\,\\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Now, we solve for the velocity, $v$, using the definition of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
