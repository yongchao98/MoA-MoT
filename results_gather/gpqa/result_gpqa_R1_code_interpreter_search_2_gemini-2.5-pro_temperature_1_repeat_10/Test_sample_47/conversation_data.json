    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis is the α-bromination of a ketone. The reaction takes place at the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so the two α-positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent. The reaction yields 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis step involves an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH). Crucially, the ketone has protons on the other α-carbon (the α'-position, C6). These conditions are classic for the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an α'-proton from C6, forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The three-membered ring opens to relieve strain, resulting in the formation of a carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation of the carbanion (during workup, which is implied) gives the final product.\n\nThe result of this rearrangement is a ring contraction from a six-membered ring to a five-membered ring. The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**\n\n*(Note: While an elimination reaction to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is also possible, the Favorskii rearrangement is a very common and expected pathway under these conditions. Following the elimination path leads to a final product with a number of distinct hydrogens not listed in the options, which strongly suggests the Favorskii path is the intended one.)*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard reaction to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n\n*   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n2.  **Total Hydrogens:** There is 1 aldehydic proton, 1 proton on the carbon where the aldehyde is attached (C1), and 2 protons on each of the other four carbons of the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5). Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 hydrogens.\n3.  **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon, its attached hydrogen, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n4.  **Chemical Equivalence:** Hydrogens that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n\nLet's count the sets of distinct hydrogens:\n\n*   **Set 1:** The **aldehydic proton** (-CHO). It is in a unique chemical environment. (1 proton)\n*   **Set 2:** The **methine proton** on C1 (the carbon attached to the aldehyde group). This proton is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 proton)\n*   **Set 3 & 4:** The protons on C2 and C5. Because of the symmetry plane, the set of protons on C2 is equivalent to the set on C5. However, within the CH₂ group at C2, the two protons are **diastereotopic**. This is because replacing one versus the other would create a diastereomer (the molecule has a prochiral center at C1). Therefore, these two protons are chemically distinct from each other. The symmetry plane makes one proton on C2 equivalent to one on C5, and the other proton on C2 equivalent to the other on C5. This gives two distinct sets of hydrogens from these positions. (2 protons in each set)\n*   **Set 5 & 6:** The protons on C3 and C4. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C4 due to symmetry. The two protons on the C3 methylene group are also **diastereotopic** and thus chemically distinct. This gives another two distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 protons in each set)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCounting the distinct sets, we have:\n1.  Aldehydic H\n2.  C1-H\n3.  C2/C5-H (one type)\n4.  C2/C5-H (another type)\n5.  C3/C4-H (one type)\n6.  C3/C4-H (another type)\n\nIn total, there are **6** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
