    "Here is the thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   Initial solution: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Dilution: Add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   Titrant: 0.1 M NaOH (a strong base).\n    *   Analyte: The diluted acetic acid (a weak acid).\n    *   Ka for acetic acid = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵.\n    *   Temperature: 25 °C, which implies Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    *   Goals: Calculate the pH at two specific points in the titration:\n        1.  25% titration point.\n        2.  The equivalence point.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution.**\n    *   The dilution formula is M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n    *   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final Volume (V₂) = Initial Volume + Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Final Molarity (M₂) = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n    *   This is the starting concentration of the acetic acid for the titration.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration.**\n    *   The 25% titration point is in the buffer region. At this point, 25% of the initial acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n    *   We have a mixture of a weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A⁻), which forms a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer is best calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        pH = pKa + log([A⁻] / [HA])\n    *   First, calculate pKa:\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of the concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their moles.\n        Moles of A⁻ formed = 0.25 * initial moles of HA\n        Moles of HA remaining = 0.75 * initial moles of HA\n        So, [A⁻] / [HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3.\n    *   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n        pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\n\n4.  **Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO).\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻ + Na⁺ + H₂O.\n    *   The solution now contains only the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base. It will hydrolyze water to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   To find the pH, we first need to find the concentration of OH⁻. This requires an ICE table and the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Calculate Kb from Ka: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]) at the equivalence point.\n        *   Initial moles of HA = M₂ * V₂ = 0.025 M * 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles.\n        *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH added = moles of initial HA = 0.001 moles.\n        *   Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n        *   Total volume of solution = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n        *   Concentration of acetate, [A⁻] = Moles of A⁻ / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   Set up the ICE table for the hydrolysis of acetate:\n        Reaction:   A⁻      + H₂O ⇌ HA      + OH⁻\n        Initial (I):  0.02 M           0        0\n        Change (C):   -x               +x       +x\n        Equil. (E):   0.02-x           x        x\n    *   Write the Kb expression: Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   Kb ≈ x² / 0.02  =>  x = sqrt(Kb * 0.02).\n    *   Here, x = [OH⁻].\n    *   Calculate pOH = -log([OH⁻]).\n    *   Calculate pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n5.  **Step 4: Execute Calculations using Python.**\n    *   I will use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately and avoid manual errors. The script will calculate the two required pH values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given constants and initial values ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.020  # L (20.00 cm3)\nvol_water_added = 0.020   # L (20.00 cm3)\nconc_naoh = 0.1           # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution Calculation ---\nfinal_vol_acid_solution = initial_vol_acid + vol_water_added\nconc_acid_diluted = (initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid) / final_vol_acid_solution\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Calculate initial moles of diluted acid\nmoles_acid_initial = conc_acid_diluted * final_vol_acid_solution\n\n# Calculate volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point\nvol_naoh_equiv = moles_acid_initial / conc_naoh\n\n# Calculate total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_equiv = final_vol_acid_solution + vol_naoh_equiv\n\n# Calculate concentration of the conjugate base (acetate, A-) at equivalence point\n# Moles of A- formed = initial moles of acid\nconc_A_minus_equiv = moles_acid_initial / total_vol_equiv\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Set up the equilibrium calculation for A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nconc_OH_equiv = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus_equiv)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_equiv = -math.log10(conc_OH_equiv)\npH_equiv = 14 - pOH_equiv\n\n# --- Print the results ---\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_equiv:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nFinal check of the results.\n-   At 25% titration, the pH is 4.26. This is in the acidic range and below the pKa (4.73), which makes sense as there is more acid than conjugate base.\n-   At the equivalence point, the pH is 8.52. This is in the basic range, which is expected for the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, as the resulting conjugate base hydrolyzes water.\nThe calculated values (4.26 and 8.52) match option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\n*   The initial volume of the acetic acid solution is V₁ = 20.00 cm³.\n*   The initial concentration of acetic acid is M₁ = 0.05 M.\n*   The volume of water added is 20.00 cm³.\n*   The final volume of the solution is V₂ = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, we can find the new concentration (M₂) of the acetic acid:\n    M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n    This is the starting concentration of the acetic acid for the titration.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\n*   At the 25% titration point, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means the solution contains 75% HA and 25% A⁻. This is a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n*   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   The ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is [A⁻]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, we calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n    Based on the more precise calculation from the Python script, the pH is 4.26.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The solution contains only the acetate ion (A⁻), which is a weak base.\n*   First, find the moles of acetic acid we started with (before titration):\n    Moles HA = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles.\n*   Next, find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]) at the equivalence point:\n    [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We can find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] using the approximation Kb = [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]:\n    [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻]) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Now, calculate the pOH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
