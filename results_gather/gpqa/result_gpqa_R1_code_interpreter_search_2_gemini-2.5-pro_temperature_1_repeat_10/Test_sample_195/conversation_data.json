    "This problem requires us to apply the principle of conservation of energy in the context of special relativity.\n\n1.  **Define the System and Energy Components**\n    The system consists of a mass $m$ subject to a conservative force from a spring, $F = -kx$. The potential energy associated with this force is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    In special relativity, the total energy of a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. This energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$ and the kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n    The total conserved energy of our oscillating system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring.\n    $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy $E_{total}$ of the system remains constant throughout the oscillation. We can equate the total energy at two specific points in the motion:\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum amplitude (turning point).**\n        At this point, the position is $x = A$, and the mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total, 1} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n        At this point, the position is $x = 0$, and the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$. The potential energy is zero.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total, 2} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n    By the principle of conservation of energy, $E_{total, 1} = E_{total, 2}$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n3.  **Solve for the Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$)**\n    First, we solve the energy conservation equation for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to relate $\\gamma_{max}$ to $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    Squaring both sides gives:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    Rearranging to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}\\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n    Finally, we substitute the expression we found for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n4.  **Compare with Options**\n    This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
