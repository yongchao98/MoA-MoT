    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The triplet means it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks), which is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This is part of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The quartet means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (3+1=4 peaks), which is a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   This confirms the ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester (-CO**O-CH₂**-). An ether oxygen (-C-O-CH₂-) would typically be around 4.0 ppm.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** The broadness indicates that these protons are exchangeable (can be exchanged with deuterium if D₂O is added). This is characteristic of -OH or -NH protons.\n    *   Combined with the IR data, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine group (-NH₂). The chemical shift is consistent with an aniline-like amine.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This region is for aromatic protons.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded), while the protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded). This means one substituent is electron-donating, and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   From the DoU, IR, and NMR, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n    *   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring. The -NH₂ group is strongly electron-donating, so it will shield the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them upfield. The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, so it will deshield the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them downfield.\n*   This arrangement perfectly explains the aromatic signals:\n    *   The doublet at **7.0 ppm** corresponds to the 2 protons ortho to the -NH₂ group.\n    *   The doublet at **8.0 ppm** corresponds to the 2 protons ortho to the -COOCH₂CH₃ group.\n*   The final structure is therefore **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify with the Options**\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-), and the -CH₂- protons would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data and the molecular formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H peak in the IR, and the NMR would be different (e.g., a formyl proton signal >8 ppm).\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has a meta (1,3) substitution pattern, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
