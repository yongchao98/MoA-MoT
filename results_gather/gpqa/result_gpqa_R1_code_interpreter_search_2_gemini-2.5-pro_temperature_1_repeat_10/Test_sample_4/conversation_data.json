    "Answering the question requires finding the eigenvector of a specific quantum mechanical operator. Here is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n**1. Define the Operator and Direction**\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P}$ is given by its components, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThis is the standard spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle.\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in 3D is given in spherical coordinates as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For the vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This happens when $\\phi=0$. The angle $\\theta$ is the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis.\n\nSo, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**2. Construct the Operator in the direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator corresponding to the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, substitute the matrix representations:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right]$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)\\sin\\theta + (1)\\cos\\theta & (1)\\sin\\theta + (0)\\cos\\theta \\\\ (1)\\sin\\theta + (0)\\cos\\theta & (0)\\sin\\theta + (-1)\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n\nLet the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Solve for the Eigenvector**\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n1)  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2)  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\nUsing the half-angle trigonometric identities $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n$b \\, (2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = a \\, (2\\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n\nAssuming $\\theta \\neq 0$ (so that $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n$b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis gives the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, the eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $C$.\n\n**5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nThe eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) must be 1. The norm squared is given by $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\n\nWe can choose the simplest value for $C$, which is $C=1$ (as the overall phase of an eigenvector is not physically significant).\nThe normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect dimensions and normalization.\nB) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect dimensions and form.\nC) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Correct.\nD) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect form.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
