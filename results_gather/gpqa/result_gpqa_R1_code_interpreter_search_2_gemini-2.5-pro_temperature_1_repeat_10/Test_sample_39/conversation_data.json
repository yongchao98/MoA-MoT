    "*   **Analysis of the context:** The conversation is happening between two synthetic organic chemists. A key part of synthetic chemistry is not just making a new compound, but also purifying it from leftover starting materials, reagents, and any side products that may have formed.\n*   **Analysis of the phrase:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a colloquialism that implies a lack of separation. The compounds are co-located and cannot be distinguished or isolated from one another.\n*   **Evaluation of common purification techniques:**\n    *   **Distillation:** Separates liquids based on boiling point. If two compounds have similar boiling points, they will co-distill and be difficult to separate. This fits the general idea of a difficult separation.\n    *   **Chromatography (Column and Thin-Layer):** This is arguably the most common purification technique in a modern synthetic organic chemistry lab. It separates compounds based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (an eluting solvent). This affinity is primarily determined by the compound's **polarity**. Chemists often use Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) to quickly check the progress of a reaction and the purity of a sample. On a TLC plate, compounds appear as spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel up the plate at the same rate, and their spots will appear at the same height, literally \"on top of each other.\" This visual from a TLC plate is the most direct and common origin of the phrase. When this happens on a TLC plate, it tells the chemist that separation by column chromatography will be very difficult or impossible under those conditions.\n    *   **Recrystallization:** Separates solids based on differences in solubility. While a failed recrystallization is a problem, the phrase \"on top of each other\" isn't the typical way to describe it.\n*   **Comparing the options:**\n    *   A) Similar boiling points would be a problem for distillation. This is a possible meaning, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is more strongly associated with chromatography.\n    *   B) Non-covalent interactions are the underlying physical forces that determine properties like polarity and boiling point, but they are not what the chemist is directly observing or referring to with this phrase. The phrase describes the *result* of the separation attempt, not the underlying cause at a molecular level.\n    *   C) Similar polarities directly lead to a failure to separate by chromatography. The spots on a TLC plate will be \"on top of each other.\" This is the most common and direct interpretation of the phrase in this context.\n    *   D) Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules. While separating enantiomers (which have identical polarities and boiling points) is a major challenge, this specific problem is usually described as \"I can't resolve the enantiomers\" or \"I have a racemic mixture.\" The phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more general and typically refers to separation of any two compounds (e.g., product and starting material), which is based on polarity.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The chemist is most likely frustrated with their inability to separate their compounds using chromatography. This technique separates compounds based on polarity. Therefore, the statement \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common way of saying they have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
