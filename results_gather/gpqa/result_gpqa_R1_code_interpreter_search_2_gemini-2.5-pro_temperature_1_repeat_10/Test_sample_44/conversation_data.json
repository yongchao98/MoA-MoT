    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFirst, let's establish the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a given quantum number *n* (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...) is:\n$E_n = n^2 * \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$\n\nThe problem provides a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We need to express $E_n$ in terms of this unit E.\nUsing the relation $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, we can rewrite the formula for E_n:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{(2\\pi\\hbar)^2}{8mL^2} = n^2 \\frac{4\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{8mL^2} = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nSo, the energy of the n-th level is simply $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\nThe first few single-particle energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### **2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For an electron in a 1D well, the state is defined by the principal quantum number *n* and the spin quantum number *m_s* (+1/2 or -1/2). This implies that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up (↑) and one with spin-down (↓).\n\n### **3. Calculating the State Energies**\n\nWe have four particles to place into the available energy levels.\n\n**Ground State Energy ($E_{ground}$)**\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels first.\n*   We place two particles in the n=1 level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n*   We place the remaining two particles in the n=2 level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n**First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\nTo get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state to the next available unoccupied level.\n*   The ground state configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2}.\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   The new configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state.\nLet's list the total energies of possible excited configurations:\n*   **Ground State:** {2@n=1, 2@n=2} -> Total Energy = 10E\n*   **Excitation A:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: {2@n=1, 1@n=2, 1@n=3}\n    *   Total Energy = 2(1E) + 1(4E) + 1(9E) = 15E. (This is the first excited state).\n*   **Excitation B:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: {1@n=1, 2@n=2, 1@n=3}\n    *   Total Energy = 1(1E) + 2(4E) + 1(9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Excitation C:** Move both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: {2@n=1, 2@n=3}\n    *   Total Energy = 2(1E) + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Excitation D:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: {2@n=1, 1@n=2, 1@n=4}\n    *   Total Energy = 2(1E) + 1(4E) + 1(16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the states:\n1.  Ground State: 10E\n2.  First Excited State (Excitation A): 15E\n3.  Second Excited State (Excitation B): 18E\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
