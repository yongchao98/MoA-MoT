    "The user is describing a classic immunology experiment. Let's break it down:\n1.  **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (the antigen) are delivered orally. This means the immune response will be mounted in the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT).\n2.  **Immune Response Location:** The fluorescence is observed in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are secondary lymphoid organs, a key component of the GALT. This is where adaptive immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated. Specifically, this is the site of germinal center formation.\n3.  **Cellular Activity:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. In response to an antigen, B cells that recognize it undergo rapid proliferation (clonal expansion) within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs.\n4.  **Genetic Observation:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" shows \"high variability.\" The variable region of an antibody (and the B cell receptor) is what binds to the antigen.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options in the context of this B cell response in a germinal center:\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's effector function. It does *not* affect the *variable* region, so it doesn't explain the high variability observed there.\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a protein cascade that helps clear pathogens. It is not involved in generating genetic diversity in B cells.\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs specifically in activated, proliferating B cells within germinal centers. The enzyme Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID) introduces point mutations at a high rate into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different antigen receptors. Subsequent selection for B cells with the highest affinity for the antigen leads to affinity maturation. SHM is the direct cause of the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of this specific B cell population.\n*   **D) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially creates the diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in developing B cells in the bone marrow, *before* they encounter an antigen. While it generates diversity, the question describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure in a specific, proliferating population, which is characteristic of SHM, not the initial VDJ recombination event.\n\nTherefore, the process causing high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a Peyer's patch after antigen exposure is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
