    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   It's a benzene ring with three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n    *   The substitution pattern is vicinal (1,2,3).\n    *   Let's analyze the directing effects of these groups for electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n        *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n        *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, ortho, para-director.\n        *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Feasibility of Direct Substitution:**\n    The final arrangement has the -NO2 group meta to the -OEt group and ortho to the -tBu group. If we were to perform nitration on a precursor like 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene, the directing effects of both the -OEt (strong o,p) and -tBu (o,p) groups would direct the incoming electrophile to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. This means a direct, final-step nitration is unlikely to work in high yield. This suggests a more complex pathway involving functional group manipulation or the use of blocking groups is required.\n\n3.  **Propose a Plausible Synthetic Strategy:**\n    A common strategy for complex substitution patterns is to use an amino group (-NH2) as a powerful director, which can later be converted into other functional groups (like -OH, and then -OEt) via a diazonium salt.\n\n    Let's try to build the molecule retrosynthetically, assuming the ethoxy group comes from an amino group.\n    *   **Final Step:** The -OEt group can be made from a phenol (-OH) via Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n    *   **Precursor to Phenol:** The phenol can be made from a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis (`H2O/Heat`).\n    *   **Required Amine:** This means the immediate precursor before these final steps must be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n    Now, the problem is how to synthesize 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline in high yield.\n    *   We can start by making **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n        *   Benzene + `t-BuCl/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation) -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        *   tert-Butylbenzene + `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration) -> o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (minor product) and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product). We would need to separate the ortho isomer.\n        *   o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + `Fe/HCl` (Reduction) -> o-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   Now, we need to nitrate o-tert-butylaniline to introduce a nitro group at the desired position (position 3 relative to the final numbering, which is position 3 in the o-tert-butylaniline intermediate).\n    *   Direct nitration of o-tert-butylaniline is problematic. In strongly acidic media (`HNO3/H2SO4`), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. In o-tert-butylanilinium (t-Bu at C2, -NH3+ at C1), both groups direct incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5. Position 5 (para to t-Bu) is favored over position 3 (ortho to t-Bu) due to sterics. This would lead to a low yield of the desired 3-nitro isomer.\n    *   **High-Yield Strategy using a Blocking Group:** To force nitration at position 3, we can block the more favorable position 5.\n        1.  Start with **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n        2.  Sulfonate the ring (`SO3/H2SO4`). The directing groups (-NH3+ and -tBu) will direct the -SO3H group to position 5. This gives **2-tert-butylaniline-5-sulfonic acid**.\n        3.  Now, nitrate this compound (`HNO3/H2SO4`). The directing effects of all three groups (-NH3+, -tBu, -SO3H) now converge on the only available activated position, C3. This gives **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline-5-sulfonic acid** in high yield.\n        4.  Remove the blocking group via desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`, heat) to get **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   This multi-step process provides the required amine precursor in high yield.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Full High-Yield Synthesis and Compare with Options:**\n    The complete, high-yield sequence of reactions is:\n    1.  `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`\n    2.  `HNO3/H2SO4` (followed by isomer separation)\n    3.  `Fe/HCl`\n    4.  `SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation/Blocking)\n    5.  `HNO3/H2SO4` (Directed Nitration)\n    6.  `dilute H2SO4` (Desulfonation/Deblocking)\n    7.  `NaNO2/HCl` (Diazotization)\n    8.  `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (Hydrolysis to phenol)\n    9.  `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson Ether Synthesis)\n\n    Now let's examine the given options:\n    *   **A)** Fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is not effective.\n    *   **B)** Fails at step (iv). It reduces a nitro group that is required in the final product. The sequence is illogical.\n    *   **D)** Fails at step (iv). It attempts to diazotize a molecule that is not a primary amine.\n    *   **C)** i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` ; ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` ; iii) `Fe/HCl` ; iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` ; v) `NaNO2/HCl` ; vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` ; vii) `NaOH/EtBr` ; viii) `SO3/H2SO4` ; ix) `dilute H2SO4`\n\n    Comparing the reagent list from our derived high-yield synthesis with Option C, we find that **the set of reagents is identical**. However, the order in Option C is incorrect. It places the crucial blocking/deblocking steps (sulfonation/desulfonation) at the very end, where they serve no purpose, and it attempts the key nitration step (iv) without the blocking group, which would lead to low yield.\n\n    Given that options A, B, and D contain fundamental chemical impossibilities, Option C is the only plausible answer, despite the error in the ordering of the steps. It is highly probable that the question intended to represent the correct sequence of reactions but listed the steps in the wrong order. Option C contains all the necessary transformations for the correct, high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>"
