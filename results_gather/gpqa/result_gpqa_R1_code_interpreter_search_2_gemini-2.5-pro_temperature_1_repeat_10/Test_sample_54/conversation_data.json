    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the signals and their implications.**\n    *   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is a typical chemical shift for protons of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an acetyl group, CH₃-C=O).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** The signal corresponds to three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** These protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This confirms the presence of an isolated CH₃ group, very characteristic of an acetate ester fragment (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). All four options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n    *   **Signal 2: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinylic) proton region. The value is quite high (downfield), suggesting the proton is on a double bond and is deshielded, likely by an adjacent electronegative atom like oxygen.\n        *   **Integration (1H):** The signal corresponds to one proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information in this signal. For protons on a double bond (vicinal coupling, H-C=C-H), a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) is characteristic of a *trans* relationship. A smaller J value (6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* relationship. Therefore, the J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* double bond. This allows us to eliminate the *cis* isomers: Cis-propenyl acetate (B) and Cis-butenyl acetate (A).\n    *   **Signal 3: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical shift for an allylic methyl group (a CH₃ group attached to a C=C double bond).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to a methyl group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This suggests a CH₃-CH= fragment.\n    *   **Signal 4: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic proton region.\n        *   **Integration (1H):** Corresponds to one proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to a single proton, and the \"quartet\" part arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the structure from the fragments.**\n    *   From the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n        1.  An acetate group: -O-C(=O)-CH₃\n        2.  A *trans* double bond: -CH=CH-\n        3.  A methyl group attached to the double bond, which is coupled to one vinylic proton: CH₃-CH=\n    *   Putting these together gives the structure CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃. This is **propenyl acetate**. Since we determined the double bond is *trans*, the compound must be **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n    *   Let's verify this structure against the full spectrum:\n        *   **Structure:** `CH₃(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)`\n        *   **Protons (d):** The acetyl methyl group. Isolated. Will be a singlet at ~2.1 ppm. (Matches `2.1 (3H, s)`)\n        *   **Proton (a):** Vinylic proton attached to the oxygen. It is deshielded, so it will be the furthest downfield. It is coupled only to proton (b). It will be a doublet with a large J value for the *trans* coupling. (Matches `7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`)\n        *   **Proton (b):** Vinylic proton attached to the methyl group. It is coupled to proton (a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of methyl group (c) (giving a quartet). The overall multiplicity will be a doublet of quartets. (Matches `5.5 (1H, dq)`)\n        *   **Protons (c):** The allylic methyl group. It is coupled to the single proton (b). It will be a doublet. (Matches `1.6 (3H, d)`)\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare with the remaining option.**\n    *   The other remaining option is Trans-butenyl acetate. A simple butenyl group would be CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-. This would introduce a CH₂ group, which would show up as an additional signal (likely a multiplet) and would change the splitting of the adjacent protons. The given NMR data does not have signals for a CH₂ group. The total proton count in the data is 1+1+3+3 = 8H, which matches the formula for propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂), not butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂), which would have 10H.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The 1H NMR data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
