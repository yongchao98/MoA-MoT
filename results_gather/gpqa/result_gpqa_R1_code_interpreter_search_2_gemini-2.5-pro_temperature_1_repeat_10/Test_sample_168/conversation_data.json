    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Original Decay Process\n\n*   **Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n*   **Particles:**\n    *   `A`, `B`: Heavy nucleons.\n    *   `E`, `V`: Much lighter particles.\n*   **Energy Spectrum of E:** The problem states the total energy spectrum of the two `E` particles is **continuous**. This is a crucial piece of information.\n*   **Reason for Continuous Spectrum:** In any decay that produces three or more particles in the final state (a \"multi-body decay\"), the available energy is shared among them in a variable way. In this case, the final state has `2B + 2E + 2V`, a total of 6 particles. The two `V` particles can carry away a variable amount of kinetic energy. Consequently, the energy remaining for the two `E` particles also varies, resulting in a continuous energy spectrum for them.\n*   **Endpoint (Q):** The endpoint of this spectrum is the maximum possible total kinetic energy of the two `E` particles. This maximum is achieved when the other particles in the final state (`2B` and `2V`) carry away the minimum possible energy.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Variant Decay Process\n\n*   **Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n*   **Particles:**\n    *   `M`: An exotic, **massless** particle. It replaces the two `V` particles.\n*   **Energy Spectrum of E:** The final state now consists of `2B + 2E + M`, a total of 5 particles. Since this is still a multi-body decay (more than two final particles), the available energy will be shared among them. The massless particle `M` can carry away a variable amount of kinetic energy. Therefore, the energy left for the `E` particles is still variable.\n*   **Conclusion 1:** The total energy spectrum of the `E` particles **remains continuous**. This immediately rules out options A and B, which claim the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n### 3. Compare the Endpoints of the Spectra\n\nThe endpoint of the `E` particle energy spectrum is determined by the total energy released in the decay, which must account for both the kinetic energy and the rest mass energy of all final particles.\n\nLet's define the energy released by the nuclear transition as `Q_nuc = (2 * m_A - 2 * m_B) * c^2`. This is the total energy that gets converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the light particles (`E`, `V`, `M`). We can ignore the small recoil kinetic energy of the heavy `B` nucleons for this analysis.\n\n*   **Original Decay Endpoint:**\n    *   The energy `Q_nuc` is distributed among the final light particles: `Q_nuc = (Total Energy of 2E) + (Total Energy of 2V)`.\n    *   Total energy includes rest mass energy (`mc^2`) and kinetic energy (`K`).\n    *   `Q_nuc = (2 * m_E * c^2 + K_E_total) + (2 * m_V * c^2 + K_V_total)`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy available to be shared is `K_shared_orig = K_E_total + K_V_total = Q_nuc - 2 * m_E * c^2 - 2 * m_V * c^2`.\n    *   The endpoint of the `E` spectrum, `max(K_E_total)`, occurs when the other light particles (`V`) take away the minimum possible kinetic energy, i.e., `K_V_total = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, `Endpoint_orig = Q_nuc - 2 * m_E * c^2 - 2 * m_V * c^2`.\n\n*   **Variant Decay Endpoint:**\n    *   The energy `Q_nuc` is distributed as: `Q_nuc = (Total Energy of 2E) + (Total Energy of M)`.\n    *   `Q_nuc = (2 * m_E * c^2 + K_E_total) + (m_M * c^2 + K_M)`.\n    *   We are given that `M` is massless, so `m_M = 0`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy available to be shared is `K_shared_var = K_E_total + K_M = Q_nuc - 2 * m_E * c^2`.\n    *   The endpoint, `max(K_E_total)`, occurs when `K_M = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, `Endpoint_var = Q_nuc - 2 * m_E * c^2`.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   `Endpoint_var = Q_nuc - 2 * m_E * c^2`\n    *   `Endpoint_orig = Q_nuc - 2 * m_E * c^2 - 2 * m_V * c^2`\n    *   The difference is `Endpoint_var - Endpoint_orig = 2 * m_V * c^2`.\n    *   The problem describes `V` as a \"lighter particle\", which implies it has a mass (`m_V > 0`). In the context of nuclear decay, `V` is analogous to a neutrino, which is now known to have a small but non-zero mass.\n    *   Since `m_V > 0`, the difference `2 * m_V * c^2` is positive.\n    *   This means `Endpoint_var > Endpoint_orig`.\n\n*   **Conclusion 2:** The endpoint of the `E` particle energy spectrum **increases**.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nCombining our findings:\n1.  The spectrum remains **continuous**.\n2.  The shape is adjusted because the number of particles in the final state (and thus the phase space) is different.\n3.  The endpoint **increases**.\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
