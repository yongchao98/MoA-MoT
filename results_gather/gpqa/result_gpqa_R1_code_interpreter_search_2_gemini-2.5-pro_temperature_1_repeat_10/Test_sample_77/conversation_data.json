    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:** The problem involves calculating the electromagnetic potentials from a moving point charge. Unlike the static case, the field at a point `r` at time `t` is not determined by the charge's position at time `t`. Instead, because electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light `c`, the potentials are determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time**, `tr`.\n\n2.  **Define Variables based on the problem statement:**\n    *   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n    *   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `tr`: The retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (the field) was emitted from the charge to reach point `r` at time `t`.\n    *   `d`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`. Thus, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   `d`: The magnitude of the vector `d`, i.e., the distance from the retarded position to the observation point. `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n    *   `c`: The speed of light in vacuum.\n    *   `ε₀`: The permittivity of free space.\n    *   `μ₀`: The permeability of free space.\n\n3.  **Relate Observation Time and Retarded Time:** The time it takes for the signal to travel the distance `d` is `d/c`. Therefore, the observation time `t` is related to the retarded time `tr` by:\n    `t = tr + d/c` or `t - tr = d/c`.\n\n4.  **Recall the General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:** The general solutions for the potentials from time-varying charge density `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')` are the retarded potentials:\n    *   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    where `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\n5.  **Apply to a Moving Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)` and velocity `v(t)`, the charge and current densities are:\n    *   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))` (where `δ³` is the 3D Dirac delta function)\n    *   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Integrals (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):** Substituting these densities into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals is a standard but non-trivial derivation in electromagnetism. The key subtlety is that the retarded time `tr` depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration is the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    The standard result from textbooks (e.g., Griffiths, \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") for the scalar potential is:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\n    Let's manipulate this expression to match the format in the options. We can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (c(d - d ⋅ v / c))]`\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (cd - d ⋅ v)]`\n\n    This matches the scalar potential part of option B.\n\n7.  **Derive the Vector Potential:** The vector potential `A` is found similarly. A simpler way is to note the relationship between the charge and current densities (`J = ρv`). This leads to a simple relationship between the potentials:\n    `A(r, t) = (v / c²) * V(r, t)`\n    (This relationship holds because `μ₀ε₀ = 1/c²`).\n\n    Substituting our expression for `V(r, t)`:\n    `A(r, t) = (v / c²) * [(1 / 4πε₀) * (qc / (cd - d ⋅ v))]`\n    Using `μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²)`:\n    `A(r, t) = μ₀ε₀v * [(1 / 4πε₀) * (qc / (cd - d ⋅ v))]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qcv / (cd - d ⋅ v)]`\n\n    This matches the vector potential part of option B.\n\n8.  **Compare with all options:**\n    *   **A) V(...) = ... / (dc + d.v), A(...) = ... / (dc + d.v)**: Incorrect sign in the denominator. This would imply the potential gets weaker as the charge moves towards the observer, which is contrary to the Doppler-like \"bunching\" of field lines.\n    *   **B) V(...) = ... / (dc - d.v), A(...) = ... / (dc - d.v)**: Correct. Both the scalar and vector potentials match the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **C) V(...) = q / (4πε₀ r), ...**: This is the static Coulomb potential. It neglects retardation and the motion of the charge. It is incorrect.\n    *   **D) V(...) = q / (4πε₀ r), ...**: Same incorrect static potential as C.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
