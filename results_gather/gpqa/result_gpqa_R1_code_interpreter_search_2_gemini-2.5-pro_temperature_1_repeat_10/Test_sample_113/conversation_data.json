    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   Reactants: butan-2-one (a ketone), NaCN (sodium cyanide), and reagent A.\n    *   Product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin).\n    *   The reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to a ketone, forming a cyanohydrin.\n    *   The mechanism involves two steps:\n        1.  The cyanide ion (:CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        2.  The negatively charged oxygen of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin.\n    *   This protonation is achieved by adding an acid. In a typical laboratory procedure, this is done in a separate workup step using a dilute strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄, which is represented generically as H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion).\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for A:\n        *   **H₃O⁺**: This is the correct choice. It provides the proton needed to complete the cyanohydrin formation.\n        *   **NaHSO₃**: Sodium bisulfite. This reagent also adds to carbonyl compounds, but it forms a bisulfite addition product (an α-hydroxy sulfonate), not a cyanohydrin. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   Reactant: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (a nitrile).\n    *   Reagents: B and H₂O.\n    *   Product: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (a carboxylic acid).\n    *   The transformation is the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This reaction is called nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be carried out under either strongly acidic or strongly basic conditions, typically with heating.\n    *   **Acidic Hydrolysis**: Heating the nitrile with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) directly yields the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Basic Hydrolysis**: Heating the nitrile with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH) first produces a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻). A subsequent acidification step is required to get the final carboxylic acid (R-COOH).\n    *   Since the reaction shown directly produces the carboxylic acid, it represents an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for B:\n        *   **HCl**: A strong acid, which is a standard and effective reagent for the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **CH₃COOH**: Acetic acid. This is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid in a reasonable timeframe.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, reagent A must be H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, reagent B must be HCl.\n    *   Therefore, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
