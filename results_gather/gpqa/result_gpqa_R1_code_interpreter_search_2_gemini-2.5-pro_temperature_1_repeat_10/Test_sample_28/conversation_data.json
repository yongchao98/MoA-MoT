    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein produced by the gene. The goal is to create a non-functional protein. The most effective ways to do this are by introducing a nonsense mutation (a premature stop codon) or a frameshift mutation, which alters the entire downstream amino acid sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the sequences by breaking them down into codons (three-base-pair units) and translating them into amino acids. The start codon is `ATG`.\n\n**1. Intact Gene Analysis**\n\n*   **DNA:** 5’-`ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` `GGT` `ACT` ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...\n    This is the original, functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n**2. Mutant 1 Analysis**\n\n*   **Intact:** 5’-ATG TTT **CTC** GCT...-3’\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC **TAC** GCT...-3’\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   The second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**.\n*   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - Thr ...\n*   **Effect:** This mutation changes a single amino acid in the protein chain. While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n\n**3. Mutant 2 Analysis**\n\n*   **Intact:** 5’-ATG TTT **CTC** GCT...-3’\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC **TAA** GCT...-3’\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   The second codon `TTT` (Phe) is changed to `TTC` (Phe), which is a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon, causing protein synthesis to terminate after only two amino acids. The resulting polypeptide is extremely short and will almost certainly be non-functional. This is the most effective way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n**4. Mutant 3 Analysis**\n\n*   **Intact:** 5’-ATG TTT **CTC** GCT GGT **ACT**...-3’\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT **TAC** GCT GGT **GTC**...-3’\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   The sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n*   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** ...\n*   **Effect:** This sequence has two **missense mutations**, changing two amino acids. Similar to Mutant 1, this might alter the protein but is less likely to completely eliminate its function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n**5. Mutant 4 Analysis**\n\n*   **Intact:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT **GGT** ACT...-3’\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’ (Note: The provided sequence for Mutant 4, `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...`, suggests an in-frame deletion of the `GGT` codon, among other changes. We will analyze the most likely intended mutation, an in-frame deletion.)\n*   **Change:** The fifth codon, `GGT` (Glycine), is deleted.\n*   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Thr ...\n*   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. While removing an amino acid can be disruptive, it is not as certain to destroy function as introducing an early stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the effects, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most catastrophic for the protein's synthesis. It stops the process near the very beginning, ensuring that no functional protein is made. This makes it the mutation most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
