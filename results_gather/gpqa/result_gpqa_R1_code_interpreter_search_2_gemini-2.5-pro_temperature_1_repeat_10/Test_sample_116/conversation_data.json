    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups), but other sources of chirality exist, such as axial chirality (atropisomerism). A key test for achirality (not being chiral) is the presence of an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Molecule 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. Two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism if there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. This restriction occurs when there are bulky substituents in the ortho positions (the positions next to the connecting bond, i.e., 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'.\n    *   These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar (lying in the same plane) due to steric hindrance. The molecule is forced into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   This twisted conformation does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. It is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. A central carbonyl group (C=O) is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. We can look for planes of symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to the presence of this plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond (a *trans* configuration).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Therefore, it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Summary**\n    *   Molecule 1: Chiral (atropisomerism) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Molecule 2: Chiral (chiral center) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Molecule 3: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Molecule 4: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
