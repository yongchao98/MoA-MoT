    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift of light from their host star. The star wobbles as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's velocity.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) to the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the star:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light. The problem gives the *amplitude* of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$). This amplitude is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    $$ K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max} $$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two stars is equal to the ratio of their wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = 1.4 $$\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** We need to find the physical relationship between $K$ and the orbital period $P$. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude is given by:\n    $$ K = \\frac{2\\pi a_* \\sin(i)}{P} $$\n    where $a_*$ is the radius of the star's orbit around the system's center of mass, $P$ is the orbital period, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n4.  **Use Center of Mass and Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   From the definition of the center of mass, $M_* a_* = m_p a_p$, where $M_*$ and $m_p$ are the star and planet masses, and $a_p$ is the planet's orbital radius. The total separation is $a = a_* + a_p$. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's ($m_p \\ll M_*$, as stated in the problem), we can approximate $a \\approx a_p$. Therefore, $a_* \\approx a \\frac{m_p}{M_*}$.\n    *   Kepler's Third Law, for $m_p \\ll M_*$, states:\n        $$ P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_*} a^3 $$\n    *   We can solve this for the orbital radius $a$:\n        $$ a = \\left( \\frac{G M_* P^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n5.  **Derive the Final Relationship:** Now substitute the expressions for $a_*$ and $a$ into the equation for $K$:\n    $$ K = \\frac{2\\pi \\sin(i)}{P} \\left(a \\frac{m_p}{M_*}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi m_p \\sin(i)}{P M_*} \\left( \\frac{G M_* P^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n    Simplifying this expression shows how $K$ depends on $P$:\n    $$ K = \\frac{(2\\pi G)^{1/3} m_p \\sin(i)}{M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3}} $$\n    This equation tells us that $K$ is proportional to $P^{-1/3}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Period Ratio:** The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{*1} = M_{*2}$) and the planets have the same mass ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$). We assume the orbital inclinations are statistically similar, so we can take $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$. Under these conditions, all terms in the expression for $K$ are constant for both systems except for $P$.\n    $$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n    We can write this as a ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown:** We know $K_2/K_1 = 1.4$. We want to find the ratio $P_2/P_1$.\n    $$ 1.4 = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n    Cube both sides to solve for $P_1/P_2$:\n    $$ (1.4)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n    $$ 2.744 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n    Finally, invert the fraction to get the desired ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    This value is closest to option D.\n\nTo get a precise calculation, we can use a short python script.\n```python\n# The ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes (K2/K1) is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\nK_ratio = 7 / 5\n\n# The relationship between the velocity amplitude K and the orbital period P is K ‚àù P^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, K2/K1 = (P2/P1)^(-1/3).\n# We want to find the ratio P2/P1.\n# P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^(-3)\n\nperiod_ratio = K_ratio**(-3)\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804675\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital periods ($P_2/P_1$) of two exoplanets. Here is the breakdown of the physics and calculations involved.\n\n### Key Concepts and Relationships\n\n1.  **Radial Velocity (RV) and Doppler Shift**: The periodic shift in the wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of light from a star is caused by its \"wobble\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. This wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The amplitude of the radial velocity variation, denoted by $K$, is therefore directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$).\n    \n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\n2.  **Stellar Velocity Amplitude (K)**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n    \n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_*^{2/3}}$\n    \n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_*$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n### Applying the Concepts to the Problem\n\n1.  **Ratio of Velocity Amplitudes**: We are given the wavelength shifts for the two systems. We can find the ratio of their stellar velocity amplitudes ($K_1$ and $K_2$).\n    \n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Deriving the Period Ratio**: The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{*1} = M_{*2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$). We can also assume that the orbital inclinations ($i$) are statistically similar and can be treated as equal for this comparison.\n    \n    Under these conditions, most terms in the formula for $K$ are constant for both systems. The relationship between $K$ and $P$ simplifies to:\n    \n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n    \n    We can write this as a ratio:\n    \n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Solving for the Period Ratio ($P_2/P_1$)**: We need to solve for $P_2/P_1$.\n    \n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3}$\n    \n    Substitute the value of the velocity ratio we found in step 1:\n    \n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (1.4)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{1.4^3} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n    \n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis result means that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. This matches option D. The code execution confirmed this calculation precisely.\n\n<<<D>>>"
