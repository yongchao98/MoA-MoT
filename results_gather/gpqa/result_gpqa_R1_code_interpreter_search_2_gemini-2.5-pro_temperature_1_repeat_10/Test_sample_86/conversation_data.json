    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement to identify the key features of the molecule.**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond:** This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the identity of the two substituents.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms, which include 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Let's verify the total atom count. The molecule is a haloacetophenone. Its formula is C6H4(X)(COCH3). The total carbons are 6 (from the ring) + 2 (from the acetyl group) = 8. This matches the problem description.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the number of protons and their expected chemical environments.**\n    *   The molecule has the formula C8H7XO.\n    *   There are protons in two distinct regions:\n        1.  The aromatic ring: The di-substituted ring has 4 protons (C6H4).\n        2.  The acetyl group: The methyl group (-CH3) has 3 protons.\n    *   The total number of protons is 4 + 3 = 7. Let's check the integration in the options:\n        *   A) 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H\n        *   B) 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H\n        *   C) 1H + 2H + 2H + 2H = 7H\n        *   D) 1H + 2H + 2H + 2H = 7H\n    *   All options have the correct total number of protons. We must analyze the chemical shifts and splitting patterns.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum based on the possible structures (isomers).**\n    *   The two substituents, -X and -COCH3, can be arranged in ortho, meta, or para positions.\n    *   **The acetyl group (-COCH3):** The 3 protons on the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl, not another carbon with protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Their chemical shift is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **The aromatic protons:** The appearance of the 4 aromatic protons depends on the substitution pattern.\n        *   *Ortho* and *meta* substitution would lead to complex splitting patterns, with potentially four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n        *   *Para* (1,4) substitution creates a plane of symmetry in the molecule. This makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group chemically equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other. This results in a much simpler spectrum. We expect to see two signals for the aromatic protons. Because these two sets of protons are adjacent to each other, they will split each other into **two doublets (d)**. Both the acetyl group and the halogen are electron-withdrawing, so the aromatic proton signals will be in the downfield region, typically **7.0-8.0 ppm**. The protons ortho to the strongly deactivating carbonyl group will be the most downfield.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n    *   Let's look for an option that shows:\n        1.  A singlet for 3H around 2.3 ppm.\n        2.  Two doublets for 2H each in the 7-8 ppm range.\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d)** and **7.6 (2H, d):** These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the aromatic region. This is the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons in the expected region for a methyl ketone (-COCH3).\n        *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. Also, the problem specifies an aromatic-halogen bond, but the structure corresponding to this spectrum would likely be p-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, which has an aliphatic-halogen bond. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals and splitting patterns do not match our predicted structure. The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 are not in the aromatic region, and the integration (1H, 2H, 2H, 2H) doesn't fit with a -CH3 group. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a para-substituted haloacetophenone, and the NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
