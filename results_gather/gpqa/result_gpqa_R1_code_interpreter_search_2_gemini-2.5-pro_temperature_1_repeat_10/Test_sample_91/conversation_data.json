    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of atoms and bonds.\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's count the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   (CH3)2C: 1 central C + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C; 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n*   =CH-: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   -CH(CH3)-: 1 C on the chain + 1 C in the methyl group = 2 C; 1 H on the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H.\n*   -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   -CH=: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   =C(CH3)2: 1 central C + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C; 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n\nTotal Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 C.\nTotal Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H.\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number and Types of Bonds**\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two double bonds: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -C**H=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds**: We can count them from the structure, or use a formula for acyclic molecules. For an acyclic molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds (single, double, triple) is (Number of C atoms) - 1.\n    *   Total C-C framework bonds = 12 - 1 = 11.\n    *   Since we have 2 C=C bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   C-H bonds: 22\n*   C-C bonds: 9\n*   C=C bonds: 2\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe formation of one mole of C12H22 occurs from its elements in their standard states:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to turn these reactants into gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) and 22 H(g).\n*   **Energy to atomize Carbon**: 12 mol * (Enthalpy of atomization of C)\n    = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **Energy to atomize Hydrogen**: This is the energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    = 11 mol * (Bond energy of H-H)\n    = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization (Reactants)** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the C12H22 molecule is formed from its gaseous atoms.\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds**: 22 * (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds**: 9 * (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds**: 2 * (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total Bond Energy (Product)** = 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when forming the product bonds.\nΔH_f = (Total Enthalpy of Atomization) - (Total Bond Energy)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n**ΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Compare with Options and Convert Units**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy, not the enthalpy of formation)\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value is correct, but the unit is per gram, not per mole)\nD) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nThere is a discrepancy in the units for option C. Let's convert our answer from kJ/mol to kJ/g to check option B.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22**:\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 * Atomic Mass of C) + (22 * Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   Molar Mass ≈ (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n*   **Convert to kJ/g**:\n    *   Enthalpy (kJ/g) = Enthalpy (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   Enthalpy (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B. Given that option C has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (1900 kJ/g is physically derived from our numbers only if the molar mass were 1 g/mol), and option B is a correct unit conversion of our calculated result, option B is the most plausible answer.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculations:\n```python\n# Given values\nH_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nBE_HH = 100      # kJ/mol\nBE_CC = 200      # kJ/mol\nBE_C_eq_C = 300  # kJ/mol\nBE_CH = 400      # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of moles of H2 gas\nnum_H2 = num_H / 2\n\n# Number of bonds in the molecule C12H22\n# Degree of Unsaturation = C + 1 - H/2 = 12 + 1 - 22/2 = 2 (two double bonds)\nnum_bonds_CH = 22\nnum_bonds_C_eq_C = 2\n# Total C-C framework bonds = num_C - 1 = 11\nnum_bonds_CC = 11 - num_bonds_C_eq_C\n\n# 1. Calculate enthalpy of atomization of reactants (12 C(s) + 11 H2(g))\nenthalpy_atom_reactants = (num_C * H_atom_C) + (num_H2 * BE_HH)\n\n# 2. Calculate total bond energy of the product molecule\ntotal_bond_energy_product = (num_bonds_CC * BE_CC) + (num_bonds_C_eq_C * BE_C_eq_C) + (num_bonds_CH * BE_CH)\n\n# 3. Calculate enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_formation_mol = enthalpy_atom_reactants - total_bond_energy_product\n\n# 4. Calculate molar mass of C12H22 (using integer masses C=12, H=1)\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\n\n# 5.

    "An enthalpy of formation calculation involves determining the energy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The process can be broken down using a Hess's Law cycle involving atomization energies and bond energies.\n\n**1. Write the Formation Reaction:**\nThe formation of the compound, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, from its elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**2. Determine Molecular Formula and Bond Count:**\n*   First, we determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms in the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    *   Carbons (C): 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n    *   Molecular Formula: **C12H22**\n*   Next, we count the types of bonds in one molecule:\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly indicates two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** In an acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds is one less than the number of carbon atoms.\n        *   Total C-C framework bonds = 12 - 1 = 11.\n        *   Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy Change for Reactant Atomization (ΔH_reactants):**\nThis is the energy required to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\n*   **Atomization of Carbon:** 12 mol × (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **Atomization of Hydrogen:** To get 22 H atoms, we need to break 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    *   11 mol × (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Energy Input (ΔH_reactants):** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy Change for Product Formation from Atoms (ΔH_products):**\nThis is the energy released when one mole of C12H22 is formed from its gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies in the molecule, taken as a negative value since bond formation is exothermic.\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 × (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 × (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 × (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total Energy Released (Bond Energy of Product):** 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the net energy change, which is the energy required to break the reactant bonds minus the energy released forming the product bonds.\nΔH_f = (Energy for reactant atomization) - (Total bond energy of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Compare with Options:**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options.\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy of the product)\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 1900 kJ/g (The value is correct, but the unit is incorrect)\nD) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nSince none of the options match 1900 kJ/mol directly, we should check the units. Option B is in kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to these units.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   M = 12 × (atomic mass of C) + 22 × (atomic mass of H)\n    *   M = 12 × 12.0 g/mol + 22 × 1.0 g/mol = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n*   **Convert ΔH_f to kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.45 kJ/g**\n\nThis value (11.45 kJ/g) is very close to option B (11.44 kJ/g). The small difference is likely due to rounding in the given bond energy values or the options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
