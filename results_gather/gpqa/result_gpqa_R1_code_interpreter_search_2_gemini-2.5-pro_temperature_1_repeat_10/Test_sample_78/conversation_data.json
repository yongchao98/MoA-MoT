    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. We are given its ¹H and ¹³C NMR data and the molecular formula of the starting material, C₁₁H₁₂O. Since the reaction is a rearrangement (isomerization), the product will have the same molecular formula.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 DoU.\n    *   This leaves 2 DoU, which likely correspond to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a conjugated ketone or aldehyde.\n    *   **δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C):** These 8 carbons are in the alkene/aromatic region (δ 100-150 ppm).\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C), 28.4 (1C):** These are two aliphatic carbons, likely methyl groups.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** A singlet for 3 protons in the aromatic methyl region (~2.3 ppm). This is consistent with a methyl group attached to the benzene ring. Combining these observations, we can identify a **p-tolyl group** (CH₃-C₆H₄-). This fragment accounts for C₇H₇.\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** Another singlet for 3 protons. This is likely another methyl group. The chemical shift suggests it might be an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃), especially since we know a carbonyl group is present.\n    *   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and 6.75 (1H, d):** Two doublets, each for one proton, in the vinyl region. This indicates a **disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-)** where the two protons are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    1.  A p-tolyl group (CH₃-C₆H₄-)\n    2.  A carbonyl group (-C=O)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A vinyl group (-CH=CH-)\n\n    Let's assemble them to match the formula C₁₁H₁₂O and the spectroscopic data. The most logical structure is an α,β-unsaturated ketone: **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    Structure: `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n\n    Let's verify this structure with the data:\n    *   **Formula:** C₇H₇ (p-tolyl) + C₄H₅O (butenone part) = C₁₁H₁₂O. Correct.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** p-tolyl group (methyl singlet at ~2.3 ppm, two aromatic doublets) + acetyl methyl singlet (~2.3 ppm) + two vinyl protons as doublets. This perfectly matches the provided data. The vinyl proton β to the carbonyl (Ar-CH=) is more deshielded (δ 7.68) than the α proton (=CH-C=O, δ 6.75), which is expected.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The presence of a conjugated ketone, a p-disubstituted ring, a vinyl group, and two distinct methyl groups is fully consistent with the ¹³C data.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Compound X**\n\nNow that we know the product, we need to work backward to find the starting material, Compound X.\n\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base), nonpolar solvent, high temperature (403 K = 130 °C).\n*   **Transformation:** Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) → 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The conditions and the transformation from an epoxide (as suggested by the options) to an α,β-unsaturated ketone point towards a **base-catalyzed rearrangement of an allylic epoxide**. An allylic epoxide is a molecule containing both an epoxide ring and an adjacent C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:** We need to find the option that can rearrange to form 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. A crucial point is that the product contains a **p-tolyl group**. It is highly improbable for a p-tolyl group to be formed from a phenyl group under these conditions. Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a p-tolyl group.\n\n    Let's examine the options:\n    *   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Contains a styryl group (phenyl-CH=CH-). It has a **phenyl** group, not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n    *   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Contains a **phenyl** group. Incorrect.\n    *   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** Contains a 4-methylstyryl group, which is `p-tolyl-CH=CH-`. This molecule has the required **p-tolyl** group and the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O). Its structure is `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This is an allylic epoxide.\n    *   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** Contains a **phenyl** group and has an incorrect molecular formula (C₁₀H₁₀O). Incorrect.\n\n*   **Mechanism Check:** Only option C is a plausible candidate. Let's verify the mechanism. The rearrangement of 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane to 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one is a known transformation. The base (DABCO) removes the acidic proton on the carbon that is both part of the epoxide and allylic to the double bond. The resulting anion rearranges, the epoxide ring opens, and subsequent tautomerization of the resulting enol yields the final α,β-unsaturated ketone product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe product of the reaction is unambiguously identified as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one from the NMR data. By examining the provided options for the starting material (Compound X), only option C contains the necessary p-tolyl group to form this product. The reaction is a classic base-catalyzed rearrangement of an allylic epoxide.\n\n<<<C>>>"
