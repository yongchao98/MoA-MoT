    "The user is asking to identify the type of interstellar medium in the Milky Way that would produce an absorption line with the same characteristics as one observed from a distant galaxy, but at rest (i.e., within our own galaxy).\n\n1.  **De-redshift the observation:**\n    The light from a source at a distance of 2.1 Gpc is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. We need to calculate the energy of this absorption line in its rest frame (the energy it would have if it were in the Milky Way).\n\n2.  **Calculate the redshift (z):**\n    We can estimate the redshift using Hubble's Law: v = H₀ * d, and for non-relativistic velocities, z ≈ v/c.\n    *   H₀ (Hubble constant) ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc\n    *   d = 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\n    The recession velocity `v` is `70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s`.\n    The redshift `z` is `v / c = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the rest-frame energy (E_rest):**\n    The observed energy (E_obs) is related to the rest-frame energy (E_rest) by the formula: E_obs = E_rest / (1 + z).\n    Therefore, E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z).\n    *   E_obs = 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n    *   z = 0.49\n\n    E_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49) = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * 1.49 = 5.811 * 10⁻⁶ eV.\n\n4.  **Identify the transition corresponding to the rest-frame energy:**\n    Now we need to find what atomic or molecular transition in the interstellar medium has an energy of approximately 5.8 x 10⁻⁶ eV. We can convert this energy to a more familiar unit like frequency (Hz) or wavelength (cm).\n    Let's use the Planck-Einstein relation: E = hf, where h (Planck's constant) ≈ 4.136 * 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s.\n\n    Frequency `f = E_rest / h = (5.811 * 10⁻⁶ eV) / (4.136 * 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s) ≈ 1.405 * 10⁹ Hz`, which is 1405 MHz.\n\n    This frequency is famously close to the **1420 MHz (21 cm) line of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI)**. This is a hyperfine (spin-flip) transition.\n\n5.  **Relate the transition to the interstellar medium:**\n    The 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen is a fundamental tool for studying the atomic component of the interstellar medium (ISM).\n    *   **Emission:** The line is seen in emission from both the warm (WNM, ~8000 K) and cold (CNM, ~80 K) neutral atomic medium.\n    *   **Absorption:** The line is seen in absorption when there is a bright background radio source (like the distant galaxy in the problem) and a cloud of colder neutral hydrogen lies in the line of sight. The cold gas absorbs photons from the background source.\n\n    Since the problem describes an *absorption* line, this specifically traces the **cold atomic interstellar medium**.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculation with more precision.\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Given values\nE_obs_eV = 3.9e-6  # Observed energy in eV\nd_Gpc = 2.1        # Distance in Gpc\n\n# Constants\nH0_kms_Mpc = 70.0  # Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc\nc_kms = const.c / 1000.0  # Speed of light in km/s\nh_eVs = const.h / const.e # Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Convert distance to Mpc\nd_Mpc = d_Gpc * 1000\n\n# Calculate redshift z using Hubble's Law\n# v = H0 * d\n# z = v / c\nz = (H0_kms_Mpc * d_Mpc) / c_kms\n\n# Calculate rest-frame energy\n# E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)\nE_rest_eV = E_obs_eV * (1 + z)\n\n# Calculate rest-frame frequency from the energy\n# E = hf => f = E/h\nf_rest_Hz = E_rest_eV / h_eVs\nf_rest_MHz = f_rest_Hz / 1e6\n\n# Known frequency of the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen (HI)\nf_HI_MHz = 1420.40575\n\nprint(f\"Distance: {d_Gpc} Gpc\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Redshift (z): {z:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Rest-Frame Energy: {E_rest_eV:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Rest-Frame Frequency: {f_rest_MHz:.2f} MHz\")\nprint(f\"Known HI 21-cm line frequency: {f_HI_MHz:.2f} MHz\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated rest-frame frequency is extremely close to the 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen.\")\nprint(\"In the Milky Way, absorption at this line traces the cold component of the atomic interstellar medium.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning process to solve this problem involves several steps of astrophysical calculation and knowledge.\n\n1.  **Identify the nature of the observation**: The problem describes an *absorption line* observed from a very distant object. The distance implies that the light from this object will be significantly redshifted due to the expansion of the universe.\n\n2.  **Calculate the redshift (z)**: We can estimate the redshift using the Hubble-Lemaître Law, which relates the recession velocity (v) of a galaxy to its distance (d): `v = H₀ * d`. The redshift `z` is then given by `z = v / c` for non-relativistic velocities, but for a more accurate relationship, especially at these distances, we consider the definition of redshift directly.\n    *   **Distance (d)**: 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc.\n    *   **Hubble Constant (H₀)**: A standard value is approximately 70 km/s/Mpc.\n    *   **Speed of Light (c)**: Approximately 300,000 km/s.\n    *   **Recession Velocity (v)**: `v = 70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Redshift (z)**: `z = v / c = 147,000 / 300,000 = 0.49`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest)**: The observed energy (`E_obs`) of the absorption line is lower than its energy at the source (`E_rest`) because the wavelength has been stretched (and thus energy decreased) by the cosmic expansion. The relationship is: `E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)`.\n    *   **Observed Energy (E_obs)**: 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV.\n    *   **Redshift (z)**: 0.49.\n    *   **Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest)**: `(3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49) = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * 1.49 ≈ 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV`.\n\n4.  **Identify the corresponding transition**: Now, we need to find what atomic or molecular transition in the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM) corresponds to an energy of about 5.81 x 10⁻⁶ eV. We can convert this to a more common unit, like frequency, using the Planck-Einstein relation `E = hf`, where `h` is Planck's constant (≈ 4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s).\n    *   **Frequency (f)**: `f = E_rest / h = (5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV) / (4.136 * 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s) ≈ 1.405 * 10⁹ Hz`, or **1405 MHz**.\n\n5.  **Relate the transition to the Interstellar Medium (ISM)**: A frequency of ~1405 MHz is extremely close to the famous **1420.4 MHz** spectral line. This line is produced by the hyperfine \"spin-flip\" transition of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I) and has a corresponding wavelength of approximately 21 cm.\n\n6.  **Determine the specific phase of the ISM**: The 21-cm line can be observed in both emission and absorption.\n    *   **Emission** comes from all neutral atomic hydrogen.\n    *   **Absorption**, however, requires a background source of radio waves (in this case, the distant object) and a cloud of *colder* gas in front of it. The atoms in the colder gas are more likely to be in the lower energy state, allowing them to absorb photons from the background source and jump to the higher energy state. Therefore, 21-cm *absorption lines* are a key tracer of the **Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium** (also known as the Cold Neutral Medium, or CNM), which has temperatures around 50-100 Kelvin. The Warm Atomic Medium (~8000 K) is too hot to produce significant absorption features.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The observed line, once corrected for redshift, corresponds to the 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen. An absorption feature at this wavelength specifically indicates the presence of cold atomic gas.\n\n<<<B>>>"
