    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically involving time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (S') is Δt₀ = 50 s. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is moving along with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`. We have the velocity (v), but we need the time as measured in the Galaxy's frame (Δt), not the ejecta's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    *   The relationship between the time measured in the stationary frame (Δt) and the proper time in the moving frame (Δt₀) is given by the time dilation formula:\n        Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    *   Where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (β = v/c):\n        β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        β² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   Now, use the standard distance formula with the velocity (v) and the dilated time (Δt):\n        d = v * Δt\n        d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √0.96) * 50 s )\n        d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km\n        d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50 # seconds\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate gamma\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n```output\n3061862.1784789725\n```\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is closest to option C.\n\nd ≈ 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference and Knowns:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S) and the ejecta's frame (let's call it S').\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that passes in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n    *   The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`.\n    *   The velocity `v` is known (60,000 km/s).\n    *   However, the time must also be measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). We cannot use the 50 seconds directly, as that time was measured in the ejecta's frame (S').\n\n3.  **Apply the Time Dilation Principle:**\n    *   According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time passes more slowly for a moving object as measured by a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The time measured in the stationary frame (S), which we'll call `Δt`, is related to the proper time in the moving frame (S'), `Δt₀`, by the Lorentz factor, γ (gamma).\n    *   The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, often called beta (β):\n        `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, we can calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula from step 3:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    *   Now we can calculate the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy's frame using the dilated time `Δt`.\n    *   `Distance = v * Δt`\n    *   `Distance = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √0.96) * 50 s )`\n    *   `Distance = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km`\n    *   `Distance = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km`\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   Calculating the value: `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   `Distance ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n    *   This value is very close to option C.\n\nThe provided python code executed this calculation precisely, yielding `3061862.1784789725` km. When we compare this result to the given options:\n*   A) 3,000,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,060,000 km\n*   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<C>>>"
