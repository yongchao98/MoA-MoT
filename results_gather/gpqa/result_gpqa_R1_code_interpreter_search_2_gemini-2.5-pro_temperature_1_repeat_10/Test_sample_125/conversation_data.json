    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5, with the (S) configuration. The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH). This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 stereocenter.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The reaction produces two compounds:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one (but not all) of their stereocenters. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4. We need to analyze the possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Analysis of Stereoisomers:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3 atom. Therefore, it is an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (they are superimposable).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers:\n    1.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    (The latter two forming a racemic mixture). The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It uses a polar stationary phase.\n    *   It **can** separate constitutional isomers (different connectivity).\n    *   It **can** separate diastereomers (different physical properties, including polarity).\n    *   It **cannot** separate enantiomers (identical physical properties in an achiral environment).\n*   **Applying to the mixture:** The final mixture contains five different compounds in total.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since they are diastereomers, they have different polarities and will be separated. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers: meso-pentane-2,4-diol, (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two and will be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n        *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) compounds are enantiomers. They will not be separated by a normal-phase (achiral) column and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   So, the products from Reaction II will produce a total of **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Combined Analysis:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas and structures. They will have significantly different retention times and will not overlap.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** HPLC with a chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all stereoisomers.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:** We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column can distinguish between all of these. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. The three stereoisomers from Reaction II (the meso compound and the two enantiomers) will all be separated from each other. The compounds from Reaction I and II will also be separated. Therefore, each of the five unique compounds will produce its own peak.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
