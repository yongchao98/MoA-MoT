    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). The reaction is:\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^- $$\nThis process is a form of pair production. For this reaction to occur, the total energy of the two initial photons in their center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products (one electron and one positron). The question asks for the energy threshold of the high-energy gamma-ray for this process to be possible, which in turn limits its propagation distance (lifetime) in the universe.\n\n### 2. Apply Relativistic Kinematics\n\nWe use the principle of Lorentz invariance of the square of the total four-momentum ($s$). The four-momentum is a vector $p = (E/c, \\vec{p})$, where E is energy and $\\vec{p}$ is momentum. The square of the four-momentum is $p^2 = E^2/c^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2$. For a particle with rest mass $m$, $p^2 = (mc)^2$. For a photon, the rest mass is zero, so $p^2 = 0$.\n\nLet $p_\\gamma$ be the four-momentum of the high-energy gamma-ray and $p_{CMB}$ be the four-momentum of the CMB photon. The total four-momentum before the collision is $p_{tot} = p_\\gamma + p_{CMB}$.\nThe square of the total four-momentum is:\n$$ s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} $$\nSince photons are massless, $p_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$. Thus,\n$$ s = 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} $$\nThe dot product of two four-momenta $p_1 = (E_1/c, \\vec{p}_1)$ and $p_2 = (E_2/c, \\vec{p}_2)$ is $p_1 \\cdot p_2 = E_1E_2/c^2 - \\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2$. In natural units where $c=1$, this is $E_1E_2 - \\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2$.\n$$ s = 2 (E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}) = 2 (E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - |\\vec{p}_\\gamma| |\\vec{p}_{CMB}| \\cos\\theta) $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons. Since $|\\vec{p}| = E$ for photons (in units with c=1), this becomes:\n$$ s = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\n\n### 3. Determine the Threshold Condition\n\nThe energy threshold for the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) will be the lowest when the center-of-mass energy ($\\sqrt{s}$) is maximized for a given $E_\\gamma$. This occurs in a head-on collision, where the photons travel towards each other. In this case, the angle $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (180°), and $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\nSo, the maximum center-of-mass energy for a given $E_\\gamma$ and $E_{CMB}$ is:\n$$ s = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - (-1)) = 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} $$\n\nNow, consider the final state ($e^+e^-$) at the threshold of creation. At the threshold, the electron and positron are created with the minimum possible energy, which means they are created at rest in the center-of-mass frame. The total energy in the CM frame is the sum of their rest mass energies, $m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\nThe total four-momentum in the final state is $p_{final} = (2m_e, \\vec{0})$ in natural units.\nThe square of this is:\n$$ s = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4 (m_e c^2)^2 $$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Threshold Energy\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $s$ at the threshold, we can find the minimum required energy for the gamma-ray, $E_\\gamma$:\n$$ 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = 4 (m_e c^2)^2 $$\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}} $$\nAny gamma-ray with energy greater than this threshold will be able to interact with a CMB photon coming from the opposite direction.\n\n### 5. Plug in the Values and Compute\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$, is a known physical constant. Its value is approximately $0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nNow, we calculate $E_\\gamma$:\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\nThe question provides answers in units of Giga-electron-volts (GeV). We need to convert our result to GeV:\n$1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n$$ E_\\gamma (\\text{GeV}) = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\nThis result is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\n# Electron rest mass energy in eV\nm_e_c2_eV = 0.511e6\n# Average CMB photon energy in eV, from the problem statement\nE_CMB_eV = 1e-3\n\n# Threshold energy formula for the gamma-ray\n# E_gamma = (m_e_c2)^2 / E_CMB\nE_gamma_eV = (m_e_c2_eV**2) / E_CMB_eV\n\n# Convert the result to GeV (1 GeV = 1e9 eV)\nE_gamma_GeV = E_gamma_eV / 1e9\n\nprint(f\"The threshold gamma-ray energy is {E_gamma_GeV:.2e} GeV\")\n```\n> The threshold gamma-ray energy is 2.61e+05 GeV\n\nThe calculation gives $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum energy (threshold energy) a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) must have to produce an electron-positron pair when it collides with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).\n\n### 1. The Physical Process\nThe reaction is pair production from two photons:\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^- $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the high-energy gamma-ray, $\\gamma_{CMB}$ is a CMB photon, $e^+$ is a positron, and $e^-$ is an electron.\n\n### 2. Relativistic Kinematics and the Threshold Condition\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products. The products are an electron and a positron, each with a rest mass $m_e$. Therefore, the minimum energy required in the CM frame is $2 m_e c^2$.\n\nWe can use the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, which is the square of the total four-momentum of the system. Let the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon be $p_\\gamma = (E_\\gamma/c, \\vec{p}_\\gamma)$ and $p_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}/c, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$, respectively.\n\nThe square of the total four-momentum before the collision is:\n$$ s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} $$\nSince photons are massless, their four-momentum squared is zero ($p^2 = 0$). So, $p_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n$$ s = 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} $$\nThe dot product of the four-momenta is $p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = \\frac{E_\\gamma E_{CMB}}{c^2} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$.\nUsing natural units where $c=1$, this becomes $E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For photons, the magnitude of the momentum is equal to the energy ($|\\vec{p}| = E$).\n$$ s = 2(E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - |\\vec{p}_\\gamma| |\\vec{p}_{CMB}| \\cos\\theta) = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the two incoming photons.\n\nTo find the threshold energy for the high-energy photon ($E_\\gamma$), we need to find the condition that requires the least amount of energy. This occurs when the center-of-mass energy is maximized for a given $E_\\gamma$. The term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized when the collision is head-on, meaning the photons are moving towards each other. In this case, $\\theta = \\pi$ (or 180°), and $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\nSo, the maximum value for $s$ for a given $E_\\gamma$ is:\n$$ s_{max} = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - (-1)) = 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} $$\n\nAt the threshold, the total energy in the CM frame is just enough to create the electron-positron pair at rest. The square of the invariant mass of the final system is:\n$$ s = (E_{total, CM})^2 = (m_e c^2 + m_e c^2)^2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2 $$\nBy equating the two expressions for $s$ at the threshold, we get:\n$$ 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2 $$\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}} $$\nThis formula gives the minimum energy $E_\\gamma$ required for the reaction to happen, which is the threshold energy. Gamma-rays with energy above this threshold will have their propagation distance (and thus effective lifetime in the universe) limited by this interaction.\n\n### 3. Calculation\nWe are given:\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron is a known constant, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_\\gamma = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\nThe answers are given in Giga-electron-volts (GeV). We convert our result to GeV, knowing that $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\n# Electron rest mass energy in eV. 1 MeV = 1e6 eV.\nm_e_c2_eV = 0.511e6\n# Average CMB photon energy in eV, from the problem statement\nE_CMB_eV = 1e-3\n\n# Threshold energy formula for the gamma-ray: E_gamma = (m_e_c2)^2 / E_CMB\nE_gamma_eV = (m_e_c2_eV**2) / E_CMB_eV\n\n# Convert the result from eV to GeV (1 GeV = 1e9 eV)\nE_gamma_GeV = E_gamma_eV / 1e9\n\nprint(f\"The threshold gamma-ray energy is {E_gamma_GeV:.2f} x 1e5 GeV\")\n# Reformat the output to match the options\nprint(f\"The threshold gamma-ray energy is {E_gamma_GeV:.1e} GeV\")\n\n```\n> The threshold gamma-ray energy is 2.61 x 1e5 GeV\n> The threshold gamma-ray energy is 2.6e+05 GeV\n\nThe calculated threshold energy is $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV.

    "The problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can annihilate with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$.\n\n### Theoretical Basis\nAccording to special relativity, for a reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products. For the creation of an electron-positron pair, this minimum energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the electron and the positron, which is $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the rest mass of an electron and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe energy threshold for the incident gamma-ray will be the lowest when the interaction is most efficient. This happens in a head-on collision. For a head-on collision between a high-energy photon of energy $E_\\gamma$ and a low-energy photon of energy $E_{CMB}$, the square of the center-of-mass energy ($s$) is given by:\n$s = 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n\nAt the threshold for pair production, this center-of-mass energy must be equal to the rest energy of the electron-positron pair:\n$\\sqrt{s} = 2m_e c^2$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$s = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n### Calculation\nBy equating the two expressions for $s$, we can find the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n$4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$, is a well-known physical constant, approximately $0.511 \\text{ MeV}$ or $0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV).
