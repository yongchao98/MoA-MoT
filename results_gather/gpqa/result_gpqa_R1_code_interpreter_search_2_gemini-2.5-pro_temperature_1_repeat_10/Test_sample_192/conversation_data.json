    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars per unit of parallax, let's denote this as `dN/d(plx)`, varies with parallax (`plx`) as follows:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars per unit of distance, `dN/dr`, changes with distance (`r`). In other words, we need to find the proportionality between `dN/dr` and `r`.\n\n3.  **Establish the Fundamental Relationship:**\n    The parallax of a star is defined as the inverse of its distance.\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This also means that distance is the inverse of parallax:\n    `r = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule of Calculus:**\n    To find the relationship between `dN/dr` and `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to find how parallax changes with respect to distance. We differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r²`\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance (`r`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases, which is expected. For scaling purposes, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship, but we will carry the sign through the calculation for completeness.\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Relationships into the Chain Rule Equation:**\n    Now we substitute the given proportionality for `dN/d(plx)` and the derivative `d(plx)/dr` into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (`r`):**\n    The goal is to find the relationship with `r`, so we need to replace `plx` in the equation with its equivalent in terms of `r`. We use the relationship `plx = 1/r`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    First, simplify the `(1/r)⁻⁵` term:\n    `(1/r)⁻⁵ = (r⁻¹)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n    Now substitute this back into the proportionality:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n9.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    The result `dN/dr ∝ -r³` tells us that the number of stars per unit range of distance scales with the cube of the distance. The negative sign is a consequence of parallax and distance being inversely related, but the scaling power is 3.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes as `r³`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
