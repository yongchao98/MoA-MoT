    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**1. Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination Step)**\n\nThe strong base, the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (d or D).\n\nDue to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. However, both abstraction pathways are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6 (major pathway)**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at C2. This is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2 (minor pathway)**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    3.  In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**2. Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The amide ion attacks the symmetrical benzyne intermediate.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same product.\n    2.  The final product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition reactions, we find that three distinct organic products can be formed:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
