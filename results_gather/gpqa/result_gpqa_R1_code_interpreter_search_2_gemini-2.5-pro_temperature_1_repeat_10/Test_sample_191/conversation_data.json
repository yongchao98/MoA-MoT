    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge of the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge +q:** A point charge of +q is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** Due to the presence of the +q charge inside the cavity, charges within the conductor will redistribute. According to Gauss's law, the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. To achieve this, a net charge of -q must be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This induced charge -q will distribute itself non-uniformly on the cavity's surface to perfectly cancel the electric field produced by the point charge +q for all points outside the cavity (i.e., within the conductor material and beyond).\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of -q has been drawn to the inner surface from the bulk of the conductor, a charge of +q must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality (Total Charge = 0).\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere. The inner charges (+q in the cavity and -q on the cavity wall) are completely shielded by the conducting material. This means that from the perspective of the outer surface, the internal configuration is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is that a net charge of +q now resides on the conductor. For a spherical conductor in equilibrium, this charge +q will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer surface.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the original point charge +q, the induced charge -q on the inner surface, and the induced charge +q on the outer surface.\n    *   **Field from internal charges (+q and -q):** The combination of the point charge +q and the induced charge -q on the cavity surface creates a net field of zero everywhere outside the cavity. This is a fundamental property of electrostatic shielding by a conductor.\n    *   **Field from the outer surface charge (+q):** The electric field at the external point P is therefore solely due to the uniformly distributed charge +q on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n7.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A well-known result from Gauss's law is that the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = +q.\n    *   The center of this sphere is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as L.\n\n8.  **Final Result:** Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its displacement from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ is extraneous detail designed to distract. The shielding effect of the conductor makes these details irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor.\n\n<<<D>>>"
