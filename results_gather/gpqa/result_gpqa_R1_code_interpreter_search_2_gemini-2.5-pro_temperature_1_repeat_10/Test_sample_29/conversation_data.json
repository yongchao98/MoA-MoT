    "*   **Step 1: Understand the relationship between absorbed and emitted light.**\n    When a molecule, like a textile dye, absorbs light, its electrons are promoted to a higher energy state. The molecule then typically loses some energy through non-radiative processes (like vibrations) before emitting light (fluorescence) to return to its ground state. This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift. Consequently, the emitted light always has lower energy (and thus a longer wavelength) than the absorbed light.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.**\n    The energy (E) of a photon is related to its wavelength (λ) by the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. A useful shortcut for converting between energy in electron-volts (eV) and wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n    λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\n    Given the energy of the emitted light is E_emitted = 2.3393 eV.\n    λ_emitted ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\n    λ_emitted ≈ 530 nm\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the color of the emitted light.**\n    The visible light spectrum is approximately:\n    *   Violet: 400-450 nm\n    *   Blue: 450-495 nm\n    *   Green: 495-570 nm\n    *   Yellow: 570-590 nm\n    *   Orange: 590-620 nm\n    *   Red: 620-750 nm\n\n    A wavelength of 530 nm falls squarely in the **green** region of the visible spectrum. So, the dye emits green light.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the color of the absorbed light.**\n    According to the principle of Stokes shift, the absorbed light must have a higher energy and a shorter wavelength than the emitted light.\n    *   Emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) ≈ 530 nm\n    *   Absorbed wavelength (λ_absorbed) < 530 nm\n\n    Now let's examine the options provided:\n    *   A) Red: λ ≈ 620-750 nm. This wavelength is longer than 530 nm (lower energy). Incorrect.\n    *   B) Yellow: λ ≈ 570-590 nm. This wavelength is longer than 530 nm (lower energy). Incorrect.\n    *   C) Violet: λ ≈ 400-450 nm. This wavelength is shorter than 530 nm (higher energy). Possible.\n    *   D) Blue: λ ≈ 450-495 nm. This wavelength is shorter than 530 nm (higher energy). Possible.\n\n*   **Step 5: Choose the most plausible option.**\n    Both blue and violet light have higher energy than the emitted green light. However, the absorption and emission spectra for a dye are often closely related. A very common pattern for fluorescent dyes is absorbing light in one color band and emitting light in the adjacent, longer-wavelength band. For example, the well-known dye fluorescein absorbs blue light (peak at ~494 nm) and emits green light (peak at ~521 nm). This blue-to-green transition is a classic example. Given that the dye emits green light (530 nm), it is most likely that it absorbs light in the adjacent higher-energy band, which is blue (450-495 nm). The energy gap between blue light absorption and green light emission corresponds to a typical Stokes shift for organic dyes.\n\nTherefore, the absorbed light is blue.\n\n<<<D>>>"
