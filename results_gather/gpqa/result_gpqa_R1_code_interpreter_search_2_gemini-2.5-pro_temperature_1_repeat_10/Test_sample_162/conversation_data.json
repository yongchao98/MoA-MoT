    "This problem involves two main parts: calculating the volume of acid required to dissolve the iron(III) hydroxide and then calculating the pH of the resulting solution due to the hydrolysis of the aquated iron(III) ion.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the minimum volume of strong acid needed.**\n\n1.  **Write the chemical reaction:** The dissolution of solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a strong monobasic acid (which provides H⁺ ions) is a neutralization reaction.\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Determine the stoichiometry:** The balanced equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts completely with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g.\n    *   We need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n        *   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n        *   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n        *   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n        *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   Based on the stoichiometry (1:3 ratio), moles of H⁺ = 3 × moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n5.  **Calculate the volume of the acid:**\n    *   The acid is a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid, so [H⁺] = 0.1 mol/L.\n    *   Volume (L) = Moles of H⁺ / Concentration of acid.\n    *   Convert the volume from liters (L) to cubic centimeters (cm³) by multiplying by 1000 (since 1 L = 1000 cm³).\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution.**\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:** After the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, water, and the anion from the strong acid (which is a spectator ion). The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\n2.  **Consider the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:** The Fe³⁺ ion is a small, highly charged metal ion. In water, it exists as the hydrated complex ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺. This complex ion acts as a weak acid, donating a proton to water in a hydrolysis reaction.\n    [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n    For simplicity, this is often written as:\n    Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n3.  **Set up the equilibrium expression:** The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction is:\n    Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n\n4.  **Find the value of Ka:** The acid dissociation constant for the hydrated Fe³⁺ ion needs to be known. A search reveals that a commonly accepted value for Ka is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻³.\n\n5.  **Calculate the initial concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   The moles of Fe³⁺ are equal to the initial moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   [Fe³⁺]initial = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume (0.1 L).\n\n6.  **Use an ICE table to find the equilibrium [H⁺]:**\n    *   Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the system reaches equilibrium. At equilibrium, [H⁺] = x and [Fe(OH)²⁺] = x, while [Fe³⁺] = [Fe³⁺]initial - x.\n    *   Substitute these into the Ka expression: Ka = x² / ([Fe³⁺]initial - x).\n    *   This is a quadratic equation. We solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of H⁺.\n\n7.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Once x = [H⁺] is found, the pH is calculated using the formula: pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]).\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Part 1: Acid Volume Calculation ---\n\n# Given values\nmass_feoh3 = 0.1  # g\nacid_concentration = 0.1  # M (mol/L)\ntotal_volume = 100.0 # cm3 -> 0.1 L\n\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nmolar_mass_Fe = 55.845\nmolar_mass_O = 15.999\nmolar_mass_H = 1.008\n\n# Calculate molar mass of Fe(OH)3\nmolar_mass_feoh3 = molar_mass_Fe + 3 * (molar_mass_O + molar_mass_H)\n\n# Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3\nmoles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / molar_mass_feoh3\n\n# Calculate moles of H+ needed (from stoichiometry Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> ...)\nmoles_h_plus_needed = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\n# Calculate volume of acid in Liters\nvolume_acid_L = moles_h_plus_needed / acid_concentration\n\n# Convert volume to cm3\nvolume_acid_cm3 = volume_acid_L * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3: {molar_mass_feoh3:.4f} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of Fe(OH)3: {moles_feoh3:.6f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of H+ needed: {moles_h_plus_needed:.6f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Minimum volume of acid needed: {volume_acid_cm3:.2f} cm3\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH Calculation ---\n\n# Ka for the hydrolysis of [Fe(H2O)6]3+\nKa = 6.3e-3\n\n# Initial concentration of Fe3+ in the final 100 cm3 (0.1 L) solution\ninitial_conc_fe3 = moles_feoh3 / (total_volume / 1000)\n\nprint(f\"Initial [Fe3+]: {initial_conc_fe3:.6f} M\")\n\n# We need to solve the quadratic equation: x^2 + Ka*x - Ka*C_initial = 0\n# where x = [H+] and C_initial = initial_conc_fe3\n# a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0\na = 1\nb = Ka\nc = -Ka * initial_conc_fe3\n\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n# We take the positive root for concentration\nh_plus_conc = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)\n\n# Calculate pH\nph_solution = -math.log10(h_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"[H+] at equilibrium: {h_plus_conc:.6f} M\")\nprint(f\"pH of the resulting solution: {ph_solution:.2f}\")\n```\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)3: 106.8660 g/mol\nMoles of Fe(OH)3: 0.000936 mol\nMoles of H+ needed: 0.002807 mol\nMinimum volume of acid needed: 28.07 cm3\n--------------------\nInitial [Fe3+]: 0.009357 M\n[H+] at equilibrium: 0.005089 M\npH of the resulting solution: 2.29\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculations show:\n*   The minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required is **28.07 cm³**.\n*   The pH of the final 100 cm³ solution is **2.29**.\n\nComparing these calculated values to the given options:\n\nA) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nB) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nC) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\nD) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the volume in option C (28.05 cm³). The slight difference is likely due to rounding of molar masses during the problem's creation.\n\nThe calculated pH (2.29) is reasonably close to the pH in option C (2.04). The discrepancy might arise from using a slightly different Ka value for the Fe³⁺ hydrolysis. If we were to use a higher Ka value, the pH would be lower. For example, some sources cite Ka as high as 10⁻²³, which would yield a pH closer to 2. However, given the options, pH 2.29 is much closer to 2.04 than to any other pH value listed. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Calculation of the minimum volume of acid\n\n1.  **Write the balanced chemical equation:** The reaction between iron(III) hydroxide, a base, and a strong monobasic acid (represented by H⁺) is a neutralization reaction.\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Determine the stoichiometry:** From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n        *   Molar mass of Iron (Fe) ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n        *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n        *   Molar mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n        *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (16.00 + 1.008) = 106.869 g/mol.\n    *   Now, calculate the moles of the given mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n        *   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n        *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   Using the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio from the balanced equation:\n        *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n5.  **Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid:**\n    *   The acid has a concentration of 0.1 M, which means 0.1 mol/L.\n    *   Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n    *   To convert the volume to cubic centimeters (cm³), we multiply by 1000 (since 1 L = 1000 cm³).\n        *   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is very close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option C.
