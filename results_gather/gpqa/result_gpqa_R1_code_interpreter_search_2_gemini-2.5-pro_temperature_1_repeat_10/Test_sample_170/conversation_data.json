    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nThe position of electrophilic substitution on a substituted benzene ring is determined by the nature of the substituent already present. We need to classify each substituent as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing. We also need to consider their effect on the reaction rate (activating or deactivating), as this is related to their directing effect.\n\n*   **Substance 1: Toluene (C6H5-CH3)**\n    *   The methyl group (-CH3) is an alkyl group. It is electron-donating through induction and hyperconjugation.\n    *   Classification: **Activating, ortho,para-directing.**\n*   **Substance 2: Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)**\n    *   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is electron-withdrawing due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atoms and resonance.\n    *   Classification: **Deactivating, meta-directing.**\n*   **Substance 3: Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)**\n    *   The chloro group (-Cl) is a halogen. It is electron-withdrawing by induction but electron-donating by resonance. The inductive effect is stronger, making it deactivating overall. However, the resonance effect directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   Classification: **Deactivating, ortho,para-directing.**\n*   **Substance 4: Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)**\n    *   The nitro group (-NO2) is strongly electron-withdrawing through both induction and resonance.\n    *   Classification: **Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.**\n*   **Substance 5: Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)**\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an alkyl group, similar to methyl. It is electron-donating.\n    *   Classification: **Activating, ortho,para-directing.**\n*   **Substance 6: Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)**\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   Classification: **Deactivating, meta-directing.**\n\n**Step 2: Group the substances by directing effect.**\nThe question asks for the yield of the *para*-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directing substances** will produce very little para-isomer, with the meta-isomer being the major product. This group includes:\n    *   4 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6 (Benzoic acid)\n*   **Ortho,para-directing substances** will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   1 (Toluene)\n    *   5 (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3 (Chlorobenzene)\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will have the meta-directing substances first, followed by the ortho,para-directing substances.\nOrder: {4, 2, 6} < {1, 5, 3}\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within the meta-directing group.**\nFor meta-directors, a stronger deactivating effect leads to a higher selectivity for the meta position, and consequently, a lower yield of the para (and ortho) isomers. The order of deactivating strength for these groups is generally:\n-NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOC2H5\n\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4)**: The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator in the list. It will be the most strongly meta-directing and will produce the least amount of para-isomer (typically <1%). So, 4 will be the first in the sequence.\n*   **Benzoic acid (6) vs. Ethyl benzoate (2)**: Both -COOH and -COOC2H5 are deactivating. Their strengths are very similar. The standard textbook order places -COOH as slightly more deactivating than -COOC2H5. This would mean benzoic acid is more strongly meta-directing, giving less para-product than ethyl benzoate (para yield: 6 < 2). However, under Lewis acid catalysis (like FeBr3 for bromination), the catalyst can coordinate with the carbonyl oxygen. The ester's carbonyl oxygen is slightly more basic (due to the electron-donating ethyl group) and may coordinate more strongly, making the entire complex a stronger deactivator. If this is the case, the ester would give less para-product (para yield: 2 < 6). Let's examine the options to resolve this ambiguity later, but we know 4 is the lowest.\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within the ortho,para-directing group.**\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer is primarily determined by **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position.\n\nLet's compare the steric bulk of the substituents: -Cl, -CH3, and -C2H5.\n*   A chlorine atom (-Cl) is a single atom.\n*   A methyl group (-CH3) is larger than a chlorine atom.\n*   An ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than a methyl group.\n\nSo, the order of increasing steric bulk is: **-Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5**.\n\nThis means the preference for para-substitution will increase in the same order.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3)** will have the lowest para yield among this group.\n*   **Toluene (1)** will have a higher para yield.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5)** will have the highest para yield.\n\nThe order of increasing para yield for this group is: **3 < 1 < 5**.\nTypical approximate para yields for bromination confirm this: Chlorobenzene (~65-70%), Toluene (~67%), Ethylbenzene (~94%).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the groups and select the correct option.**\nWe have established:\n*   The overall order is {m-directors} < {o,p-directors}.\n*   The m-director with the lowest para yield is 4 (-NO2).\n*   The o,p-director order is 3 < 1 < 5.\n\nSo the final sequence must start with the remaining m-directors {2, 6} after 4, and end with ...3 < 1 < 5.\n\nLet's look at the options provided:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nOnly option **B** has the correct ordering for the ortho,para-directors (...3 < 1 < 5). Let's check if its ordering of the meta-directors (4 < 2 < 6) is plausible. This implies that the para-isomer yield increases in the order Nitrobenzene < Ethyl benzoate < Benzoic acid. As discussed in Step 3, this ordering is plausible under the specific reaction conditions.\n\nTherefore, combining all the pieces, the most logical sequence among the choices is 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5.\n\nFinal sequence check:\n*   **4 (C6H5-NO2):** Lowest para yield (<1%).\n*   **2 (C6H5-COOC2H5):** Very low para yield.\n*   **6 (C6H5-COOH):** Very low para yield, slightly more than 2.\n*   **3 (C6H5-Cl):** High para yield (~65-70%).\n*   **1 (C6H5-CH3):** Higher para yield (~67%).\n*   **5 (C6H5-C2H5):** Highest para yield (~94%).\n\nThe order is consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>"
