    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the enolate precursor.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The combination of a ketone, a base, and an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound indicates a **Michael Addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   We need to identify the available α-protons. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1 (carbonyl), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, C1 (carbonyl), and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can **only** occur at the C6 position. The enolate will form with a double bond between C1 and C6. This is a regioselective reaction.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The intermediate is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated during workup (implicitly with H₂O or a mild acid) to give the final product.\n    *   The initial ketone structure: C=O at C1, Et and Me at C2, Me at C6.\n    *   The product structure: C=O at C1, Et and Me at C2. C6 is now bonded to the original methyl group **and** the new chain, which is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt. C6 becomes a quaternary carbon.\n\n4.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's analyze the names given in the options. The options name the compound as a substituted ethyl propanoate, treating the ketone ring as a substituent. This is a valid, though sometimes less common, IUPAC naming convention.\n    *   Let's analyze the name from option A: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n        *   Parent chain: `ethyl ...propanoate`. The chain is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n        *   At position 3 of the propanoate chain, there is a cyclohexyl substituent. This matches our structure where the ring is attached to the end of the `CH₂CH₂COOEt` chain.\n        *   Let's analyze the cyclohexyl substituent's name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`. The numbering of the substituent ring starts from the point of attachment (let's call it C1').\n        *   **C1'**: Has a methyl group attached (`1-methyl`). This corresponds to the original C6 of our ketone, which had a methyl group. Correct.\n        *   **C2'**: Has an oxo group (`2-oxo`). The carbonyl group is adjacent to the point of attachment. In our structure, the C=O (C1) is adjacent to C6. Correct.\n        *   **C3'**: Has an ethyl and a methyl group (`3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`). This position is adjacent to the carbonyl (C2'). In our structure, C2 is adjacent to the carbonyl (C1) and has an ethyl and a methyl group. Correct.\n    *   The structure derived from the name in option A perfectly matches the product we deduced from the reaction mechanism. The name in option B (`...4-oxocyclohexyl`) has the wrong connectivity.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   This is another **Michael Addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   KOH removes a proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): CH₃CH₂-⁻CH-NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The carbanion (nucleophile) attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   Acceptor: CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 (the β-carbon) of the butenenitrile.\n    *   Product after protonation by water:\n        CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n\n4.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   We need to find the principal functional group and the longest carbon chain containing it. The nitrile (-CN) group has priority.\n    *   The carbon of the CN group is C1.\n    *   The longest chain is a 6-carbon chain: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and B. The name in options C and D (`2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`) corresponds to a molecule with the wrong number of carbon atoms and incorrect connectivity.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is correctly identified as **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is correctly identified as **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these findings with the given choices, only option A contains both correct products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
