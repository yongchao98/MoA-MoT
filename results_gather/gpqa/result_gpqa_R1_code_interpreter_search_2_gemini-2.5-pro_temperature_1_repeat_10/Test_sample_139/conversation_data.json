    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting Point of B.** The substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n        *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C.\n        *   This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water, D₂O**. This also aligns with the initial clue that Substance X involves a \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\"\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Gas W.** Gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\" Let's examine some common gases:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n        *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely given the D₂O context).\n        *   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely).\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This is a perfect fit, especially since we've already identified D₂O.\n        *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction.** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W [D₂] and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B [D₂O].\"\n        *   The release of D₂ gas suggests that X is a deuteride-donating agent (a source of D⁻).\n        *   The fact that it reacts with a liquid Y to produce D₂ and a substance that yields D₂O upon heating suggests Y is D₂O. A deuteride reagent would react with D₂O.\n        *   Let's test this hypothesis: X (a deuteride) + Y (D₂O) → G (precipitate) + W (D₂).\n        *   Heating G → B (D₂O). This is a classic decomposition reaction, likely of a metal deuteroxide: e.g., M(OD)ₙ → Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Organic Chemistry Reaction and Identity of X.** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" And \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n        *   A keto acid (general formula R-C(=O)-COOH) contains a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group, for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   A reaction that reduces the oxygen count from 3 to 2 implies a reduction reaction.\n        *   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its isotopically labeled version, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of \"incorporating a heavier isotope\". LiAlH₄ is the \"very close analog\".\n        *   Let's check the reaction: LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce *both* the ketone and the carboxylic acid.\n            *   Ketone reduction: >C=O → >CH(OH) (or >CD(OH) with LiAlD₄)\n            *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CH₂(OH) (or -CD₂(OH) with LiAlD₄)\n        *   So, R-C(=O)-COOH is reduced by LiAlD₄ to R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH). This final product is a diol, which contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This confirms our hypothesis.\n        *   Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n    *   **Confirming the Full Reaction Sequence:**\n        *   Substance X = LiAlD₄\n        *   Liquid Y = D₂O\n        *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas)\n        *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n        *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide).\n        *   Gas W = D₂.\n        *   Heating G: 2Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3D₂O(g). This releases B = D₂O.\n        *   All clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are:\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic Number = 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic Number = 13\n        *   Hydrogen (H), Atomic Number = 1 (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al).\n    *   Now, we sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**.\n        *   The stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**.\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains:\n        *   Four atoms of the lightest element (as Deuterium). Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   One atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum). Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative atomic mass** = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    The calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
