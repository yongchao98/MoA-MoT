    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. The name provides the absolute stereochemistry of all chiral centers.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It serves as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate. This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nThe problem statement provides a key rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide is across C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n*   C6 is substituted only with a hydrogen atom (and is part of the cyclohexane ring).\n*   Comparing C1 and C6, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophile (Me⁻) will attack C6.\n\n### 3. Determine the Stereoselectivity (Stereochemical Outcome)\nThe problem statement provides another key rule: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   This is a characteristic of an SN2 reaction mechanism. The nucleophile attacks from the backside of the carbon-oxygen bond that is breaking.\n*   The attack occurs at C6. The starting configuration of C6 is given in the name as **(S)**.\n*   Due to the inversion of configuration, the stereocenter at C6 will become **(R)** in the product.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-making steps. In the context of solving this type of problem, we assume their stereochemical descriptors (R/S) are retained.\n    *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C3 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n\n### 4. Determine the Product Structure and IUPAC Name\n*   The reaction opens the epoxide ring. The nucleophile (Me) is added to C6, and the epoxide oxygen remains attached to C1. After an aqueous workup step (which is implicit), this oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The resulting product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (the principal functional group) is assigned locant C1. This corresponds to the C1 of the starting material.\n*   The numbering of the ring should then proceed in a direction that gives the lowest possible locants to the other substituents (the methyl groups).\n    *   Original methyl groups were at C1, C3, C4.\n    *   A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   The hydroxyl group is at C1.\n    *   Let's map the old numbering to the new IUPAC numbering of the product:\n        *   Old C1 → New C1 (bears -OH and -Me)\n        *   Old C6 → New C2 (bears new -Me)\n        *   Old C5 → New C3\n        *   Old C4 → New C4 (bears -Me)\n        *   Old C3 → New C5 (bears -Me)\n        *   Old C2 → New C6\n    *   The substituents are at positions 1 (Me), 2 (Me), 4 (Me), and 5 (Me). The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n### 5. Assemble the Final Product Name\nCombining the structure and the stereochemistry:\n*   The product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The configuration at New C1 (Old C1) is **R**.\n*   The configuration at New C2 (Old C6) is **R** (inverted from S).\n*   The configuration at New C4 (Old C4) is **R**.\n*   The configuration at New C5 (Old C3) is **R**.\n\nSo, the full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThis name matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
