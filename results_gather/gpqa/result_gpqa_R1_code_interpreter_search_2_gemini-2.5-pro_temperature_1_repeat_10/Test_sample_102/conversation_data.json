    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to one another (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n\nThe goal is to introduce these three groups in an order that leverages their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern with high yield.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i:** Benzene → Bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Step ii:** Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product) and o-bromonitrobenzene. The nitro group is placed *para* to the bromo group. This creates a 1,4-substitution pattern, which is incorrect for our target 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence will not lead to the desired product.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   **Step i:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction).\n*   **Step iii:** Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization).\n*   **Step iv:** Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination).\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence of reactions is a futile loop that returns to the starting material, benzene. It cannot produce the target molecule.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   **Step iii:** Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group (-NH2), converting it into a strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing group (-NH2-AlCl3). Acylation would occur *meta* to this group, yielding m-aminoacetophenone.\n*   **Step iv:** m-Aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3. Similarly, FeBr3 will complex with the amino group, making it a *meta*-director. The acetyl group is also a *meta*-director. Both groups are at positions 1 and 3, and both would direct the incoming bromine to position 5, yielding 1-(3-amino-5-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Steps v-vii:** The sequence continues with nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and deamination (H3PO2). This would ultimately remove the amino group introduced earlier, leading to 3-bromoacetophenone, which is not the final target.\n*   **Conclusion:** This entire sequence does not produce the desired final product.\n\n**Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **Step i:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → **Acetophenone**. This is Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n*   **Step ii:** Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). We now have the correct 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n*   **Step iii:** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Now we nitrate the ring. We have two substituents:\n    *   -COCH3 at C1 (*meta*-director, directs to C5).\n    *   -Br at C3 (*ortho, para*-director, directs to C2, C4, C6).\n    Although the directing effects are conflicting, the position C5 is the major site of substitution. The positions ortho and para to the bromine (C2, C4, C6) are either sterically hindered or strongly deactivated by the adjacent powerful electron-withdrawing acetyl group. Therefore, the meta-directing influence of the acetyl group prevails, leading to the formation of the desired 1,3,5-substituted product.\n*   **Steps iv-vii:** The sequence continues with reduction (Fe/HCl), nitration, diazotization, and deamination. These subsequent steps would modify and ultimately degrade the target molecule formed in step iii. However, the first three steps represent a valid, albeit potentially imperfect in yield, synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, Option B is the only one that contains a chemically sound reaction pathway (steps i-iii) that directly produces the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The other options either follow incorrect regiochemical paths, are chemically non-viable, or represent futile cycles. The additional steps (iv-vii) in option B appear to be nonsensical or part of a flawed question, but the initial sequence is correct. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
