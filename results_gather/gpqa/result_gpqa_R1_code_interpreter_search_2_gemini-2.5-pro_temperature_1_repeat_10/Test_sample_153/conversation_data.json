    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. Its relative intensity is 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a characteristic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom. The two major isotopes of chlorine are ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance), which gives this 3:1 ratio.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weight for the proposed general formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (which fits all the options) using the most abundant isotopes:\n*   Carbon: 7 * 12 = 84\n*   Hydrogen: 5 * 1 = 5\n*   Chlorine: 1 * 35 = 35\n*   Oxygen: 2 * 16 = 32\n*   Total MW = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is characteristic of the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The signal is a singlet (s) because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with, and its integration of 1H confirms it represents a single proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The presence of only two signals in the aromatic region, both of which are doublets (d) and each integrating to two protons (2H), strongly suggests a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   In a para-substituted ring, the two protons adjacent (ortho) to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. This symmetry leads to the observed pattern of two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound has a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesizing all the evidence:**\n\n*   **MS:** Confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **IR:** Identifies a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Confirms the carboxylic acid and establishes a *para* substitution pattern on a benzene ring.\n\nCombining these findings, the only possible structure is a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group located in *para* positions (at carbons 1 and 4). This compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) Phenyl chloroformate: Incorrect. Lacks the carboxylic acid group.\n*   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Incorrect. It is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the substitution pattern is wrong.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: MW 156 with one Cl, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-substituted ring.\n*   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Incorrect. The *ortho* substitution would result in four distinct signals in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR, not two doublets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
