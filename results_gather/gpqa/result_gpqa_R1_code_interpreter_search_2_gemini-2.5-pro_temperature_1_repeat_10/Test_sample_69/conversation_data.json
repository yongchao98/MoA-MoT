    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n**1. Analyze the Clues and Identify Key Compounds**\n\n*   **Clue 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.**\n    This is the most revealing clue. A substance (C) hydrolyzes to regenerate its core (A) and produce two acids, one strong and one weak. This strongly suggests that the ligands attached to A in compound C are derived from a single gas (B) whose reaction with water yields a strong and a weak acid. The classic textbook example of this is the disproportionation of nitrogen dioxide (or dinitrogen tetroxide) in water:\n    2NO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → HNO₃(aq) + HNO₂(aq)\n    Nitric acid (HNO₃) is a strong acid, and nitrous acid (HNO₂) is a weak acid.\n    Therefore, we can confidently identify:\n    *   **B = NO₂** (Nitrogen dioxide gas)\n    *   **F = HNO₃** (Nitric acid)\n    *   **G = HNO₂** (Nitrous acid)\n\n*   **Clue 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.**\n    We know B is NO₂. The reaction is D(g) + NO₂(g) → H (solvent).\n    A well-known 1:1 reaction between two simple nitrogen oxides is:\n    NO(g) + NO₂(g) ⇌ N₂O₃\n    Dinitrogen trioxide (N₂O₃) is a deep blue liquid (b.p. 3 °C) and is used as a non-aqueous solvent, particularly for nitrosation reactions.\n    This allows us to identify:\n    *   **D = NO** (Nitric oxide gas)\n    *   **H = N₂O₃** (Dinitrogen trioxide)\n\n**2. Identify the Remaining Compounds (A and C)**\n\n*   **Clue 1: reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.**\n    We have A(s) + 8NO₂(g) → C(red).\n    From Clue 3, we know that C is a complex or adduct of A and NO₂ groups, which we can represent as A·8NO₂. The hydrolysis of C regenerates A, meaning A is the central component.\n    We need to find a solid element A that could plausibly form an adduct with 8 molecules of NO₂. White phosphorus, which exists as tetrahedral P₄ molecules, is a common solid reactant in such puzzles. Let's assume **A = P₄**.\n    Then **C = P₄·8NO₂**, a hypothetical bright red adduct. This is consistent with all information about A and C.\n\n**3. Identify the Hazardous Product E**\n\n*   **Clue 2: When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.**\n    We have all the reactants identified:\n    C = P₄·8NO₂\n    D = NO\n    The reaction is: P₄·8NO₂ + 2NO → E (extremely hazardous product)\n    This reaction seems complex. However, we can reason about the product E. The adduct C is likely held together by relatively weak forces. The reactant D (NO) could trigger the decomposition of C. A plausible reaction is that the NO molecules react with the central P₄ core, causing the release of the NO₂ ligands.\n    P₄·8NO₂(C) + 2NO(D) → [P₄(NO)₂] (byproduct) + 8NO₂(E)\n    In this scenario, the product E is nitrogen dioxide (NO₂).\n    *   Is NO₂ a gas? Yes.\n    *   Is NO₂ \"extremely hazardous\"? Yes, it is a highly toxic gas and a major air pollutant that can cause severe respiratory damage.\n    *   This interpretation creates a consistent picture where all clues are satisfied.\n\n**4. Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\n*   The final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E, which we have identified as **NO₂**.\n*   Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a V-shaped (bent) molecule with the nitrogen atom at the center.\n*   Let's analyze its symmetry elements:\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    2.  **C₂ axis:** There is a two-fold rotational axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and bisects the angle between the two oxygen atoms.\n    3.  **Mirror Planes (σ):**\n        *   There is a vertical mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all three atoms.\n        *   There is a second vertical mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the first plane and contains the C₂ axis.\n*   A molecule that possesses a C₂ axis and two perpendicular vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n```python\n# This is a conceptual chemistry problem. Code is not required to determine the point group of a molecule.\n# The identity of E is deduced to be NO2.\n# The shape of NO2 is bent.\n# A bent AX2 molecule like H2O, SO2, or NO2 has the following symmetry elements:\n# 1. A C2 axis passing through the central atom (N).\n# 2. A mirror plane containing the molecule.\n# 3. A mirror plane perpendicular to the molecular plane, containing the C2 axis.\n# The point group with these elements is C2v.\n# The options are A) C2, B) D∞h, C) C2v, D) D4h.\n# The correct option is C.\n\nprint(\"The molecular symmetry group of NO2 is C2v.\")\n```\n\nFinal Answer is based on the reasoning above. The molecule E is identified as NO₂, which has C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires deducing the identities of several chemical compounds based on a series of reaction clues and then determining the molecular geometry and symmetry of the final product, E.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3:** \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n    *   This hydrolysis reaction is the most informative clue. A single substance (related to C) reacting with water to produce both a strong and a weak acid is characteristic of the disproportionation of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂).\n    *   The reaction is: 2NO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → HNO₃(aq) + HNO₂(aq).\n    *   Nitric acid (HNO₃) is a strong acid, and nitrous acid (HNO₂) is a weak acid.\n    *   This allows us to identify:\n        *   **F = HNO₃** (strong acid)\n        *   **G = HNO₂** (weak acid)\n    *   Since the hydrolysis of C produces these acids, C must contain the chemical components of NO₂. The clue states that gas **B** is the reactant that forms C. Therefore, gas **B = NO₂**.\n    *   The reaction also reforms A, indicating A is the central part of compound C.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    *   We know **B = NO₂**. The reaction is D(g) + NO₂(g) → H.\n    *   A common reaction between two simple nitrogen oxides is NO + NO₂ ⇌ N₂O₃.\n    *   Dinitrogen trioxide (N₂O₃) is a blue liquid that can be used as a special-purpose solvent. This fits the description.\n    *   Therefore, we can identify:\n        *   **D = NO** (nitric oxide)\n        *   **H = N₂O₃** (dinitrogen trioxide)\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1:** \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n    *   We have A(s) + 8B(g) → C(bright red).\n    *   Substituting B = NO₂, we get A(s) + 8NO₂(g) → C.\n    *   We need to identify a solid A that could form an adduct with 8 molecules of NO₂. A common solid starting material in such puzzles is white phosphorus, which exists as tetrahedral P₄ molecules. Let's assume **A = P₄**.\n    *   This would make **C = P₄(NO₂)₈**, an adduct of phosphorus and nitrogen dioxide.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2:** \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   The reaction is C + 2D → E.\n    *   Substituting the identified species: P₄(NO₂)₈ + 2NO → E.\n    *   Given that C is an adduct, it's plausible that the new reactant (D = NO) causes the adduct to decompose, releasing its components. The most likely scenario is that the hazardous product E is the gas that was used to form the adduct in the first place.\n    *   A possible reaction is P₄(NO₂)₈ + 2NO → [a phosphorus-nitrosyl compound] + 8NO₂.\n    *   This identifies the \"extremely hazardous product\" **E = NO₂**. Nitrogen dioxide is a well-known toxic gas and a major air pollutant, fitting the description perfectly.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E.**\n    *   We have identified **E = NO₂**.\n    *   Nitrogen dioxide is a non-linear, bent molecule (V-shaped) with the nitrogen atom at the apex.\n    *   Let's identify its symmetry elements to determine its point group:\n        1.  **Identity (E):** Present in all molecules.\n        2.  **Principal Axis (C₂):** There is a two-fold rotational axis that passes through the N atom and bisects the O-N-O angle.\n        3.  **Mirror Planes (σᵥ):** There are two vertical mirror planes. One plane contains all three atoms (the molecular plane). The other is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis.\n    *   A molecule with the symmetry elements E, C₂, and two σᵥ planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) C₂: Incorrect. Lacks the mirror planes.\nB) D∞h: Incorrect. This is for linear molecules with a center of symmetry (e.g., CO₂, H₂).\nC) C₂ᵥ: Correct. This matches the symmetry of the bent NO₂ molecule.\nD) D₄h: Incorrect. This is for square planar molecules.\n\n<<<C>>>"
