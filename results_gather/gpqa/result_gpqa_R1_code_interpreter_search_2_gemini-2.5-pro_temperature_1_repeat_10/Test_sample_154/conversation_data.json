    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the standard deviation:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A^2 | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 4a: Check if the state is normalized.**\n        The bra vector corresponding to $|\\psi\\rangle$ is $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        The inner product $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle$ should be 1.\n        $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = (-1/2)^*(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})^*(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1/2)^*(-1/2)$\n        $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1$.\n        The state vector is indeed normalized.\n\n    *   **Step 4b: Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.**\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$\n        First, we calculate the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        Now, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$.\n\n    *   **Step 4c: Calculate the operator $P_z^2$.**\n        $P_z^2 = P_z \\times P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $P_z^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    *   **Step 4d: Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.**\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$\n        First, we calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        Now, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$.\n\n    *   **Step 4e: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.**\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n5.  **Final Check:** The information about $P_x$ and $P_y$ and the fact that the state is an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ is consistent with the provided state vector but not directly needed for the calculation once the state vector is given. The calculation steps are standard and the arithmetic is straightforward. The result $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$ matches option C. I will use a Python script to verify the matrix calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Let hbar = 1 for simplicity in calculation, and re-introduce it at the end.\nhbar = 1.0\n\n# Define the state vector |psi>\npsi = np.array([[-1/2], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-1/2]])\n\n# Define the Pz operator matrix\nPz_matrix = hbar * np.array([[1, 0, 0],\n                             [0, 0, 0],\n                             [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz, <Pz>\n# <Pz> = <psi|Pz|psi> = psi_dagger * Pz_matrix * psi\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\nexp_Pz = np.dot(psi_dagger, np.dot(Pz_matrix, psi))\n# print(f\"Expectation value of Pz is: {exp_Pz[0, 0]}\")\n\n# Calculate the Pz^2 operator matrix\nPz2_matrix = np.dot(Pz_matrix, Pz_matrix)\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz^2, <Pz^2>\n# <Pz^2> = <psi|Pz^2|psi> = psi_dagger * Pz2_matrix * psi\nexp_Pz2 = np.dot(psi_dagger, np.dot(Pz2_matrix, psi))\n# print(f\"Expectation value of Pz^2 is: {exp_Pz2[0, 0]}\")\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty Delta_Pz\n# (Delta_Pz)^2 = <Pz^2> - <Pz>^2\nuncertainty_sq = exp_Pz2 - exp_Pz**2\nuncertainty = np.sqrt(uncertainty_sq)\n\n# The final result is the numerical value multiplied by hbar.\n# Since we set hbar=1, the numerical output is the coefficient of hbar.\nprint(f\"The uncertainty Delta_Pz is {uncertainty[0, 0]} * hbar\")\nprint(f\"This is hbar/sqrt(2), which is approximately {1/np.sqrt(2)}\")\n```\n\nThe Python code confirms the manual calculation. The expectation value of $P_z$ is 0. The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $0.5 \\hbar^2 = \\hbar^2/2$. The uncertainty is $\\sqrt{0.5}\\hbar = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\hbar = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
