    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its Hamiltonian:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the potential has the same form in all directions, i.e., the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along the x, y, and z axes.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates. The Hamiltonian is:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z = \\left(\\frac{p_x^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x^2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{p_y^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 y^2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{p_z^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 z^2\\right)$\n    Each term is a one-dimensional (1D) simple harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    We need to find the energy for the third excited state. Let's list the first few energy levels:\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same total energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\n    We can list them out:\n    *   Combinations with a 3: (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) -> 3 states.\n    *   Combinations with a 2 and a 1: (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) -> 6 states.\n    *   Combinations with all 1s: (1, 1, 1) -> 1 state.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level of a d-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, which is given by the binomial coefficient:\n    $g_n = \\binom{n+d-1}{d-1}$\n    For our case, $n=3$ and the dimension $d=3$.\n    $g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n    This confirms that there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   Energy: $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   Number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy): 10\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 -> Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\n    B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 -> Incorrect energy.\n    C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10 -> Correct energy and degeneracy.\n    D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 -> Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
