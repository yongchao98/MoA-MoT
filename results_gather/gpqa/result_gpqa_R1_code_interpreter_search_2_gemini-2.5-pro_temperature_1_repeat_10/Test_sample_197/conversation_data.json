    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **List the Knowns:**\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M\n    *   Equilibrium thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Overall stability constants:\n        *   β₁ = 9 for [Co(SCN)]⁺\n        *   β₂ = 40 for [Co(SCN)₂]\n        *   β₃ = 63 for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n        *   β₄ = 16 for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n3.  **Define the Species and Total Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n4.  **Use the Stability Constants:** The overall stability constants (βₙ) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion ([Co²⁺]) and the free ligand ([SCN⁻]):\n    *   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n    *   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n    *   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n    *   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n5.  **Express Total Concentration in Terms of [Co²⁺]:** Substitute the expressions from step 4 into the equation from step 3:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n    Factor out the [Co²⁺] term:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n6.  **Define the Distribution Coefficient (α₂):** The fraction (or distribution coefficient) of a specific complex, in this case [Co(SCN)₂], is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration. Let's call this α₂.\n    α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\n7.  **Derive the Formula for α₂:** Substitute the expressions for [Co(SCN)₂] and c(Co) into the equation for α₂:\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, simplifying the expression. Notice that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is not needed for this calculation.\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Terms:** Now, plug the given numerical values into the formula.\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    **Numerator:**\n    *   β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n    **Denominator:**\n    *   Term 0 (for [Co²⁺]): 1\n    *   Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁ * [SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]): β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻): β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻): β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    **Sum of Denominator:**\n    Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n9.  **Calculate the Fraction α₂:**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n10. **Convert to Percentage:** To find the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\n    Percentage = α₂ * 100 ≈ 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%\n\nThis result is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
