    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is highly characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. An alcohol O-H is also in this region but is typically less broad.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, provides very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The observation of these peaks in the NMR spectrum confirms the presence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data (peak at 1650 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment:\n        *   Mass = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + (2 * 16) + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The observation of a peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. This strongly corroborates the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Spectroscopic Evidence:**\n    *   The combined data from FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry all point to the same conclusion: the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) and an **alkene** group (C=C).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   A molecule's structure must account for all the functional groups identified.\n    *   The carboxylic acid's C=O bond represents one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The alkene's C=C bond represents a second degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total Degree of Unsaturation of at least 2.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Contains 2 oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        *   A DoU of 1 is insufficient to account for both a C=O and a C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **B) C6H12O:**\n        *   Contains only 1 oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Contains 2 oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        *   A DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This option is consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n    *   **D) C6H10O:**\n        *   Contains only 1 oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the requirements—having two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and a degree of unsaturation of 2 for the C=O and C=C bonds—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
