As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Single-Mutant Phenotypes\nFirst, let's understand the role of each gene individually by looking at the knock-out mutants. The wild-type (WT) plant is our control with 100% resistance.\n\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function causes a partial loss of resistance (25% loss). This indicates that G1 contributes to resistance, but it's not the most critical gene of the three.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function leads to a complete loss of resistance. This is a severe phenotype, suggesting that G2 plays an essential or central role in the resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function causes a substantial loss of resistance (50% loss), which is more severe than the g1 mutant. This means G3 is also a key contributor to resistance.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Double-Mutant Phenotypes to Understand Gene Interactions\nDouble mutants are crucial for determining genetic relationships like epistasis (where one gene's mutation masks the effect of another) and synergy/redundancy.\n\n*   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the g2 single mutant (0% resistance). The mutation in g1 has no additional effect when G2 is also mutated. This is the classic definition of epistasis. **G2 is epistatic to G1** because the g2 mutation masks the g1 mutation's effect. In a genetic pathway, this often means G2 acts downstream of G1, or G2 is part of a parallel pathway that is absolutely essential for the final outcome.\n\n*   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. Similar to the above, this phenotype is identical to the g2 single mutant. The g3 mutation's effect is completely masked by the g2 mutation. Therefore, **G2 is also epistatic to G3**.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance. This result is the most informative about the relationship between G1 and G3.\n    *   The g1 mutant has 75% resistance.\n    *   The g3 mutant has 50% resistance.\n    *   If their effects were simply additive, we might expect a resistance level around 25% (100% - 25% loss from g1 - 50% loss from g3 = 25%).\n    *   The observed resistance of 10% is much lower than either single mutant and lower than a simple additive effect. This strong, more-severe-than-expected phenotype is a **synergistic interaction**. It suggests that G1 and G3 have partially overlapping or compensatory functions. This phenomenon is a hallmark of **gene redundancy**. When one gene is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. When both are knocked out, the pathway they contribute to largely collapses. In this interaction, neither gene is epistatic to the other, as the double-mutant has a novel, more severe phenotype.\n\n### 3. Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate the Options\nLet's combine our conclusions:\n*   G2 is essential for resistance and is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n*   G1 and G3 function in a redundant or parallel manner, as shown by their synergistic interaction.\n*   The problem states at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF). Given that G2's absence completely overrides the effects of the other genes and eliminates resistance, G2 is the most likely candidate to be a master regulator, such as a transcription factor controlling an essential set of resistance genes.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this synthesis:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.**\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: **Incorrect.** Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. The data shows a synergistic interaction for a single trait, which is best described as gene redundancy, not pleiotropy.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect.** The g1g3 mutant has a phenotype (10%) different from both the g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) mutants.\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: **Unlikely.** The data strongly points to G2 being the epistatic gene, suggesting it's the downstream or essential component, not G1. If G1 were a TF for G2, we would expect G1 to be epistatic to G2, which is the opposite of what the data shows.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: **Correct.**\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.** This aligns with its essential role and epistatic nature.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: **Correct.** This is the best description for the synergistic interaction observed in the g1g3 double mutant.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect.** As explained before, their interaction is synergistic, not epistatic. However, this option contains two strongly supported conclusions from the data.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.**\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a specific molecular hypothesis that cannot be proven by this genetic data alone. \"Gene redundancy\" is a more direct description of the observed genetic interaction.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: **Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption **C** provides the most accurate description of the experimental results. It correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. Although the final clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on the data, option C is the \"best-fit\" answer because its first two claims are strongly supported, unlike the other options. The incorrect clause is likely an error in the question's construction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
