    "*   **Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid) = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of HCl (strong acid) = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, this gives 0.08 mol of H+.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 (strong base) = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two OH- ions per formula unit, the moles of OH- are 2 * 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n\n*   **Step 2: Neutralize the strong acid and strong base.**\n    *   The strong acid (H+) and strong base (OH-) will react first in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles of H+ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH- = 0.18 mol\n    *   Since there is more OH- than H+, all the H+ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining after neutralization = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n*   **Step 3: Neutralize the weak acid with the remaining strong base.**\n    *   The remaining strong base (OH-) will now react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since there is more OH- than CH3COOH, all the weak acid will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining after this reaction = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of the conjugate base, CH3COO-.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the final concentration of the excess species.**\n    *   The final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-). The pH will be determined primarily by this excess OH-. The contribution of the weak base CH3COO- to the overall [OH-] is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n    *   Total volume of the solution = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n    *   Moles of excess OH- = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Final concentration of OH-, [OH-] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the pOH and pH.**\n    *   Let's calculate the final [OH-], pOH, and pH.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nmoles_oh_excess = 0.05\ntotal_volume_L = 1.2\n\n# Calculate the final concentration of OH-\nconcentration_oh = moles_oh_excess / total_volume_L\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(concentration_oh)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"Final [OH-]: {concentration_oh:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"pOH: {pOH:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH: {pH:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\nFinal [OH-]: 0.0417 M\npOH: 1.38\npH: 12.62\n\nThe calculated pH is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\n*   **CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n*   **HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.08 mol of H⁺ ions.\n*   **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   Moles = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol. Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that provides two hydroxide ions per formula unit, the moles of OH⁻ are:\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n**2. Neutralize the strong acid and strong base:**\nThe H⁺ ions from the strong acid (HCl) will react with the OH⁻ ions from the strong base (Ba(OH)₂) first.\n*   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n*   Since there are more moles of OH⁻, the H⁺ will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n**3. React the remaining strong base with the weak acid:**\nThe remaining 0.10 mol of OH⁻ will now react with the weak acid, CH₃COOH.\n*   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.10 mol\n*   Since there are more moles of OH⁻ than CH₃COOH, the weak acid will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after this reaction = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**4. Calculate the final concentration and pH:**\nThe final solution contains 0.05 moles of excess strong base (OH⁻). The pH will be determined by the concentration of this excess OH⁻.\n*   **Total volume of the solution:**\n    *   500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n*   **Final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀[OH⁻] = -log₁₀(0.0417) ≈ 1.38\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
