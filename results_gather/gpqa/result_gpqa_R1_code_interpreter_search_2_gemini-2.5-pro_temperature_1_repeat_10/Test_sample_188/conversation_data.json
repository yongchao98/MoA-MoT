    "Pions, phonons, and magnons are all examples of Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which are particles that arise from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry.\n\n*   **Pion:** Pions are the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry in the theory of strong interactions (quantum chromodynamics). The symmetry is not exact because quarks have mass, which is why they are \"pseudo\" Goldstone bosons.\n\n*   **Phonon:** Phonons are the Nambu-Goldstone bosons that result from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry when atoms form a crystal lattice. The continuous symmetry of empty space is broken down to a discrete lattice symmetry.\n\n*   **Magnon:** Magnons are the Nambu-Goldstone bosons that arise from the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in a ferromagnet. In a ferromagnetic material, all the atomic spins align in a particular direction, breaking the original rotational symmetry of the system.\n\n*   **Skyrmion:** A Skyrmion is a topological soliton. It is a stable, localized, particle-like configuration of a field (originally, the pion field). Its stability comes from a topological property (a winding number), not from being a massless excitation of a spontaneously broken symmetry. While the fields that make up a Skyrmion (like the pion field) can be associated with broken symmetries, the Skyrmion itself is a non-perturbative, topological object, not a Nambu-Goldstone boson.\n\nTherefore, the Skyrmion is the particle in this list that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the way that a Goldstone boson is.\n\n<<<D>>>"
