    "This problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n*   **Lifetime and Energy Width:** In the context of quantum states, the lifetime (τ) of a state can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt). The uncertainty in the energy of the state (ΔE) is also known as the natural linewidth (Γ). A common and useful form of the uncertainty principle for this scenario is:\n    Γ ≈ ħ / τ\n\n*   **Resolving Energy Levels:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguishable,\" the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their respective energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this larger width will be the primary factor determining if the levels can be resolved. The condition for resolution is that the energy separation must be significantly larger than the larger of the two linewidths.\n    Let's find the energy width for each state.\n\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   **Energy width of state 1 (Γ1):**\n        Γ1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **Energy width of state 2 (Γ2):**\n        Γ2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Analysis:**\n    State 1 has a shorter lifetime, so it has a larger energy width (Γ1 > Γ2). To resolve the two levels, the energy separation |E1 - E2| must be at least on the order of the larger linewidth, Γ1.\n    Required condition: |E1 - E2| > Γ1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **Comparing with the options:**\n    A) 10⁻⁹ eV  (< 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (< 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    C) 10⁻⁸ eV  (< 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    D) 10⁻⁴ eV  (> 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n    Only option D provides an energy difference that is substantially larger than the energy width of the broader state, ensuring that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\nLet's verify the calculation with a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar = 6.582119569e-16  # eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using Gamma = h_bar / tau\ngamma1 = h_bar / tau1\ngamma2 = h_bar / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 1 (tau1): {tau1:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (Gamma1): {gamma1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 2 (tau2): {tau2:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (Gamma2): {gamma2:.4e} eV\")\n\n# The minimum energy separation for resolution is determined by the larger linewidth\nmin_separation = max(gamma1, gamma2)\nprint(f\"\\nTo be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the larger linewidth.\")\nprint(f\"The larger linewidth is Gamma1 = {min_separation:.4e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-9,\n    \"B\": 1e-11,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-4\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {key}) {value:.1e} eV is large enough for resolution.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key}) {value:.1e} eV is NOT large enough for resolution.\")\n\n```\n\n**2. Final Answer:**\nThe reasoning and calculation show that the larger energy width, corresponding to the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s), is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this value. Comparing the given options, only 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than this minimum required separation.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem about resolving two quantum energy levels.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principle:**\nThe core concept here is the time-energy uncertainty principle, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. It states that the more precisely you know the lifetime of a quantum state, the less precisely you know its energy, and vice versa. The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also called the energy width or linewidth, Γ).\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which for an unstable state is its lifetime (τ).\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\nA common approximation for practical purposes is: Γ ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n**2. Identify the Goal:**\nThe goal is to find an energy difference, |E1 - E2|, that is large enough to \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E1 and E2.\n\n**3. Define \"Resolving\" Energy Levels:**\nFor two energy levels to be resolved, the separation between them must be greater than their inherent energy widths. Each level is not a perfectly sharp line but is \"smeared out\" by an amount Γ due to its finite lifetime. If the separation between the centers of the levels (|E1 - E2|) is smaller than their widths, they will overlap so much that they appear as a single, broader peak. A common criterion for resolution (like the Rayleigh criterion in optics) is that the separation must be at least as large as the width of the levels. To be \"clearly resolved,\" the separation should ideally be significantly larger than the widths.\n\nThe problem involves two different widths, Γ1 and Γ2. The limiting factor will be the *larger* of the two widths. If the separation is not even larger than the larger width, the two levels will definitely overlap significantly.\n\n**4. Plan the Calculation:**\n*   Step 1: Identify the given lifetimes, τ1 and τ2.\n*   Step 2: Identify the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in appropriate units (eV·s, since the desired answer is in eV and lifetimes are in s). ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n*   Step 3: Calculate the energy width (Γ) for each state using Γ = ħ / τ.\n    *   Γ1 = ħ / τ1\n    *   Γ2 = ħ / τ2\n*   Step 4: Determine the larger of the two widths. This sets the minimum energy separation required for resolution.\n    *   Note that the shorter lifetime will produce the larger energy width.\n*   Step 5: Compare the options (A, B, C, D) with the calculated minimum separation. The correct option must be significantly larger than this value.\n\n**5. Execute the Plan (Mental Walkthrough & Python Code):**\n\n*   τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **Calculate Γ1:**\n    Γ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Calculate Γ2:**\n    Γ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Determine the Limiting Width:**\n    The state with the shorter lifetime (τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width (Γ1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). Therefore, to resolve the levels, their energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV (by about three orders of magnitude).\n\nThe python code I generated and the subsequent output confirms this reasoning perfectly. It calculates Γ1 = 6.5821e-07 eV and Γ2 = 6.5821e-08 eV. It correctly identifies that the minimum separation must be greater than the larger width, 6.5821e-07 eV. Then it systematically checks each option and finds that only option D (1e-4 eV) satisfies this condition.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion:**\nThe calculations and comparison are robust. The energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two energy uncertainties. The larger uncertainty is ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Only option D, 10⁻⁴ eV, is greater than this value. Therefore, D is the correct answer. The final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
