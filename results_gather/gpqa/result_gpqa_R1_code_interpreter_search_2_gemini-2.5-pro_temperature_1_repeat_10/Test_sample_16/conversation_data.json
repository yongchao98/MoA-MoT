    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium.**\n    The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is represented by CaY²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ is the fully deprotonated EDTA anion). The complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions in the solution. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n    *   Formation: Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻\n    *   Dissociation: CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Identify the given constants and concentrations.**\n    *   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex: [CaY²⁻]initial = 0.02 M\n    *   Formation constant (also called stability constant): K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰. This constant corresponds to the formation reaction.\n\n3.  **Determine the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction.**\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (Kd) is the inverse of the formation constant (Kf).\n    Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 0.2 x 10⁻¹⁰ = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form upon dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| CaY²⁻ | 0.02 M | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 M | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 M | +x | x |\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation.**\n    Kd = ([Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻]) / [CaY²⁻]\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation and solve for x.**\n    Because the formation constant (Kf) is very large, the dissociation constant (Kd) is extremely small. This implies that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    Now the equation becomes much simpler:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n    Solve for x:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (2 x 10⁻²)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Final check.**\n    The value of x (6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M) is indeed much smaller than 0.02 M, so our approximation was valid. The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], at equilibrium is x.\n\n    [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    This result matches option A.\n\nI will use a python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ninitial_conc_complex = 0.02  # M\nK_formation = 5e10\n\n# The dissociation constant (Kd) is the inverse of the formation constant (Kf)\nK_dissociation = 1 / K_formation\n\n# The equilibrium expression is Kd = x^2 / (initial_conc - x)\n# We can approximate this as Kd ≈ x^2 / initial_conc because Kd is very small\n# So, x^2 ≈ Kd * initial_conc\nx_squared = K_dissociation * initial_conc_complex\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem describes the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex (represented as CaY²⁻) in an aqueous solution.\n\nThe dissociation reaction is:\nCaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\nWe are given:\n*   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, [CaY²⁻]initial = 0.02 M\n*   The formation constant, K_f (or K_Ca-EDTA) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f):\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nNow, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates from the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| CaY²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [CaY²⁻]\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\nSince K_d is very small, the dissociation is minimal. This means that 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore simplify the denominator by making the approximation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe Python code execution confirms this calculation:\n`Code output: 6.32e-07`\nThis value corresponds to 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nC) 2.0x10⁻² M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
