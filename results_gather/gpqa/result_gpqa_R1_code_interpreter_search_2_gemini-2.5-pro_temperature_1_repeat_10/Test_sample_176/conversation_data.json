    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where:\n    *   R is the star's radius.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the star's effective surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the luminosity for each star and then find their ratio:\n    *   L₁ = 4πR₁²σT₁⁴\n    *   L₂ = 4πR₂²σT₂⁴\n\n    The ratio is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information about Radii:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n    *   Substituting this into the ratio equation:\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):** To find this, we need to use the information about the peak wavelengths and radial velocities.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a black body's temperature (T) to the peak wavelength (λ_emitted) it emits in its own rest frame:\n        λ_emitted = b / T  (where 'b' is Wien's constant)\n        This means T = b / λ_emitted.\n    *   **Doppler Shift:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is affected by the star's radial velocity (v_r) relative to the observer. For speeds much less than the speed of light (c), the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is a good approximation:\n        λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)\n    *   **Connecting the pieces:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2).\n\n6.  **Calculate Temperatures based on Observed Data:**\n    *   **For Star_1:**\n        *   v_r,1 = 0 km/s\n        *   λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emitted,1\n        *   So, T₁ = b / λ_emitted,1 = b / λ_obs,1\n    *   **For Star_2:**\n        *   v_r,2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n        *   λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v_r,2 / c)\n        *   This means λ_emitted,2 = λ_obs,2 / (1 + v_r,2 / c)\n        *   So, T₂ = b / λ_emitted,2 = b / [λ_obs,2 / (1 + v_r,2 / c)] = (b / λ_obs,2) * (1 + v_r,2 / c)\n\n7.  **Find the Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):**\n    *   We know λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_obs,1) / [(b / λ_obs,2) * (1 + v_r,2 / c)]\n    *   Since the (b / λ_obs) terms are equal, they cancel out:\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,2 / c)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute this temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation from step 4.\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v_r,2 / c)]⁴\n\n    Now we will compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nR_ratio_squared = 1.5**2  # This is 2.25\nv2 = 700 * 1000           # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458             # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the term inside the parenthesis for the temperature ratio\n# This is (1 + v2/c)\ndenominator_term = 1 + (v2 / c)\n\n# The temperature ratio T1/T2 is 1/denominator_term.\n# We need (T1/T2)^4, which is (1/denominator_term)^4.\ntemp_ratio_pow4 = (1 / denominator_term)**4\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio L1/L2\nluminosity_ratio = R_ratio_squared * temp_ratio_pow4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n2.229230588145143\n</execute_output>\nThe computed value is approximately 2.2292.
