    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular skeleton:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The base formula for this part is C6H4.\n    *   **Functional group (FTIR):** An ester group is present (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms (CO2).\n    *   **Proton NMR (1H NMR) signals:**\n        *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with two signals in the aromatic region strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This pattern has a plane of symmetry, resulting in only two types of chemically equivalent aromatic protons. This accounts for 4 hydrogens on the benzene ring.\n        *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, 1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3.\n            *   Let's denote it as -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   H(a) is coupled only to H(b), so its signal is a doublet (d).\n            *   H(b) is coupled to H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet). Therefore, its signal is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n            *   This fragment accounts for C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group we just identified. The second -CH3 signal must belong to another part of the molecule. Given the presence of an ester, this is most likely a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-O-CO-CH3). In either case, it's a CH3 group.\n        *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possibilities. Any potential structure must not contain a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the pieces to form a plausible structure:**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   The two substituents must be formed from the remaining pieces: a propenyl group (-C3H5) and an ester that includes a methyl group (e.g., -COOCH3).\n    *   Let's construct a possible molecule: Place the propenyl group and a methyl ester group on the 1,4-positions of the benzene ring. This gives us **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n3.  **Verify the proposed structure against the data:**\n    *   **Structure:** It's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester. Correct.\n    *   **NMR Signals:**\n        *   Aromatic H: Two signals (from 1,4-substitution). Correct.\n        *   Vinyl H: One doublet and one dq from the -CH=CH-CH3 group. Correct.\n        *   -CH3 groups: Two signals. One from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**) and one from the methyl ester (-COO**CH3**). Correct.\n        *   -CH2 groups: There are no -CH2- groups in this structure. Correct.\n    *   The proposed structure, methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, fits all the spectroscopic data perfectly.\n\n4.  **Determine the chemical formula of the proposed structure:**\n    *   Benzene ring part (C6H4): 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n    *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n    *   Methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total Carbon:** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Total Hydrogen:** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Oxygen:** 2\n    *   The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Check the given options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C11H14O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C11H12O2\n    *   Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) as a final check:**\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   For C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   In our proposed structure: 1 for the benzene ring, 3 for the double bonds in the ring, 1 for the vinyl C=C bond, and 1 for the ester C=O bond. Total DBE = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6. The DBE matches, confirming the formula is chemically reasonable for the deduced structure. Any other formula would either contradict the structural features (like C11H14O2 with DBE=5) or require adding groups like -CH2- (like in C12H14O2), which are explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
