Understand the System and the Goal**\nThe system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be either +1 or -1. This means there are 2x2x2 = 8 total possible configurations (microstates). The energy of a given configuration is E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The goal is to find the partition function Z, which is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all 8 states:\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\nSince multiple states can have the same energy, this can be simplified to a sum over unique energy levels, where each term is multiplied by its degeneracy (g), which is the number of states with that energy:\nZ = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n\n**2. Enumerate States and Calculate Their Energies**\nWe need to list all 8 states and find their energies. We can group them by the number of +1 (\"up\") and -1 (\"down\") spins.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): The term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = 1+1+1 = 3. So, E = -J(3) = -3J.\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): The term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1+1+1 = 3. So, E = -J(3) = -3J.\n    *   Conclusion: There are **2 states** with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): The term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1-1-1 = -1. So, E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   By symmetry, all states with one spin different from the others will have the same energy. Let's list them:\n        1.  (+1, +1, -1)\n        2.

The disagreement in their final letter choice (e.g., A, B, C, or D) is because they were working with different orderings of the multiple-choice options.

Understand the System and Microstates**\n\nThe system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be in one of two states: +1 or -1. This leads to a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations, also known as microstates.\n\n**2. List all Microstates and Calculate their Energy**\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the formula E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]. We must calculate the energy for each of the 8 microstates. Let's calculate the value of the term `P = S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3`, which will make the energy calculation simpler (E = -J*P).\n\nWe can group the states by their configuration:\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): P = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3.  So, E = -3J.\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): P = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. So, E = -3J.\n    *   We have **2 states** with an energy of **E = -3J**. The number of states with this energy is called the degeneracy, g(-3J) = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   Let's take state (+1, +1, -1): P = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. So, E = -J*(-1) = +J.\n    *   By symmetry, all states with one spin differing from the other two will have the same energy. Let's list them to be sure:\n        *   Two spins are +1, one is -1: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1) -> All have E = +J.\n        *   One spin is +1, two are -1: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1) -> All have E = +J.\n    *   In total, we have **6 states** with an energy of **E = +J**. The degeneracy is g(+J) = 6.\n\n**3. Construct the Partition Function Z**\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, e^(-βE), for all possible microstates. When states have the same energy, we can group them using their degeneracy (g):\nZ = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n\nUsing the energy levels and degeneracies we found:\nZ = [g(-3J) * e^(-β * -3J)] + [g(+J) * e^(-β * +J)]\nZ = [2 * e^(3Jβ)] + [6 * e^(-Jβ)]\n\nSo, the final expression for the partition function is:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**4.

Enumerate All States and Calculate Their Energies**\nWe need to calculate the energy for all 8 states. Let's group them by their configuration.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): The term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 becomes 1+1+1=3. So, E = -J(3) = -3J.\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): The term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 becomes (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1+1+1=3.

The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   Consider the state (+1, +1, -1): The term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 becomes (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1-1-1 = -1. So, E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   By symmetry, all states with one spin different from the other two will have this same energy. These states are:\n        1.  (+1, +1, -1)\n        2.

The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n*   **Verification**: The total number of states is g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\n**3. Construct the Partition Function Z**\nNow we can write the partition function by summing the contributions from the two distinct energy levels:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**4.

The total number of possible configurations, or microstates, is 2³ = 8. These states are:\n- (+1, +1, +1)\n- (+1, +1, -1)\n- (+1, -1, +1)\n- (-1, +1, +1)\n- (+1, -1, -1)\n- (-1, +1, -1)\n- (-1, -1, +1)\n- (-1, -1, -1)\n\n**2.

The energy is E = -J[S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃]. The partition function is Z = Σ exp(-βE) over all states. This foundation is correct and agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy for each State:** To find the partition function, we must calculate the energy for all 8 states. A reliable way to do this is to group the states by configuration.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins aligned.**\n        *   Configuration (+1, +1, +1): The term S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ equals 1+1+1 = 3. So, E = -J(3) = -3J.\n        *   Configuration (-1, -1, -1): The term S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ equals (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1+1+1 = 3. So, E = -J(3) = -3J.\n        *   There are **2 states** (degeneracy g₁ = 2) with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**. This calculation is correctly performed by all candidates.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        *   Configuration (+1, +1, -1): The term S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ equals (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1-1-1 = -1. So, E = -J(-1) = J.\n        *   By symmetry, all states with one spin flipped will have the same energy. These states are: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1) and (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1).\n        *   There are **6 states** (degeneracy g₂ = 6) with an energy of **E₂ = J**.

The partition function is a fundamental quantity in statistical mechanics that encapsulates the statistical properties of a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\n**1. Definition of the Partition Function**\nThe partition function, Z, is defined as the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates of the system.\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\nwhere E is the energy of a given state and β = 1/(kT).\n\nSince multiple states can have the same energy level, we can group them. If g(E) is the number of states (degeneracy) with energy E, the formula can be rewritten as a sum over distinct energy levels:\nZ = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n\n**2. Identifying States and Calculating Energies**\nThe system has three spins, each with two possible values (+1 or -1). Therefore, the total number of microstates is 2³ = 8. We need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states using the given energy formula:\nE = -J[ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n\nTo simplify, let's categorize the states based on their spin configurations.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This category includes two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   For the state (+1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n    *   For the state (-1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n    So, there are **2 states** with an energy level of E₁ = -3J.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct partition function Z for the given system.\n\n### **1. Understand the System and its Microstates**\n\n*   The system consists of three spins (S₁, S₂, S₃).\n*   Each spin can have one of two values: +1 or -1.\n*   Therefore, the total number of possible configurations, or microstates, is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n### **2. Define the Energy and the Partition Function**\n\n*   The energy of any given state is defined by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃].\n*   The partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all 8 microstates. A more efficient way to calculate this is to group states with the same energy level:\n    Z = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n    where g(E) is the degeneracy, i.e., the number of states with a particular energy E.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Energy for Each State and Find Degeneracies**\n\nWe can systematically find the energy of all 8 states by grouping them into two distinct configurations based on symmetry.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This configuration occurs in two microstates: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   For the state (+1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [3] = **-3J**\n    *   For the state (-1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    *   **Conclusion for Case 1**: There are **2 states** with an energy level of E₁ = -3J. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This configuration accounts for the remaining 6 microstates. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, for instance (+1, +1, -1).\n    *   For the state (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = **+J**\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 states in this category will have the same energy. (The states are: (+, +, -), (+, -, +), (-, +, +), and (-, -, +), (-, +, -), (+, -, -)).\n    *   **Conclusion for Case 2**: There are **6 states** with an energy level of E₂ = +J. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n### **4. Construct the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow, we assemble the partition function using the energy levels and their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n### **5. Final Decision and Comparison with Options**\n\nThe correctly derived partition function is **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**.\n\nLet's carefully compare this result with the provided options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated expression perfectly matches option D.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers**: A crucial observation is that nearly all candidate answers correctly derive the mathematical formula Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). The disagreement in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is because they were presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options. This strong consensus on the calculation itself gives very high confidence in the derived formula. Based on the options presented in this specific problem, D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Group States by Configuration and Calculate Energy**\n\nInstead of listing all 8 states individually, we can group them by the number of \"up\" (+1) and \"down\" (-1) spins, as their energies will be the same within these groups due to symmetry.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n    *   Configuration 1: `(S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)`\n        *   `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n        *   `E = -J * (3) = -3J`\n    *   Configuration 2: `(S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)`\n        *   `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`\n        *   `E = -J * (3) = -3J`\n    *   We have **2 states** that share the same energy level, `E₁ = -3J`.

Understand the System and Microstates**\n\nThe system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each spin can have a value of +1 or -1. The total number of possible configurations, or microstates, is 2³ = 8. These states are:\n- (+1, +1, +1)\n- (+1, +1, -1)\n- (+1, -1, +1)\n- (-1, +1, +1)\n- (+1, -1, -1)\n- (-1, +1, -1)\n- (-1, -1, +1)\n- (-1, -1, -1)\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the formula: E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]. We must calculate the energy for each of the 8 microstates. A systematic way to do this is to group the states by configuration.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This includes two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    - For (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    - For (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    *Summary for Case 1*: There are **2 states** with an energy level of **E₁ = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This includes the remaining six states.

Determine the Degeneracy of Energy Levels**\n\nFrom the calculations above, we have two distinct energy levels with the following degeneracies (number of states):\n-   **g₁ = 2** for the energy level **E₁ = -3J**\n-   **g₂ = 6** for the energy level **E₂ = +J**\n\n**4. Calculate the Partition Function (Z)**\n\nThe partition function is the sum over all energy levels, where each term is the degeneracy of the level multiplied by its Boltzmann factor (e⁻βE).\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e⁻βEᵢ\nZ = g₁ * e⁻βE₁ + g₂ * e⁻βE₂\nSubstituting our values:\nZ = 2 * e⁻β(-3J) + 6 * e⁻β(+J)\nZ = 2e³ᴶβ + 6e⁻ᴶβ\n\n**5.

This foundation is correct and agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy for each State:** To find the partition function, we must calculate the energy for all 8 states. A reliable way to do this is to group the states by configuration.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins aligned.**\n        *   Configuration (+1, +1, +1): The term S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ equals 1+1+1 = 3. So, E = -J(3) = -3J.\n        *   Configuration (-1, -1, -1): The term S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ equals (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1+1+1 = 3. So, E = -J(3) = -3J.\n        *   There are **2 states** (degeneracy g₁ = 2) with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**. This calculation is correctly performed by all candidates.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        *   Configuration (+1, +1, -1): The term S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ equals (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1-1-1 = -1. So, E = -J(-1) = J.\n        *   By symmetry, all states with one spin flipped will have the same energy. These states are: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1) and (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1).\n        *   There are **6 states** (degeneracy g₂ = 6) with an energy of **E₂ = J**. This calculation is also correctly performed by all candidates.\n\n3.  **Construct the Partition Function Z:**\n    The partition function sums the contributions from each energy level, weighted by its degeneracy:\n    Z = g₁ * exp(-βE₁) + g₂ * exp(-βE₂)\n    Substituting the values found above:\n    Z = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * J)\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived formula is **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**. Now, let's compare this with the choices given in the question:\n\n    A) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\n    The calculated result matches option A exactly.\n\n**Conclusion on Candidate Answers:**\nAlmost all the provided candidate answers perform the physical calculation correctly. The discrepancy in their final answers (e.g., concluding B, C, or D) arises from incorrectly matching their correctly derived formula to the option letters.

Let's test one, e.g., (+1, +1, -1).\n        *   For (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J.\n        *   By symmetry, all 6 states where one spin is different from the other two ((+,+,-), (+,-,+), (-,+,+), (-,-,+), (-,+,-), (+,-,-)) will have the same energy.\n        *   So, there are **6 states** with an energy level of **E₂ = +J**. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n3.  **Construct the Partition Function (Z):**\n    The partition function is the sum of Boltzmann factors for each energy level, weighted by their degeneracy:\n    Z = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated result is `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`.\n    Let's match this with the given choices:\n    A) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta) - *Incorrect signs in exponents.*\n    B) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta) - *Incorrect energy values.*\n    C) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta) - *Incorrect energy values and degeneracies swapped.*\n    D) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta) - **Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\nA vast majority of the provided candidate answers correctly derive the expression Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). Any discrepancies in their final letter choice (e.g., concluding with <<<A>>>, <<<B>>>, or <<<C>>>) are due to working with a different or mislabeled list of options. The underlying physics calculation is consistently correct across almost all agents and aligns with the derivation above. The correct mathematical expression maps directly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to find the partition function `Z` for a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), each taking values +1 or -1. The energy `E` is given by the formula E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `e^(-βE)`, over all possible states of the system.\n\n**2. Identify All Possible States and Calculate Their Energies**\nSince there are three spins, and each can be in one of two states (+1 or -1), there are a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates. We must calculate the energy for each one.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [1+1+1] = **-3J**\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [1+1+1] = **-3J**\n    These two states have the same energy.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is different from the other two.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [1-1-1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (+1, -1, +1): E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [-1+1-1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (-1, +1, +1): E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [-1-1+1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (+1, -1, -1): E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [-1-1+1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (-1, +1, -1): E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [-1+1-1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   State (-1, -1, +1): E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [1-1-1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    These six states all have the same energy.\n\n**3. Group by Energy Level and Find Degeneracy**\nFrom the calculations above, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E₁ = -3J):** There are **2 states** with this energy. So, the degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E₂ = +J):** There are **6 states** with this energy. So, the degeneracy g₂ = 6.\n(Note: 2 states + 6 states = 8 total states, so we have accounted for all possibilities).\n\n**4. Construct the Partition Function Z**\nThe partition function can be written as the sum over the distinct energy levels, weighted by their degeneracy:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5. Compare with the Candidate Answers**\nAll the provided candidate answers follow the same logical steps and arrive at the same final formula: **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**. The discrepancy in their final letter choice (A, B, C, D) is due to the options being presented in a different order for each agent.\n\nWe must now match the correctly derived formula to the options provided in the question prompt:\n*   A) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   B) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n*   C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n*   D) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nThe derived expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)` perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct partition function Z.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   The system has three spins: S₁, S₂, and S₃.\n*   Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. This means there are a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n*   The energy (Hamiltonian) for a given state is `E = -J[S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃]`.\n*   The goal is to find the partition function, Z, which is the sum of the Boltzmann factor `exp(-βE)` over all possible states.\n*   The formula is `Z = Σ_states exp(-βE)`. When multiple states have the same energy, this can be simplified to `Z = Σ_levels g(E) * exp(-βE)`, where g(E) is the degeneracy (the number of states) at a specific energy level E.\n\n**2. Enumerate States and Calculate Energies**\n\nWe must find the energy for each of the 8 possible states. A state is represented by the triplet (S₁, S₂, S₃).\n\n*   **State Group 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1+1+1] = **-3J**\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1+1+1] = **-3J**\n\n    *Conclusion for Group 1*: There are **2 states** that have an energy of **-3J**.\n\n*   **State Group 2: One spin is different from the other two.**\n    *   Let's test one such state: (+1, +1, -1)\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   All other states in this group are just permutations of this and will have the same energy. Let's list them:\n        1.  Two spins +1, one spin -1: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)\n        2.  Two spins -1, one spin +1: (-1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, -1)\n    \n    *Conclusion for Group 2*: There are a total of 3 + 3 = **6 states** that have an energy of **+J**.\n\n**3. Determine Energy Levels and Degeneracies**\n\nFrom the analysis in step 2, we have found two distinct energy levels:\n*   Energy Level E₁ = -3J has a degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n*   Energy Level E₂ = +J has a degeneracy g₂ = 6.\n(Check: The total number of states is g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.)\n\n**4. Calculate the Partition Function (Z)**\n\nNow we use the formula `Z = g₁ * exp(-βE₁) + g₂ * exp(-βE₂)`:\n*   Z = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (J))\n*   Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nThis can be written as: Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the provided options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated result, **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**, exactly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct partition function Z, we must perform a systematic calculation by considering all possible microstates of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n*   The system has three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can have a value of +1 or -1.\n*   This results in a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\n**2. Energy Calculation**\nThe energy for any given state is defined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all 8 microstates:\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nTo simplify the summation, we can group states that have the same energy level and find their degeneracy (the number of states at that energy level).\n\n**3. Grouping States by Energy**\n\nLet's categorize the states by their spin configurations:\n\n*   **Category 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State 1: (+1, +1, +1)\n        E = -J[ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   State 2: (-1, -1, -1)\n        E = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   There are **2 states** with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Category 2: One spin is different from the other two.**\n    *   Let's test one such state: (+1, +1, -1)\n        E = -J[ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J\n    *   By symmetry, all states with one spin \"flipped\" relative to the majority will have this same energy. Let's list them to be sure:\n        *   Two spins up, one down: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)\n        *   One spin up, two spins down: (-1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, -1)\n    *   There are a total of **6 states** with an energy of **E₂ = +J**. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n**4. Calculating the Partition Function**\nNow we can write the partition function as a sum over the distinct energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\nLet's check the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated result, Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), exactly matches option B.
