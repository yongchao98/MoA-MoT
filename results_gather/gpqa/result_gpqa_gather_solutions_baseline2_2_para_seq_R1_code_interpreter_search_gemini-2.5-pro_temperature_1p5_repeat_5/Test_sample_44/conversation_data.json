Since they have half-integer spin, they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They are confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    The problem defines a base unit of energy as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    Therefore, the energy of the *n*-th level is simply:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n\n    Let's list the first few single-particle energy levels:\n    *   n = 1: $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   n = 2: $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   n = 3: $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   n = 4: $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n3.  **Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A particle's quantum state is defined by its energy level (quantum number `n`) and its spin state (up or down). The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that no two identical fermions can be in the same quantum state. This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy:** The ground state is the lowest possible total energy for the four-particle system. We achieve this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up.\n    *   Place the first two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n    *   Place the next two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy:** The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We find this by creating the lowest-energy excitation, which involves promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (in the ground state) to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   The ground state configuration has the `n=2` level as the highest occupied and the `n=3` level as the lowest unoccupied.\n    *   Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy:** The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider other possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n    *   **First Excitation:** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total Energy = 15E.\n    *   **Next Excitation Possibility:** Move one particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest unoccupied level, `n=3`.\n        *   The new configuration is: one particle in `n=1`, two particles in `n=2`, one particle in `n=3`.\n        *   The total energy is: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   Other excitations, such as moving a particle from `n=2` to `n=4` (total energy 22E) or moving two particles (total energy 20E), result in higher energies.\n\n    Comparing the possible energies above the ground state (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the first excited state has energy 15E and the second has energy 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe analysis of the physics consistently yields the following energies:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while their reasoning is overwhelmingly correct in deriving these values, several made errors in matching their results to the correct letter option. The physical derivation is sound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**Detailed Analysis of the Problem**\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Governing Principles:**\n    *   **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n    *   **Quantum State:** For a particle in this 1D potential well, a quantum state is fully defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which is either +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n    *   **Consequence:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, each level can accommodate a maximum of two particles (one with spin-up, one with spin-down).\n\n2.  **Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n        $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n    *   The problem defines a base unit of energy as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n    *   The first few energy levels are:\n        *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n        *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n        *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n        *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   To find the ground state, which is the state of lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n    *   Place the first two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n    *   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n        $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. We achieve this by performing the lowest-energy excitation possible, which is promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2`, and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n    *   We move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy for the first excited state is:\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    *   The second excited state has the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to find the next lowest-energy excitation from the ground state.\n    *   We've already found the lowest excitation (from `n=2` to `n=3`) results in an energy of 15E. Let's consider other possibilities:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n        *   The configuration becomes: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n        *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    *   The list of possible energies, in increasing order, starts with 10E (ground), 15E (1st excited), 18E (2nd excited), 20E, 22E, ...\n    *   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 30E, 39E, 50E\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\nD) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies perfectly match option A. The provided candidate answers almost unanimously calculate these same energies but frequently make mistakes in selecting the final letter option. The underlying physics calculation is sound and consistently points to `10E, 15E, 18E`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the solution based on the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n### **1. Core Principles**\n*   **System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (e.g., spin-1/2) are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A fundamental rule for fermions is the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** For this system, a particle's quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels of the Well:** The energy for a single particle in the `n`-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Due to the two possible spin states, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **2. Calculation of State Energies**\n\nWe determine the total energy of the four-particle system by distributing the particles among the single-particle energy levels ($E_1=1E$, $E_2=4E$, $E_3=9E$, $E_4=16E$, etc.).\n\n**A. Ground State Energy (Lowest Energy)**\nTo achieve the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   We place two particles in the **n=1** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n*   We place the remaining two particles in the **n=2** level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = \\bf{10E}$.\n\n**B. First Excited State Energy (Next Lowest Energy)**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. We create this by making the smallest possible energy jump for one particle, which is from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   The ground state configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}.\n*   We promote one particle from the **n=2** level to the **n=3** level.\n*   The new configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\bf{15E}$.\n\n**C. Second Excited State Energy (Third Lowest Energy)**\nThe second excited state has the next lowest energy after the first. We must consider other possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n*   **Excitation 1 (First Excited State):** Move a particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = **15E**.\n*   **Excitation 2:** Move a particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n    *   Total Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\bf{18E}$.\n*   **Other Excitations:** Promoting particles to higher levels (e.g., n=2 to n=4) or promoting multiple particles will result in even higher energies (e.g., 20E, 22E).\n\nComparing the possible total energies {10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, ...}, the first three distinct values are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Core Principles**\n\n*   **Particles and Statistics:** The problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions are governed by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States in the System:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n*   **State Occupancy:** As a consequence of the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of **two** particles—one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well is given by:\n`E_n = n^2 * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n`E_n = n²E`\n\nThe first few energy levels are:\n*   `E₁ = 1²E = 1E`\n*   `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`\n*   `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`\n*   `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`\n*   ...and so on.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Multi-Particle State Energies**\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. We must find the three lowest possible total energies by distributing the four particles among the available single-particle states according to the rules above.\n\n#### **A. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state (the state of minimum energy), we fill the lowest energy levels first.\n\n1.  **Level n=1:** Place two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is `2 × E₁ = 2 × 1E = 2E`.\n2.  **Level n=2:** Place the remaining two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is `2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n#### **B. First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is created by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n\n1.  In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2`, and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n2.  We move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n3.  The new particle configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total energy for this configuration is:\n`E_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n#### **C. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. We must consider other possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **First Excitation:** `n=2 → n=3` gave a total energy of **15E**.\n*   **Consider a different excitation:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   New configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two particles in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   Total energy: `(1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Consider another excitation:** Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   New configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`.\n    *   Total energy: `(2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the possible excited state energies (15E, 18E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the second-lowest is **18E**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThe calculated energies `10E, 15E, 18E` correspond to option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly performed the calculations, several made errors in matching their results to the multiple-choice options.

Because they have half-integer spin, they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As identical fermions, these particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Quantum States:** In a one-dimensional potential well, a particle's state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n*   **Occupancy:** The Pauli Exclusion Principle implies that for each energy level `n`, you can place at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**2. Define Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy for a single particle in the n-th level of a 1D infinite potential well is given by `E_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`.\n*   The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`.\n*   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n    *   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n    *   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n    *   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n    *   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n    *   and so on.\n\n**3.

Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider the different possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the second cheapest one.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **Excitation 1 (First Excited State):** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.

The new configuration would be one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   Total Energy: `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promote both particles from `n=2 → n=3`. The configuration would be two in `n=1` and two in `n=3`.\n    *   Total Energy: `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   **Possibility 4:** Promote `n=2 → n=4`. Total energy would be `(2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 22E`.\n\nThe list of the lowest system energies is 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, ...\nThus, the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the calculation method and the resulting energies.

Core Principles Analysis**\n\n*   **System Identification:** The problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. This is a critical piece of information. Identical particles are indistinguishable. Particles with spin-1/2 are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, these particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this context, a quantum state is defined by both the spatial quantum number `n` (for the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down). The consequence is that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles—one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a single particle are given by $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. With the problem's definition of $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels become simple multiples:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   and so on.\n\n**2.

Their energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n    *   Place the remaining 2 particles in the **n=2** level. Their energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n    This result eliminates options A, B, and D, leaving only C.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    This is the state with the lowest energy above the ground state. It is achieved by the minimum energy excitation, which involves promoting one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n    *   Ground state configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}.\n    *   Promote one particle from **n=2** to **n=3**.\n    *   The new configuration is {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n    *   The total energy is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n    This matches the second value in option C.\n\n*   **Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    This is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider other possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n    *   The first excited state had an energy of 15E.\n    *   Consider the next possible excitation: Promote one particle from **n=1** to **n=3**.\n        *   New configuration: {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n        *   Total energy: $E = (1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   We should check if any other excitation has a lower energy. Promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 gives $2E+4E+16E = 22E$, which is higher. Promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3 gives $2E+18E = 20E$, which is also higher.\n    *   Therefore, the second excited state has energy 18E.\n\n**3.

Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A core principle for fermions is the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** In a 1D infinite potential well, a particle's quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (either +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions (one with spin-up and one with spin-down).\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in the n-th level is given by $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Using the problem's definition of $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels are simplified to $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Ground State Energy (Lowest Energy State)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle. We have four particles to place.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy $E_1 = 1^2E = E$):** Place the first two particles here.\n    *   Energy contributed: $2 \\times E = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy $E_2 = 2^2E = 4E$):** Place the remaining two particles here.\n    *   Energy contributed: $2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** Sum the energies of all four particles.\n    *   $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n**3. Calculation of the First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is found by making the smallest possible energy jump for one particle.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two in n=2.\n*   **Lowest Energy Excitation:** Move one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Two particles in n=1 (Energy: $2 \\times 1E = 2E$)\n    *   One particle in n=2 (Energy: $1 \\times 4E = 4E$)\n    *   One particle in n=3 (Energy: $1 \\times 3^2E = 9E$)\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    *   $E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state has the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to examine possible excitations and find the second lowest total energy.\n\n*   **Energy of Ground State:** 10E\n*   **Energy of First Excited State:** 15E\n*   Let's consider other possible single-particle excitations from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Total Energy = $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Total Energy = $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nThe list of possible energies for the system, in increasing order, starts with: 10E (ground state), 15E (first excited state), 18E (second excited state), ...\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**5. Conclusion and Final Answer**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches the values provided in option B. The analysis performed by the candidate agents is overwhelmingly correct in the physics calculation, even if some of them misidentified the final letter in their conclusion. The derived energies are consistently 10E, 15E, and 18E.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1.

Particles with half-integer spin are called **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Identical fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Quantum State:** In this system, a particle's quantum state is defined by two numbers: its principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and its spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down).\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because each energy level `n` can have a particle with spin-up and a particle with spin-down, each level can hold a maximum of **two** fermions.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `E = π²ħ²/2mL²` is the base energy unit.\n    *   `E₁ = 1²E = 1E`\n    *   `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`\n    *   `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`\n    *   `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n### **2. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Level n=1:** Place two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is `2 × E₁ = 2 × 1E = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2:** Place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of these energies:\n*   **E_ground** = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### **3. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by the smallest possible energy jump for one particle, which is from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=2`.\n*   **Promotion:** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n*   **New Configuration:** Two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n*   **Total Energy:** E_first = `(2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)` = `(2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)` = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n### **4. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider other possible excitations from the ground state and find the second smallest energy increase.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excitation (found above):** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total energy = **15E**.\n*   **Next Possible Excitation:** Let's consider promoting a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   **New Configuration:** One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   **Total Energy:** E_second = `(1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)` = `(1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)` = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nOther excitations, such as promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`, result in even higher energies (2E + 4E + 16E = 22E). Therefore, the second excited state has an energy of 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis task requires finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n### Analysis of the Physics\n\n1.  **Particles and Guiding Principles:**\n    *   The system has four identical spin-1/2 particles.

They are confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    The problem defines a base unit of energy as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    Therefore, the energy of the *n*-th level is simply:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n\n    Let's list the first few single-particle energy levels:\n    *   n = 1: $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   n = 2: $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   n = 3: $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   n = 4: $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n3.  **Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A particle's quantum state is defined by its energy level (quantum number `n`) and its spin state (up or down). The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that no two identical fermions can be in the same quantum state. This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy:** The ground state is the lowest possible total energy for the four-particle system. We achieve this by filling the energy levels from the bottom up.\n    *   Place the first two particles in the `n=1` level.

Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n    *   **Quantum State:** For a particle in this 1D potential well, a quantum state is fully defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which is either +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n    *   **Consequence:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, each level can accommodate a maximum of two particles (one with spin-up, one with spin-down).\n\n2.  **Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n        $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n    *   The problem defines a base unit of energy as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n    *   The first few energy levels are:\n        *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n        *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n        *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n        *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   To find the ground state, which is the state of lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n    *   Place the first two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n    *   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level.

We achieve this by performing the lowest-energy excitation possible, which is promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2`, and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n    *   We move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy for the first excited state is:\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    *   The second excited state has the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to find the next lowest-energy excitation from the ground state.\n    *   We've already found the lowest excitation (from `n=2` to `n=3`) results in an energy of 15E. Let's consider other possibilities:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n        *   The configuration becomes: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n        *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    *   The list of possible energies, in increasing order, starts with 10E (ground), 15E (1st excited), 18E (2nd excited), 20E, 22E, ...\n    *   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n*   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n*   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 10E, 15E, 18E\nB) 30E, 39E, 50E\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\nD) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies perfectly match option A.

Core Principles**\n*   **System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (e.g., spin-1/2) are classified as **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A fundamental rule for fermions is the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** For this system, a particle's quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin-up) or `-1/2` (spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels of the Well:** The energy for a single particle in the `n`-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Due to the two possible spin states, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **2.

This means they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal energy quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 for spin-up, -1/2 for spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the well is given by `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `E` is the base energy unit `pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2mL^2)`.\n*   **Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, a maximum of two particles can occupy that level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\n### **2. Calculation of the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the minimum possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards.\n\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy = 1²E = E):** We place the first two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 * E = 2E`.\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of these energies:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n### **3. Calculation of the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. This is found by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    `E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n### **4. Calculation of the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next-lowest energy. We must consider other possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **Possibility A (First Excited State):** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The new configuration would be: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   Total Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. Total Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n*   **Possibility D:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n\nComparing the possible total energies for the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E, and the second-lowest is 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**1. Core Principles Analysis**\n\n*   **System Identification:** The problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. This is a critical piece of information. Identical particles are indistinguishable. Particles with spin-1/2 are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, these particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this context, a quantum state is defined by both the spatial quantum number `n` (for the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down). The consequence is that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles—one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a single particle are given by $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. With the problem's definition of $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels become simple multiples:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   and so on.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Energy Calculation**\n\nThis is the consensus calculation found in all provided answers, and it is the correct physical approach.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli limit of two per level.\n    *   Place 2 particles in the **n=1** level. Their energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$.\n    *   Place the remaining 2 particles in the **n=2** level. Their energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$.\n    This result eliminates options A, B, and D, leaving only C.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    This is the state with the lowest energy above the ground state. It is achieved by the minimum energy excitation, which involves promoting one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n    *   Ground state configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}.\n    *   Promote one particle from **n=2** to **n=3**.\n    *   The new configuration is {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n    *   The total energy is: $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$.\n    This matches the second value in option C.\n\n*   **Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    This is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider other possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n    *   The first excited state had an energy of 15E.\n    *   Consider the next possible excitation: Promote one particle from **n=1** to **n=3**.\n        *   New configuration: {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n        *   Total energy: $E = (1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\mathbf{18E}$.\n    *   We should check if any other excitation has a lower energy. Promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 gives $2E+4E+16E = 22E$, which is higher. Promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3 gives $2E+18E = 20E$, which is also higher.\n    *   Therefore, the second excited state has energy 18E.\n\n**3.

Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\mathbf{10E}$\n\n#### **B. First Excited State Energy**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. We achieve this by moving one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2 and the lowest unoccupied is n=3. We promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    $E_{first} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n    $E_{first} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\mathbf{15E}$\n\n#### **C. Second Excited State Energy**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider other possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy cost.\n*   **First Excitation (found above):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Total Energy = **15E**.\n*   **Next Lowest Excitation:** We can consider promoting a particle from a lower level (n=1) or to a higher level (n=4).

The derived energies are consistently 10E, 15E, and 18E.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Core Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Identical fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Quantum State:** In this system, a particle's quantum state is defined by two numbers: its principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and its spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down).\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because each energy level `n` can have a particle with spin-up and a particle with spin-down, each level can hold a maximum of **two** fermions.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `E = π²ħ²/2mL²` is the base energy unit.\n    *   `E₁ = 1²E = 1E`\n    *   `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`\n    *   `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`\n    *   `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n### **2. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Level n=1:** Place two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is `2 × E₁ = 2 × 1E = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2:** Place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of these energies:\n*   **E_ground** = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### **3. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by the smallest possible energy jump for one particle, which is from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=2`.\n*   **Promotion:** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n*   **New Configuration:** Two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n*   **Total Energy:** E_first = `(2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)` = `(2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)` = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n### **4. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider other possible excitations from the ground state and find the second smallest energy increase.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excitation (found above):** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total energy = **15E**.\n*   **Next Possible Excitation:** Let's consider promoting a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   **New Configuration:** One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   **Total Energy:** E_second = `(1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)` = `(1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)` = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nOther excitations, such as promoting a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`, result in even higher energies (2E + 4E + 16E = 22E). Therefore, the second excited state has an energy of 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis task requires finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n### Analysis of the Physics\n\n1.  **Particles and Guiding Principles:**\n    *   The system has four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n    *   Identical fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state in this system is defined by the energy level (`n`) and the spin projection (`m_s`, either up or down).\n    *   This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   For a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy of a single particle in the n-th level is $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    *   The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of the n-th level is simply $E_n = n^2 E$. The first few levels are:\n        *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n        *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n        *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n        *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation of Total Energies\n\n1.  **Ground State Energy:**\n    *   To find the lowest total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles.\n    *   Place 2 particles in the **n=1** level. Their energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n    *   Place the remaining 2 particles in the **n=2** level. Their energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy** = $2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n2.  **First Excited State Energy:**\n    *   To find the first excited state, we perform the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This involves promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n    *   The new particle configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy** = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n3.  **Second Excited State Energy:**\n    *   The second excited state has the next lowest energy after the first. We must consider other possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-smallest increase in energy.\n    *   **Possibility A (First Excitation):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Total energy = **15E**.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration is {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n        *   Total Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Move both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration is {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n        *   Total Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E,...), the lowest is 15E and the second lowest is **18E**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies, (10E, 15E, 18E), corresponds to option A. The majority of the provided candidate answers correctly performed the physical calculation but failed to match their result to the correct option letter. The physical reasoning is consistent and sound across all candidates, pointing to one unique numerical answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **System:** Four identical spin-1/2 particles. Key properties are that they are fermions and thus must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Potential:** A one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in quantum state *n* is given by $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, which simplifies the single-particle energy levels to $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can be in the same quantum state. A state is defined by both the energy level quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `m_s`. Since `m_s` can be +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **List Single-Particle Energies:**\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n*   **Ground State Energy (E_gs):**\n    To find the lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n    1.  Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n    2.  Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n    3.  The total ground state energy is the sum:\n        $E_{gs} = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    This is the state with the lowest energy above the ground state. It is achieved by the smallest possible energy promotion for one particle. We move one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n    1.  The new particle configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    2.  The total energy is the sum:\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n*   **Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    This is the state with the next-lowest energy. We must consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-smallest energy cost.\n    1.  **Possibility 1 (the first excited state):** Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total energy = 15E.\n    2.  **Possibility 2:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n        *   New configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n        *   Total energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    3.  **Possibility 3:** Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n        *   New configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n        *   Total energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    4.  Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 22E, etc.), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is 18E.\n\n**3.
