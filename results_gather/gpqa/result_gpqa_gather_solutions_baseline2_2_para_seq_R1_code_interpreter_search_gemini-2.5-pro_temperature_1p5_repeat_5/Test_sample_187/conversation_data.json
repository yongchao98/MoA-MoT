The `(1-cosα)²` term cancels from the numerator and denominator, leaving:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    Solving for `d_111`, we get the much simpler and less error-prone formula:\n    $$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** We substitute the given values `a = 10` Angstrom and `α = 30°` into the simplified formula.\n    *   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n    *   $$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} $$\n    *   $$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    *   Using the value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    *   $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} $$\n    *   $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.91068} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297 $$\n    *   $$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n6.  **Evaluate Candidate Answers:**\n    *   The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly calculate the numerical value to be approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n    *   For example, Answer 3 uses the full formula with manual rounding and gets an imprecise `9.62`, but then correctly refers to a more precise code output of `9.54`.\n    *   Other answers (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) all converge on the value of 9.54.\n    *   The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are due to variations in the option lettering provided to each agent.\n\n7.  **Match to Provided Options:** Based on the question presented in this task:\n    *   A) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   B) 10.05 Angstrom\n    *   C) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   D) 9.54 Angstrom\n\n    Our calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom directly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**Analysis of the Provided Answers**\n\n1.  **Problem Identification:** The task is to calculate the interplanar distance, $d_{hkl}$, for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are the lattice constant $a = 10$ Angstrom and the interaxial angle $\\alpha = 30^{\\circ}$.\n\n2.  **Formula Verification:** All candidate answers correctly identify the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal system:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d^2_{hkl}} = \\frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk + kl + hl)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n    Many agents also correctly show that for the specific case of the (111) plane (where $h=k=l=1$), this formula can be algebraically simplified to a much more manageable form:\n    $$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n    This simplification is a key step that reduces the chance of calculation errors.\n\n3.  **Calculation Verification:** Using the simplified formula, we can substitute the given values:\n    *   $a = 10$ Å\n    *   $\\alpha = 30^{\\circ}$, so $\\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\n    Plugging these into the formula:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    Now, calculating the numerical value:\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.91068} \\approx 10 \\times 0.95429 $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 9.5429 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n    This calculation confirms that the numerical result of **9.54 Angstrom** is correct. Almost all candidate answers arrive at this numerical conclusion.\n\n4.  **Discrepancy Analysis:** The main source of disagreement among the candidate answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D).

Agent 3's manual calculation result of `9.62` can be disregarded due to premature rounding of trigonometric values, which the agent itself notes.\n*   **Option Matching Discrepancy:** The primary source of confusion among the candidate answers is the lettering of the options. They were clearly presented with the same four numerical choices but with shuffled labels (A, B, C, D).\n*   **Final Decision:** The crucial step is to match the consensus calculated value (9.54 Angstrom) with the option list provided in the original question prompt.\n\nThe original options are:\nA) 9.54 Angstrom\nB) 9.08 Angstrom\nC) 8.95 Angstrom\nD) 10.05 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The task is to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane, denoted as $d_{111}$, in a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n2.  **Gather Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice constant (interatomic distance), $a = 10$ Angstrom.\n    *   Interaxial angle, $\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 30^\\circ$.\n    *   Miller indices, $(hkl) = (111)$.\n\n3.  **Select the Correct Formula:** For a rhombohedral crystal system, the general formula for interplanar spacing $d_{hkl}$ is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:** A majority of the provided solutions correctly note that for the specific case where $h=k=l=1$, the complex formula can be algebraically simplified.\n    *   Substitute $h=1, k=1, l=1$:\n        *   $h^2+k^2+l^2 = 3$\n        *   $hk+kl+lh = 3$\n    *   By factoring the numerator and the denominator, common terms cancel out. This process leads to a much simpler formula valid specifically for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    *   Solving for $d_{111}$:\n    $$ d_{111} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}{3}} $$\n    This simplification reduces the chance of calculation errors.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** Substitute the given values ($a = 10$ Angstrom, $\\alpha = 30^\\circ$) into the simplified formula.\n    *   $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n    *   $d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})}{3}}$\n    *   $d_{111} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}}$\n    *   Using the value $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n    *   $d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.732}{3}} = 10 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.732}{3}} \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.9107} \\approx 10 \\times 0.9543$\n    *   $d_{111} \\approx 9.543$ Angstrom.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Candidate Answers:** Nearly all candidate answers that performed a precise calculation (either through code or careful manual steps) arrived at a value of approximately 9.54 Å. Some candidates experienced minor discrepancies due to manual rounding, while others seemed to have mismatched the calculated value with the option letters. However, the numerical consensus is clear.\n\n7.  **Final Decision:** The calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
