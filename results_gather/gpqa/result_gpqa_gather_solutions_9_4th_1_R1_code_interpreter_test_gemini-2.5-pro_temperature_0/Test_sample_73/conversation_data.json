The minor discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates stem from inconsistent listings of the multiple-choice options, not from any error in the core logic. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem concerns the radioactive decay of a single atomic nucleus. This is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. The most crucial characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property**: This property means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The atom does not \"age\" or become more likely to decay simply because it has survived for a certain period. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is extraneous information and is irrelevant to the calculation. The question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Set up the Mathematical Model**:\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is the complement of survival: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information**: We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n        `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - S(150)`.\n    *   We can use the properties of exponents to relate the survival probability for 150 minutes, `S(150)`, to the known survival probability for 100 minutes, `S(100)`:\n        `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    *   Now, substitute the value we found in the previous step:\n        `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   The probability of decay within 150 minutes is therefore: `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated probability is `0.4393`, which is `43.93%`. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) 40%\n    *   B) 44%\n    *   C) 48%\n    *   D) 52%\nThe value 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property is Key**: This is the most critical concept. The information that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is extraneous data designed to test the understanding of this principle. Any calculation that incorporates the 50 minutes is incorrect.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability**: It is essential to distinguish between the probability of decay `P(t)` and the probability of survival `S(t)`. The exponential formula `e^(-λt)` directly gives the survival probability. The given decay probability (32%) must first be converted to a survival probability (68%) before being used in the exponentiation step. A common mistake would be to calculate `0.32^1.5`.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation**: The most efficient and accurate method is to manipulate the exponents (`S(150) = S(100)^1.5`). This avoids the intermediate step of explicitly calculating the decay constant `λ` using natural logarithms, which simplifies the calculation and reduces the risk of rounding errors.\n*   **Final Answer Selection**: After calculating the numerical answer (~43.93%), it must be correctly matched to the closest option provided in the original question. The calculated value of 44% corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, drawing upon the consensus from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem deals with the radioactive decay of a single atomic nucleus.

The atom does not \"age,\" and its likelihood of decaying does not change based on how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is extraneous information and is irrelevant to the calculation.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Question**: Due to the memoryless property, the question simplifies from \"Given it has survived 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\" to the more direct question: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n4.  **Set up the Mathematical Model**:\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is the complement of the survival probability: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n5.  **Use the Given Information**: We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (a probability of 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes: `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - S(150)`.

This is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. The most crucial characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property**: This property means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The atom does not \"age\" or become more likely to decay simply because it has survived for a certain period. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is extraneous information and is irrelevant to the calculation of its future decay probability.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Question**: Due to the memoryless property, the question simplifies from \"Given that the atom has survived for 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\" to the more direct question: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n4.  **Set up the Mathematical Model**:\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is the complement of the survival probability: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n5.  **Use the Given Information**: We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (a probability of 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes: `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - S(150)`.\n    *   We can find the survival probability for 150 minutes, `S(150)`, by using the properties of exponents and the value we found in the previous step, without needing to solve for `λ` explicitly:\n    *   `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    *   Now, substitute the known value of `S(100)`: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n7.  **Perform the Final Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   The probability of decay within 150 minutes is therefore: `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion**: The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. Rounding to the nearest whole number, this is 44%.

The information that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is extraneous data intended to test the understanding of this principle. Any calculation that incorporates the 50 minutes is incorrect.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability**: It is essential to distinguish between the probability of decay `P(t)` and the probability of survival `S(t)`. The calculation relies on using the survival probability (0.68) as the base for the exponentiation, which is derived from the given decay probability (0.32). A common error would be to incorrectly use 0.32 as the base.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation**: The most efficient and accurate method is to manipulate the exponents (i.e., `S(150) = S(100)^1.5`).
