It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` leads to the equation `7y = 12x + y`.\n    *   This simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated.\n*   **Conclusion:** The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane. The fact that hydrogenation of all other compounds leads *only* to Z confirms that all compounds share a six-carbon skeleton. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It contains Z (cyclohexane), does not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated or aromatic. As it must be different from cyclohexane, it cannot be another saturated C₆ isomer.\n*   **Careful Point:** The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. This strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated (reduced) compound like cyclohexane, the other is the fully dehydrogenated (oxidized) compound, which would be aromatic.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms to Find the Answer\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The most direct and robust way to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. This allows us to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X without needing to know the exact identity of its components.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis:** We can check if there are plausible molecules for mixture X that fit all constraints. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds, satisfying the condition (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n*   This confirms that the entire chemical scheme is plausible and the result from the conservation law is correct.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently shows this number to be 18. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 16\nB) 12\nC) 18\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first and most crucial step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z, which serves as the anchor for the entire problem.\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The problem states that hydrogenation of all mixtures leads to only Z, and Z is a common solvent. This strongly indicates that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which has 12 hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Y does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as it hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene; it must be either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point**: The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. This strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated compound (cyclohexane), the other is the fully dehydrogenated, stable aromatic compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion**: The second component must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which has 6 hydrogen atoms. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms to Find the Answer\nThe final step uses a fundamental chemical principle to find the answer directly.\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Reaction**: `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point**: The Law of Conservation of Atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. This is the most direct path to the solution, as it does not require identifying the specific components of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation**: We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion**: By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional)\nWe can confirm this result by checking if plausible molecules for mixture X exist.\n*   **Constraints**: The components of X must be C₆ cyclic compounds, be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and have no conjugated multiple bonds. Their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   **Plausible Candidates**: The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are not conjugated, satisfying the condition. This confirms the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently shows this number to be 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by systematically deducing the identities of the substances involved, starting with the most well-defined one (substance Z), and then applying the law of conservation of atoms to the central chemical reaction. This approach avoids any ambiguity and directly leads to the required answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** I will first determine the molecular formula of substance Z using its given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%). Combining this with the information that it's a saturated, common solvent allows for its precise identification.\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Knowing that Z is a component of mixture Y, and that Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction, I can deduce the other component of Y. The properties of Y (does not decolorize bromine water, hydrogenates to only Z) are key clues.\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Atoms:** The core of the solution lies in the disproportionation reaction: `Mixture X -> Mixture Y`. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (the two liquids of mixture Y).\n4.  **Calculate and Conclude:** I will calculate the total hydrogen atoms in the identified components of mixture Y.

It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since the problem states Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The problem states that all compounds involved have the same carbon skeleton and that Z is a common solvent.

The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, as its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene; it must be either saturated or aromatic. As it is different from cyclohexane, the only possibility is that it is aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point:** The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. This strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated compound (cyclohexane), the other is the fully dehydrogenated, stable aromatic compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.

The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since Z is described as saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The problem states that Z is a common solvent and that all hydrogenations lead to it, implying it's a stable, common compound. The most logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, the composition of mixture Y must be determined.\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). Y does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the entire mixture hydrogenates to only cyclohexane. Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene; it must be either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point:** The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer, which strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated compound (cyclohexane), the other is the fully dehydrogenated, stable aromatic compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms to Find the Answer\nThe most direct path to the solution is to analyze the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component, as the mixtures are equimolar:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The Law of Conservation of Atoms is the key principle. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. This allows us to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X without needing to identify its specific components.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nThe remaining information about mixture X confirms the plausibility of this result.\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis:** We need two different, non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The pair that fits this description is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated. This confirms the entire chemical scheme is consistent.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis robustly shows this number to be 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first and most crucial step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving (`7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x`) gives the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane. The fact that it is a common solvent and the sole product of all hydrogenations in the problem points to it being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as it hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene; it must be saturated or aromatic. As it is a different substance from cyclohexane, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion**: The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by applying the law of conservation of atoms to the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We can simply sum the hydrogen atoms in the products to find the total in the reactants.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Identifying Z**: The key is recognizing that the 14.28% mass fraction leads to the formula CₙH₂ₙ, and that for a saturated hydrocarbon, this must be a cycloalkane. The \"common solvent\" clue points specifically to cyclohexane.\n2.  **Carbon Skeleton**: The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields *only* Z (cyclohexane) is a critical piece of information, confirming that all four compounds involved (two in X, two in Y) share the same C₆ cyclic carbon skeleton.\n3.  **Identifying the Second Component of Y**: The combination of properties (C₆ skeleton, does not decolorize bromine water, different from cyclohexane, formed in a disproportionation) uniquely identifies the second component of Y as benzene.\n4.  **Conservation of Atoms**: The most direct and reliable path to the solution is applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms. This allows the calculation of the total hydrogen atoms in the reactants (mixture X) from the known products (mixture Y) without needing to identify the specific components of X.\n5.  **Verification**: The problem's constraints on mixture X (unsaturated, non-conjugated) are satisfied by the pair cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The sum of their hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the entire chemical scheme is plausible and consistent.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently shows this number to be 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the key points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.

Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving (`7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x`) gives the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The problem states Z is saturated. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that hydrogenation of all starting mixtures yields *only* Z implies that all compounds involved share the same carbon skeleton. Combined with Z being a common solvent, this strongly points to the most common C₆ cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton (since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane). Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene; it must be saturated or aromatic. As it is different from cyclohexane, it must be aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. In catalytic reactions of cyclic hydrocarbons, this typically involves hydrogen transfer to create the most stable reduced form (the cycloalkane) and the most stable oxidized/dehydrogenated form (the aromatic compound).\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component, as the mixtures are equimolar:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 4 (The Core of the Solution):** The most direct and robust way to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation.

This confirms that the entire chemical scheme is plausible and the result from the conservation law is correct.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated and would react with hydrogen.\n*   **Conclusion:** The clues that Z is a common solvent and that all other compounds in the problem are based on its carbon skeleton strongly point to it being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is the unanimous and correct starting point in all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the entire mixture hydrogenates to only cyclohexane. Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene; it must be either saturated or aromatic.

In catalysis, this often refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. The formation of the most hydrogenated species (cyclohexane) and the most dehydrogenated species (benzene) from an intermediate is a classic example.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.

It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction 14.28% is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated using atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1) as `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it cannot be an alkene (which is unsaturated) and must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   The problem states that hydrogenation of all starting mixtures yields *only* Z, implying all compounds involved share the same carbon skeleton. Given that Z is a common solvent, the most logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane). Y does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, as it hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since the mixture does not decolorize bromine water, this second component must be either saturated or aromatic. As it is different from cyclohexane, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a **disproportionation**, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. This strongly suggests that the products are the fully hydrogenated (reduced) compound and the fully dehydrogenated (oxidized) compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by applying the law of conservation of atoms to the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Reaction:** We can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Analysis:** According to the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.

Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated and a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated.\n*   **Conclusion:** The fact that Z is a common solvent and the central product of all reactions strongly points to it being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that this second component does not decolorize bromine water means it is not a typical alkene. This property, combined with it being different from cyclohexane, points towards it being an aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The most direct and robust method to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. This allows us to find the answer without needing to identify the specific components of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:** We sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n**4.

It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving for the ratio of atoms gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is saturated, which means it has no double or triple bonds that can react with hydrogen. This rules out an alkene, so Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that hydrogenation of all starting materials leads *only* to Z, and that Z is a common solvent, strongly suggests a stable, common cyclic structure. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the entire mixture hydrogenates to only cyclohexane.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The mixture's failure to decolorize bromine water indicates that its components are either saturated or aromatic.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic and highlighting the critical points required to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first and most crucial step is to determine the identity of hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving (`7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x`) gives the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that hydrogenation of all starting mixtures yields *only* Z implies that all compounds involved (two in mixture X, two in mixture Y) share the same carbon skeleton. Combined with Z being a common solvent, this strongly points to the most common C₆ cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, the composition of mixture Y must be determined.\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton (since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane). Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene; it must be saturated or aromatic. As it is different from cyclohexane, it must be aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The reaction that forms Y is a **disproportionation**. In catalytic reactions of cyclic hydrocarbons, this typically involves hydrogen transfer to create the most stable reduced form (the cycloalkane) and the most stable oxidized/dehydrogenated form (the aromatic compound).\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by applying a fundamental chemical principle to the reaction.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component, as the mixtures are equimolar:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 4 (The Core of the Solution):** The most direct and robust way to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation. This allows us to find the answer without needing to identify the specific components of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:** We sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nThe remaining information about mixture X can be used to confirm the plausibility of the entire chemical scheme.\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Careful Point 5:** We can check if there are plausible molecules for mixture X that fit all constraints. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 and which lack conjugation. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, confirming the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` leads to the equation `7y = 12x + y`.\n    *   This simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated.\n*   **Conclusion:** The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane. The fact that hydrogenation of all other compounds leads *only* to Z confirms that all compounds share a six-carbon skeleton. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It contains Z (cyclohexane), does not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ carbon skeleton. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is either saturated or aromatic. As it must be different from cyclohexane, it cannot be another saturated C₆ isomer.\n*   **Careful Point:** The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. This strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated (reduced) compound like cyclohexane, the other is the fully dehydrogenated (oxidized) compound, which would be aromatic.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms to Find the Answer\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The most direct and robust way to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**.

It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis**: The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point**: A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The problem states that hydrogenation of all mixtures leads to only Z, and Z is a common solvent. This strongly indicates that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which has 12 hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Y does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as it hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene; it must be either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point**: The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction.

Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms to Find the Answer\nThe final step uses a fundamental chemical principle to find the answer directly.\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Reaction**: `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point**: The Law of Conservation of Atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. This is the most direct path to the solution, as it does not require identifying the specific components of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation**: We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion**: By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional)\nWe can confirm this result by checking if plausible molecules for mixture X exist.\n*   **Constraints**: The components of X must be C₆ cyclic compounds, be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and have no conjugated multiple bonds.

The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are not conjugated, satisfying the condition.

Combining this with the information that it's a saturated, common solvent allows for its precise identification.\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Knowing that Z is a component of mixture Y, and that Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction, I can deduce the other component of Y. The properties of Y (does not decolorize bromine water, hydrogenates to only Z) are key clues.\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Atoms:** The core of the solution lies in the disproportionation reaction: `Mixture X -> Mixture Y`. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (the two liquids of mixture X) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (the two liquids of mixture Y).\n4.  **Calculate and Conclude:** I will calculate the total hydrogen atoms in the identified components of mixture Y.

The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, confirming the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently shows this number to be 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to determine the identity of the hydrocarbon Z.\n\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of hydrogen, 14.28%, is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since the problem states Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The problem states that all compounds involved have the same carbon skeleton and that Z is a common solvent. This strongly indicates that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, as its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene; it must be either saturated or aromatic. As it is different from cyclohexane, the only possibility is that it is aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point:** The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. This strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated compound (cyclohexane), the other is the fully dehydrogenated, stable aromatic compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by applying the law of conservation of atoms to the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The most direct and robust way to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. This fundamental principle states that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. This allows us to find the answer without needing to identify the exact structures of the components in mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification and Final Answer\nWe can verify this result by identifying plausible structures for the components of mixture X that fit all the given constraints.\n\n*   **Constraints for X:** The components must be C₆ cyclic compounds, they must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), and they must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Plausible Candidates:** The two compounds that fit this description and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated. This confirms the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since Z is described as saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The problem states that Z is a common solvent and that all hydrogenations lead to it, implying it's a stable, common compound. The most logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, the composition of mixture Y must be determined.\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). Y does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the entire mixture hydrogenates to only cyclohexane. Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene; it must be either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Careful Point:** The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation, a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer, which strongly suggests that if one product is the fully hydrogenated compound (cyclohexane), the other is the fully dehydrogenated, stable aromatic compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms to Find the Answer\nThe most direct path to the solution is to analyze the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component, as the mixtures are equimolar:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The Law of Conservation of Atoms is the key principle. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. This allows us to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X without needing to identify its specific components.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nThe remaining information about mixture X confirms the plausibility of this result.\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis:** We need two different, non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The pair that fits this description is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated. This confirms the entire chemical scheme is consistent.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis robustly shows this number to be 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first and most crucial step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.

For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving (`7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x`) gives the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane. The fact that it is a common solvent and the sole product of all hydrogenations in the problem points to it being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information**: Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis**: One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as it hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a typical alkene; it must be saturated or aromatic. As it is a different substance from cyclohexane, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion**: The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by applying the law of conservation of atoms to the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **Information**: An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis**: The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We can simply sum the hydrogen atoms in the products to find the total in the reactants.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Identifying Z**: The key is recognizing that the 14.28% mass fraction leads to the formula CₙH₂ₙ, and that for a saturated hydrocarbon, this must be a cycloalkane. The \"common solvent\" clue points specifically to cyclohexane.\n2.  **Carbon Skeleton**: The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields *only* Z (cyclohexane) is a critical piece of information, confirming that all four compounds involved (two in X, two in Y) share the same C₆ cyclic carbon skeleton.\n3.  **Identifying the Second Component of Y**: The combination of properties (C₆ skeleton, does not decolorize bromine water, different from cyclohexane, formed in a disproportionation) uniquely identifies the second component of Y as benzene.\n4.  **Conservation of Atoms**: The most direct and reliable path to the solution is applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms. This allows the calculation of the total hydrogen atoms in the reactants (mixture X) from the known products (mixture Y) without needing to identify the specific components of X.\n5.  **Verification**: The problem's constraints on mixture X (unsaturated, non-conjugated) are satisfied by the pair cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The sum of their hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the entire chemical scheme is plausible and consistent.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by applying the law of conservation of atoms to the reaction.\n\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component, as the mixtures are equimolar:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The most direct and robust method to solve the problem is to use the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. This allows us to find the answer without needing to identify the specific components of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:** We sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)\nThe remaining information about mixture X can be used to confirm the plausibility of the entire chemical scheme.\n\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis:** We need two different, non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The pair that fits this description is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated. This confirms that the result obtained from the conservation law is consistent with a chemically sound scenario.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently shows this number to be 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers, the correct logical path to the solution is consistent across all of them. The discrepancies only arise in matching the final calculated number to the correct lettered option. The following is a synthesized, step-by-step derivation of the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is saturated and a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An alkene would have the same formula but would be unsaturated.\n*   **Conclusion:** The fact that Z is a common solvent and the central product of all reactions strongly points to it being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that this second component does not decolorize bromine water means it is not a typical alkene. This property, combined with it being different from cyclohexane, points towards it being an aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The second component is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The most direct and robust method to solve the problem is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. This allows us to find the answer without needing to identify the specific components of mixture X.\n*   **Calculation:** We sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n**4. Verification (Optional but Confirmatory)**\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The problem states that the components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) but have no conjugated multiple bonds. They must be C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogens sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all these criteria perfectly (10 + 8 = 18), confirming the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The analysis consistently shows this number to be 18. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 12\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 22\n\nThe calculated answer is 18, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to determine the chemical identity of substance Z.\n\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a widely used solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 and solving for the ratio of atoms gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is saturated, which means it has no double or triple bonds that can react with hydrogen. This rules out an alkene, so Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The fact that hydrogenation of all starting materials leads *only* to Z, and that Z is a common solvent, strongly suggests a stable, common cyclic structure. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Information:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane). It does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** One component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the entire mixture hydrogenates to only cyclohexane.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The mixture's failure to decolorize bromine water indicates that its components are either saturated or aromatic. Since the second component is not cyclohexane (it's a different liquid), it must be the corresponding aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The aromatic compound with a six-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem is solved by applying the law of conservation of atoms to the reaction.\n\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `(Component A of X) + (Component B of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The most direct and reliable method to find the answer is to use the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. This principle states that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. This allows us to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X without needing to identify its specific components.\n*   **Calculation:** We sum the hydrogen atoms in the known products:\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n*   **Conclusion:** By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional)\nWe can confirm this result by checking if plausible molecules for mixture X exist.\n*   **Information:** The components of X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Analysis:** We need two different, non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all criteria. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, confirming the entire chemical scheme is plausible.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The calculation based on the conservation of atoms shows this number is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
