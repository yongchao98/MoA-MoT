However, the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a near-perfect match, strongly indicating that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Since the reaction involves Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n    *   A D₂ molecule has two deuterium atoms, giving it a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of X.\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent. This points to a common deuterated reagent.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   Let X = LiAlD₄. The violent reaction with liquid Y (which must be D₂O to produce D₂ gas) is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`.\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose and release heavy water, B (D₂O).\n    *   All clues are consistent, confirming that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n### **Step 2: Perform the Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13). Lithium (Z=3) is not included in the calculation.\n*   **Sum the Masses:** The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = **35**\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThe logical deduction and calculation consistently yield the value 35. The options provided in the question are A) 31, B) 25, C) 29, D) 35. The calculated value of 35 corresponds to option D.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n*   **Isotope Identification:** The melting point of B (277 K) is the key to identifying the heavy isotope as Deuterium.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element:** This is determined by atomic number (protons), not atomic mass. Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest, and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest.\n*   **Summation Rule:** The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of the specified elements (i.e., all four Deuterium atoms and the one Aluminum atom).\n*   **Mass Numbers:** The calculation must use the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes (D=2, Al=27), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, a consistent and logical solution emerges. The problem is a chemical puzzle that, when solved step-by-step, reveals the identities of the unknown substances, leading to a final calculation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identification of the Heavy Isotope and Substance B**: The clue that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\" (which is ~3.85 °C) is the key. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C), not normal water (0 °C). This confirms that **Substance B is D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" in question is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W**: The clue that gas W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons points directly to **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. Each Deuterium atom (²H) has one proton and one neutron, so a D₂ molecule has two protons and two neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X**: With the knowledge that Deuterium is involved, Substance X can be identified.\n    *   It is a powerful reducing agent, capable of reducing a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a diol (2 oxygens).\n    *   It and its \"very close analog\" are common reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   The most fitting candidate is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated analog of the very common and powerful reducing agent, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   The described reaction (`LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`) is consistent with all clues: it is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate Al(OD)₃ (G), which upon heating releases D₂O (B).\n\n4.  **Calculation**: The final task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element (by atomic number)**: Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number)**: Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   **Mass Summation**: The calculation must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the specific isotope mass numbers.\n        *   Mass from lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms, each with a mass number of 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom, with a mass number of 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The melting point of B is the most critical piece of information. Misinterpreting it as normal water would make the puzzle unsolvable.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The determination of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass. In LiAlD₄, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest.\n*   **Isotope Mass Numbers**: The calculation must use the mass number of the specific isotopes involved (2 for Deuterium, 27 for Aluminum), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n*   **Summation of All Atoms**: The problem requires summing the mass of *all* atoms of the specified elements. It is crucial to account for the four Deuterium atoms in the molecule.\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated number, 35, must be correctly matched to the corresponding letter in the provided options.\n\nThe analysis consistently leads to the value 35. Based on the options provided in the prompt (A) 31, B) 35, C) 25, D) 29), the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first break down the chemical puzzle to confirm the identity of Substance X, then perform the required calculation. I will pay close attention to the definitions and instructions in the question to avoid common pitfalls. Finally, I will write a Python script to perform the calculation and determine the correct option based on the provided list.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Substances:**\n    *   **Substance B & Heavier Isotope:** The melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\" (3.85 °C). This is a near-perfect match for heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C. This identifies B as D₂O and the heavier isotope as Deuterium (D). This conclusion is unanimously reached by all detailed candidate answers.\n    *   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Since Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron) is involved, Deuterium gas (D₂) fits perfectly (2 protons, 2 neutrons).\n    *   **Substance X:** X contains Deuterium and is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry (it reduces a keto acid to a diol, decreasing the oxygen count from 3 to 2). Its non-deuterated analog is very common. This points directly to Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), the deuterated version of the common reagent LiAlH₄. The described reaction with liquid Y (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) which releases D₂O upon heating confirms this identification.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Lightest element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1). The isotope is Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Heaviest element (by atomic number):** Aluminum (Z=13). The isotope is the common ²⁷Al.\n    *   The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements.\n    *   Mass from Deuterium: There are 4 atoms, each with a mass number of 2. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from Aluminum: There is 1 atom, with a mass number of 27. Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Careful Points:**\n    *   The identification of the heavy isotope (Deuterium) is the crucial first step.\n    *   \"Lightest\" and \"heaviest\" refer to the elements' atomic numbers, not their mass numbers or positions in the chemical formula.\n    *   The calculation must include all four atoms of the lightest element's isotope.\n    *   The final step is to correctly map the calculated value (35) to the options provided in the original question: A) 35, B) 29, C) 31, D) 25.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   The calculation consistently yields 35.\n    *   In the provided options, 35 corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the substance and its constituent elements based on the puzzle's logic.\n# The substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n# The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n# Step 2: Identify the lightest and heaviest elements by atomic number.\n# Lightest element: Hydrogen (Z=1).

The candidate answers unanimously and correctly deduce the identities of the key substances through a logical analysis of the clues.\n    *   **Substance B**: The melting point of \"very close to 277 K\" (3.85 °C) is a near-perfect match for heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C. This identifies B as D₂O and the \"heavier isotope\" as Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Gas W**: A molecule with an equal number of protons and neutrons, in a reaction involving Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), is identified as Deuterium gas (D₂), which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: The clues point to a powerful deuterated reducing agent common in organic chemistry. Its ability to reduce a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a diol (2 oxygens) confirms its strength. This, combined with the other clues, definitively identifies Substance X as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. The reaction sequence described in the problem is perfectly consistent with the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O.\n\n2.  **Calculation**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Elements in X**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen (Atomic Number Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminum (Atomic Number Z=13).\n    *   **Mass Summation**: The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n        *   Mass from lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D), each with a mass number of 2.

Misinterpreting 277 K would make the puzzle unsolvable.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest**: The determination of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on atomic number (protons), not atomic mass. This correctly identifies Hydrogen and Aluminum, excluding Lithium from the final calculation.\n*   **Summation of All Atoms**: The instruction to sum the masses of *all* instances of the relevant atoms is crucial. The calculation must include all four deuterium atoms, not just one.\n*   **Use of Mass Numbers**: The problem implies the use of integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes (2 for Deuterium, 27 for Aluminum), which simplifies the calculation.\n*   **Matching to Options**: The final calculated value of 35 must be correctly matched to the corresponding letter from the original list of options: A) 29, B) 35, C) 31, D) 25.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe logical deduction consistently identifies the substance as LiAlD₄, and the calculation consistently yields a result of 35. Matching this result to the provided options, 35 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Chemical Clues\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each unknown substance.\n\n1.  **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The most critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives approximately 3.85 °C. This value is nearly identical to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n3.  **Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of X:\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent. This points to a deuterated version of a standard chemical.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a very powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohols.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n4.  **Reaction Verification**: The entire sequence is consistent with X being LiAlD₄. The violent reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` produces the correct gas (W) and a precipitate (G, aluminum deuteroxide). Heating this precipitate G would cause it to decompose and release D₂O (B).\n\n### Step 2: Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\" (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Summation of Masses**: The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from Lightest Element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from Heaviest Element (Aluminum)**: There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The melting point of B (277 K) is the crucial starting point. Misinterpreting this as normal water would make the problem unsolvable.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on atomic number (number of protons), not atomic mass. Therefore, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest, while Lithium (Z=3) is not included in the final calculation.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of the relevant elements. It is critical to account for all four Deuterium atoms.\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Atomic Weight**: The calculation must use the mass number of the specific isotope (Deuterium, mass = 2), not the average atomic weight of the element from the periodic table.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe logical deduction and calculation consistently yield the value 35. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 31\nB) 35\nC) 25\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and the final decision.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe consensus among all detailed candidate answers follows a clear and logical path to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n1.  **Identification of the Substances**:\n    *   **Substance B**: The clue that its melting point is \"very close to 277 K\" (which is ~3.85 °C) is a strong indicator. This value is nearly identical to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This correctly identifies **B as D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   **Gas W**: The clue that its molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons points directly to **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: The clues indicate that X is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, contains Deuterium, and has a common non-deuterated analog. Its reaction with a keto acid (3 oxygens) to form a product with 2 oxygens (a diol) confirms its strength. This leads to the identification of X as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated analog of the common reagent Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Reaction Verification**: The entire reaction sequence `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` is chemically sound. It is a violent reaction that produces the correct gas (W) and a precipitate (G, aluminum deuteroxide), which upon heating releases heavy water (B).\n\n2.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number (Z) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   Mass from lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium, each with a mass number of 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum, with a mass number of 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly identifying the 277 K melting point with D₂O, which unlocks the identity of the isotope as Deuterium.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on atomic number (number of protons), not atomic mass. Therefore, Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13) are chosen, while Lithium (Z=3) is ignored.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The instruction to sum the masses of *all* instances of the relevant elements is critical. This means accounting for all four Deuterium atoms.\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Average Atomic Mass**: The calculation must use the mass number of the specific isotope (2 for Deuterium), not the average atomic mass of hydrogen from the periodic table (~1.008).\n*   **Final Answer Mapping**: The calculated numerical answer, 35, must be correctly matched to the options provided in the original question: A) 25, B) 35, C) 31, D) 29.

However, the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This near-perfect match strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Since the reaction involves Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n    *   A D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n\n3.  **Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of X.\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent. This points to a common deuterated reagent.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a very powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group to alcohols.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n4.  **Verification of the Reaction Sequence**:\n    *   The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` is consistent with all clues. It is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).

This also identifies the heavier isotope as **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Since we have established the involvement of Deuterium (D), which has 1 proton and 1 neutron, the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n    *   A D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n\n3.  **Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of X.\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\".

Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives approximately 3.85 °C. This value is extremely close to the known melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**, and therefore the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n*   **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".

This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   The clue that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons was correctly used to identify **Gas W as Deuterium gas (D₂)**, as a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   The combination of clues—that Substance X contains Deuterium, is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry capable of reducing a keto acid to a diol, and reacts violently with heavy water to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate—led to the correct identification of **Substance X as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The question requires the calculation of the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D, Z=1).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The calculation involves summing the mass numbers of all atoms of these two elements, using the specific isotopes present: four atoms of Deuterium (mass number = 2) and one atom of Aluminum (mass number = 27).\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (4 × Mass of Deuterium) + (1 × Mass of Aluminum)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly interpreting the melting point of 277 K as belonging to heavy water (D₂O), which definitively identifies the isotope in question as Deuterium.\n*   **Defining Lightest and Heaviest**: The \"lightest\" and \"heaviest\" elements must be determined by their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass. Therefore, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest, while Lithium (Z=3) is ignored for the calculation.\n*   **Summation of All Atoms**: The problem specifies summing the masses of *all* instances of the relevant isotopes. It is critical to include all four Deuterium atoms in the calculation (4 x 2), not just a single atom.\n*   **Using Isotope Mass Numbers**: The calculation should use the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (²H and ²⁷Al), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated value of 35 must be correctly matched to the corresponding letter from the original options provided: A) 31, B) 35, C) 25, D) 29.\n\nThe analysis consistently and correctly identifies the substance and performs the calculation, resulting in a value of 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, the following conclusion is reached.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The first critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) yields approximately 3.85 °C. This value is extremely close to the known melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**, and consequently, the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D)**. This conclusion was unanimously reached by all detailed candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**: The gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules that contain an equal number of neutrons and protons. Since the reaction involves Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition. This was also a point of consensus.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms, which requires a very powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The most common reagent with this capability is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly. The described reaction sequence (violent reaction with D₂O, production of D₂ gas, and a precipitate that yields D₂O upon heating) is entirely consistent with the chemistry of LiAlD₄.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\" (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element (by atomic number)**: Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number)**: Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   **Summation**: The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of the stable Aluminum (²⁷Al) isotope. The mass number is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The melting point of B (277 K) is the key to identifying the heavy isotope as Deuterium (D) by matching it to the melting point of D₂O.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The determination of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass. Therefore, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest, not Lithium (Z=3).\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Atomic Weight**: The calculation must use the mass number of the specific isotope involved (Deuterium, mass number = 2), not the average atomic weight of the element from the periodic table.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The instruction to sum the masses of *all* atoms of the relevant elements (four Deuterium atoms and one Aluminum atom) must be followed precisely.\n*   **Option Mapping**: The candidate answers show that while the calculation of the value \"35\" was consistent, there was confusion in mapping this value to the correct lettered option (A, B, C, or D). It is crucial to map the final calculated value to the specific list of options provided in the original question. For the given options (A) 29, (B) 31, (C) 25, (D) 35, the correct choice is D.\n\nThe analysis consistently and robustly leads to the value of 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, the following definitive solution is reached.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe consensus among all detailed candidate answers follows a clear and logical path to solve the chemical puzzle. The reasoning is robust and consistent.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substances**:\n    *   **Substance B & Heavier Isotope**: The clue that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\" (approximately 3.85 °C) is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This correctly identifies **B as D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   **Gas W**: The clue that the molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons points directly to **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: The clues indicate that X is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, contains Deuterium, and has a common non-deuterated analog. Its ability to reduce a keto acid (3 oxygens) to a product with 2 oxygens (a diol) confirms its strength. This leads to the definitive identification of X as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated analog of the common reagent Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Reaction Verification**: The entire reaction sequence `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` is chemically sound and consistent with all clues.\n\n2.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number (Z) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium, each with a mass number of 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum, with a mass number of 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The most crucial step is correctly interpreting the melting point of ~277 K as belonging to heavy water (D₂O), not normal water. This is the key that unlocks the entire puzzle.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass or position in the chemical formula. This correctly identifies Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13), excluding Lithium (Z=3) from the final calculation.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The problem asks for the \"cumulative\" mass and to sum the masses of \"all\" instances of the elements. This means the stoichiometry within the molecule must be used (i.e., all four Deuterium atoms must be included in the sum).\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Average Atomic Weight**: The calculation must use the integer mass number of the specific isotope involved (Deuterium, mass number = 2), not the average atomic weight of the element from the periodic table (e.g., ~1.008 for Hydrogen).\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated numerical value (35) must be carefully matched to the corresponding letter in the specific list of options provided in the question. The candidate answers showed variation in their final letter choice only because the options were shuffled in their prompts.\n\nThe logical deduction and calculation consistently yield a value of 35. Based on the options provided in the question (A) 35, B) 25, C) 31, D) 29), the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This identifies B as D₂O and the \"heavier isotope\" as Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Gas W**: A molecule with an equal number of protons and neutrons, in a reaction involving Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), is identified as Deuterium gas (D₂), which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: The clues point to a powerful deuterated reducing agent common in organic chemistry.

Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives approximately 3.85 °C. This value is nearly identical to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n3.  **Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of X:\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent. This points to a deuterated version of a standard chemical.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a very powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohols.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n4.  **Reaction Verification**: The entire sequence is consistent with X being LiAlD₄. The violent reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` produces the correct gas (W) and a precipitate (G, aluminum deuteroxide). Heating this precipitate G would cause it to decompose and release D₂O (B).\n\n### Step 2: Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\" (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Summation of Masses**: The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from Lightest Element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from Heaviest Element (Aluminum)**: There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The melting point of B (277 K) is the crucial starting point. Misinterpreting this as normal water would make the problem unsolvable.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on atomic number (number of protons), not atomic mass. Therefore, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest, while Lithium (Z=3) is not included in the final calculation.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of the relevant elements. It is critical to account for all four Deuterium atoms.\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Atomic Weight**: The calculation must use the mass number of the specific isotope (Deuterium, mass = 2), not the average atomic weight of the element from the periodic table.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe logical deduction and calculation consistently yield the value 35.

This correctly identifies **B as D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   **Gas W**: The clue that its molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons points directly to **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Substance X**: The clues indicate that X is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, contains Deuterium, and has a common non-deuterated analog. Its reaction with a keto acid (3 oxygens) to form a product with 2 oxygens (a diol) confirms its strength. This leads to the identification of X as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, the deuterated analog of the common reagent Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Reaction Verification**: The entire reaction sequence `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` is chemically sound. It is a violent reaction that produces the correct gas (W) and a precipitate (G, aluminum deuteroxide), which upon heating releases heavy water (B).\n\n2.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number (Z) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   Mass from lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium, each with a mass number of 2.

Therefore, Hydrogen (Z=1) and Aluminum (Z=13) are chosen, while Lithium (Z=3) is ignored.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The instruction to sum the masses of *all* instances of the relevant elements is critical. This means accounting for all four Deuterium atoms.\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Average Atomic Mass**: The calculation must use the mass number of the specific isotope (2 for Deuterium), not the average atomic mass of hydrogen from the periodic table (~1.008).\n*   **Final Answer Mapping**: The calculated numerical answer, 35, must be correctly matched to the options provided in the original question: A) 25, B) 35, C) 31, D) 29.

The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)` is violent, produces the correct gas and precipitate, and the precipitate (aluminum deuteroxide) decomposes upon heating to release heavy water.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X, which has been identified as LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element**: By atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element**: By atomic number, the heaviest element is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Instruction**: The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D), with a mass number of 2.

Comparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 29\nB) 25\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to arrive at the final, correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The first and most critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K is approximately 3.85 °C.\n    *   This value is extremely close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), whereas normal water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C.\n    *   This strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**. Consequently, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules that \"contain the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   A Deuterium atom (D, or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a molecule of Deuterium gas (D₂) contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n    *   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of Substance X.\n    *   It contains Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry with a \"very close analog\" that is also commonly used. This points to a common deuterated reagent.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohols.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n    *   The reaction sequence is also consistent: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)`. This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate G (Aluminum Deuteroxide), which upon heating releases B (D₂O).\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** This is determined by atomic number (Z). The lightest is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13). Lithium (Z=3) is not part of the calculation.\n    *   **Summation:** The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass number of the specific isotopes.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **four** atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **one** atom of the stable Aluminum (²⁷Al) isotope. The mass number of Al is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Isotope Identification:** The correct identification of D₂O from its melting point is the key that unlocks the entire puzzle.\n*   **Lightest/Heaviest Element Definition:** The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on atomic number (H and Al), not atomic mass.\n*   **Use of Isotope Mass:** The calculation requires using the mass number of the specific isotope (Deuterium, mass=2), not the average atomic mass of hydrogen from the periodic table.\n*   **Summation Rule:** The phrase \"cumulative atomic masses\" and the instruction to sum the masses of \"all\" instances means you must account for the stoichiometry within the molecule (i.e., four Deuterium atoms).\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The final calculated value of 35 must be correctly matched to the given options: A) 29, B) 31, C) 25, D) 35.\n\nThe correct calculation yields 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruction of the Chemical Clues**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each unknown substance.\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The most critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives approximately 3.85 °C. This value is extremely close to the known melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**, and therefore the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n*   **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Since we have identified Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron) as the key isotope, the most logical candidate for the gas is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule contains a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n*   **Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n    1.  It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    2.  It and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent and its deuterated version, such as LiAlH₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    3.  It reduces a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This transformation (e.g., R-CO-COOH to R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)) requires a very powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid. Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) is the classic reagent for this.\n    4.  The reaction of X with liquid Y (which must be D₂O) is violent and produces gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B (D₂O).\n\n*   **Verification**: Let's assume **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` is consistent with all clues. It is violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide (G). Heating this precipitate would cause it to decompose and release heavy water (B), confirming the entire sequence.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: The lightest and heaviest elements are determined by their atomic number (Z).\n    *   Lightest: Hydrogen (Z=1)\n    *   Heaviest: Aluminum (Z=13)\n*   **Sum the Masses**: The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: The molecule contains four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum**:\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = **35**\n\n### **Step 3: Careful Points and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Isotope Identification**: The key is correctly linking the 277 K melting point to D₂O, which identifies the isotope as Deuterium.\n2.  **Element Selection**: The lightest and heaviest elements (H and Al) must be chosen based on atomic number, not mass. Lithium (Z=3) is correctly excluded from the calculation.\n3.  **Summation Rule**: The calculation must include all atoms of the relevant elements (four Deuterium atoms and one Aluminum atom).\n4.  **Final Value**: The calculation consistently and correctly yields a value of 35.\n\nMatching this calculated value to the provided options:\nA) 35\nB) 25\nC) 31\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, a definitive answer can be determined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nAll candidate answers that provided a detailed breakdown followed the same logical path to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substances**:\n    *   The clue regarding the melting point of substance B being \"very close to 277 K\" (3.85 °C) was unanimously and correctly interpreted as identifying **Substance B as heavy water (D₂O)**, which has a melting point of 3.82 °C. This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   The clue that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons was correctly used to identify **Gas W as Deuterium gas (D₂)**, as a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   The combination of clues—that Substance X contains Deuterium, is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry capable of reducing a keto acid to a diol, and reacts violently with heavy water to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate—led to the correct identification of **Substance X as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The question requires the calculation of the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D, Z=1).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The calculation involves summing the mass numbers of all atoms of these two elements, using the specific isotopes present: four atoms of Deuterium (mass number = 2) and one atom of Aluminum (mass number = 27).\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (4 × Mass of Deuterium) + (1 × Mass of Aluminum)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The crucial first step is correctly interpreting the melting point of 277 K as belonging to heavy water (D₂O), which definitively identifies the isotope in question as Deuterium.\n*   **Defining Lightest and Heaviest**: The \"lightest\" and \"heaviest\" elements must be determined by their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass. Therefore, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest, while Lithium (Z=3) is ignored for the calculation.\n*   **Summation of All Atoms**: The problem specifies summing the masses of *all* instances of the relevant isotopes. It is critical to include all four Deuterium atoms in the calculation (4 x 2), not just a single atom.\n*   **Using Isotope Mass Numbers**: The calculation should use the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (²H and ²⁷Al), not the average atomic weights from the periodic table.\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The final calculated value of 35 must be correctly matched to the corresponding letter from the original options provided: A) 31, B) 35, C) 25, D) 29.\n\nThe analysis consistently and correctly identifies the substance and performs the calculation, resulting in a value of 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and a step-by-step deconstruction of the problem, the following conclusion is reached.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The first critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) yields approximately 3.85 °C. This value is extremely close to the known melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**, and consequently, the \"heavier isotope\" is **Deuterium (D)**. This conclusion was unanimously reached by all detailed candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**: The gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules that contain an equal number of neutrons and protons. Since the reaction involves Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition. This was also a point of consensus.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms, which requires a very powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The most common reagent with this capability is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly. The described reaction sequence (violent reaction with D₂O, production of D₂ gas, and a precipitate that yields D₂O upon heating) is entirely consistent with the chemistry of LiAlD₄.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\" (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element (by atomic number)**: Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number)**: Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   **Summation**: The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of the stable Aluminum (²⁷Al) isotope. The mass number is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum**: 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The melting point of B (277 K) is the key to identifying the heavy isotope as Deuterium (D) by matching it to the melting point of D₂O.\n*   **Lightest vs. Heaviest Element**: The determination of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on their atomic number (number of protons), not their atomic mass. Therefore, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest, not Lithium (Z=3).\n*   **Isotope Mass vs. Atomic Weight**: The calculation must use the mass number of the specific isotope involved (Deuterium, mass number = 2), not the average atomic weight of the element from the periodic table.\n*   **Summation Rule**: The instruction to sum the masses of *all* atoms of the relevant elements (four Deuterium atoms and one Aluminum atom) must be followed precisely.\n*   **Option Mapping**: The candidate answers show that while the calculation of the value \"35\" was consistent, there was confusion in mapping this value to the correct lettered option (A, B, C, or D). It is crucial to map the final calculated value to the specific list of options provided in the original question. For the given options (A) 29, (B) 31, (C) 25, (D) 35, the correct choice is D.\n\nThe analysis consistently and robustly leads to the value of 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
