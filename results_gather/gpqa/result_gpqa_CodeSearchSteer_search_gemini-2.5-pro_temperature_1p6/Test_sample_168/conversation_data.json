    "Based on the principles of nuclear decay physics, we can determine the characteristics of the energy spectrum for the two scenarios.\n\n**1. Nature of the Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)**\n\n*   **Original Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V):** In this decay, the total energy released (the Q-value) is shared among the kinetic energies of the final particles (the 2 B nucleons, the 2 E particles, and the 2 V particles). Since there are more than two particles in the final state, the energy of the E particles is not fixed. The two V particles (neutrinos) carry away a variable amount of energy, which means the sum of the energies of the two E particles must also be variable to conserve total energy. This results in a continuous energy spectrum.\n*   **Variant Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M):** Here, the final particles are the 2 B nucleons, the 2 E particles, and the single massless particle M. Just as in the original decay, the final state consists of more than two bodies. The available energy is shared between them, and the particle M can carry away a variable amount of this energy. Therefore, the total energy of the two E particles is not fixed, and the spectrum remains continuous. The replacement of two particles (2V) with one (M) changes the way energy is distributed, which alters the specific shape of the spectrum. Many sources confirm that Majoron-emitting double-beta decay results in a continuous spectrum with a different shape from the standard two-neutrino decay.\n\nSince the spectrum remains continuous, options A and C are incorrect.\n\n**2. Endpoint of the Spectrum**\n\nThe endpoint of the total kinetic energy spectrum for the E particles represents the maximum possible energy they can have. This occurs when the other light particles emitted in the decay carry away the minimum possible energy.\n\n*   **Original Decay (2V emitted):** The `V` particles are analogous to neutrinos, which are now known to have a small, non-zero mass (`m_V > 0`). The total energy released in the decay, the Q-value, depends on the masses of the initial and final particles:\n    `Q_original = m(2A)c² - [m(2B)c² + 2m(E)c² + 2m_V(V)c²]`\n    This Q-value is the maximum possible sum of the kinetic energies of the E particles.\n*   **Variant Decay (M emitted):** The problem states that particle M is **massless** (`m_M = 0`). The Q-value for this decay is:\n    `Q_variant = m(2A)c² - [m(2B)c² + 2m(E)c² + m(M)c²]`\n*   **Comparison:** Since the mass of the two V particles (`2m_V`) is greater than the mass of the single M particle (`m_M = 0`), less mass is created in the final state of the variant decay. According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, this means more energy is converted into kinetic energy. Therefore, the Q-value for the variant decay is higher than for the original decay:\n    `Q_variant > Q_original`.\n\nThe endpoint of the spectrum for the E particles corresponds to the Q-value of the reaction. Because `Q_variant` is greater than `Q_original`, the endpoint of the spectrum for the variant decay is higher.\n\nCombining these findings: The spectrum remains continuous, its shape is adjusted, and its endpoint increases.\n\n<<<B>>>"
