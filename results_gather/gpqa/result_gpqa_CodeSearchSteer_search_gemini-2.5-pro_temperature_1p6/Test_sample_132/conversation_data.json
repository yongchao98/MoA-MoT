    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), a multi-step calculation based on the dissociation equilibria of phosphoric acid is required.\n\nFirst, calculate the initial molar concentrations of the two phosphate species in the solution.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n*   **Volume of the solution:**\n    200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n\nNow, find the concentration of each component:\n\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    0.007348 moles / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    0.005618 moles / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\nThe solution is a buffer containing the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. This pair is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₂. We can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer.\n\n*   **The equilibrium is:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **The expression for Ka₂ is:** Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   **Solving for [H⁺]:** [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   **Substituting the values:** [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\nFinally, the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, which is governed by Ka₃.\n\n*   **The equilibrium is:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **The expression for Ka₃ is:** Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   **Solving for [PO₄³⁻]:** [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   **Substituting the known and calculated values:** [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11x10⁻⁸)\n\nAfter performing the calculation:\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis step-by-step approach, using the successive dissociation constants of the polyprotic phosphoric acid, is the standard method for finding the concentration of minor species in a buffer solution.\n\n<<<A>>>"
