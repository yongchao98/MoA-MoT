    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nTo find the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$, we must consider the state of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The retarded time is when the electromagnetic field was generated by the charge, and it is defined by the condition that the time difference ($t - t_r$) equals the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position to the observer at the speed of light, $c$.\n\nGiven the notation in the problem:\n*   $q$: the point charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: the distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $t = t_r + d/c$: the relationship between observation time and retarded time.\n\nThe standard form of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript $t_r$ indicates that the quantities inside the brackets (d, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) are all evaluated at the retarded time.\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator of these expressions by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expressions for V and $\\vec{A}$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option D. It's also worth noting that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by the formula $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
