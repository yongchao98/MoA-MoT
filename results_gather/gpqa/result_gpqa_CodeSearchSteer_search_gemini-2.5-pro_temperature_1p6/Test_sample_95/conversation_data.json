    "To determine the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy, we can follow a series of calculations based on the provided information and fundamental physics principles.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Event Horizon's Physical Size\n\nFirst, we determine the diameter of the event horizon. The relationship between angular size (θ), physical size (D), and distance (d) is given by the small-angle formula: D ≈ d * θ.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** The galaxy is at a distance of 10¹⁰ parsecs. We convert this to meters:\n    d = 10¹⁰ pc * (3.086 x 10¹⁶ m/pc) = 3.086 x 10²⁶ m.\n*   **Angular Size (θ):** The angular size is given as 10⁻¹⁷ degrees. We must convert this to radians for the formula:\n    θ_rad = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees * (π / 180) ≈ 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ radians.\n\nNow, we can calculate the diameter (D) of the event horizon:\nD ≈ (3.086 x 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹) ≈ 5.386 x 10⁷ m.\n\nThe radius of the event horizon (Schwarzschild radius, Rₛ) is half of the diameter:\nRₛ = D / 2 ≈ 2.693 x 10⁷ m.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Event Horizon's Area\n\nThe area of the event horizon (A) is the surface area of a sphere with radius Rₛ:\nA = 4 * π * Rₛ²\nA ≈ 4 * π * (2.693 x 10⁷ m)² ≈ 9.113 x 10¹⁵ m².\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Black Hole's Entropy\n\nThe entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. This formula relates the entropy (S) to the area of the event horizon (A), the Boltzmann constant (kₑ), the speed of light (c), the gravitational constant (G), and the reduced Planck constant (ħ). An equivalent and simpler form uses the Planck length (lₚ).\n\nThe formula is: S = (kₑ * A) / (4 * lₚ²)\n\nFirst, we need the value of the squared Planck length (lₚ²), which is defined as lₚ² = (ħG) / c³.\n\n*   Boltzmann constant (kₑ) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n*   Planck length (lₚ)² ≈ 2.612 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m².\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the entropy formula:\nS ≈ (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K * 9.113 x 10¹⁵ m²) / (4 * 2.612 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m²)\nS ≈ (1.259 x 10⁻⁷ J/K·m²) / (1.045 x 10⁻⁶⁹ m²)\nS ≈ 1.205 x 10⁶² J/K\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 1.205 x 10⁶² J/K. The order of magnitude is therefore 10⁶².\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 10⁶⁵ J/K\nB) 10⁶² J/K\nC) 10⁵⁹ J/K\nD) 10⁶⁶ J/K\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
