    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach the shape of a circle with radius `a` as the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central spot, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings, or minima, occur at specific angles where destructive interference is complete.\n\nThe angular position `θ` of these minima is determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, denoted as `J₁(x)`. The condition for a minimum is given by:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ) = zₘ`\n\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, equal to `2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the monochromatic light.\n*   `zₘ` is the *m*-th zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ), the equation simplifies to:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = zₘ`\n\nwhich gives the angular position of the *m*-th minimum as:\n\n`θₘ = (zₘ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two non-trivial zeros of the `J₁(x)` function. These values are approximately:\n*   First zero (`z₁`) ≈ 3.832\n*   Second zero (`z₂`) ≈ 7.016\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first (`θ₁`) and second (`θ₂`) minima:\n\n*   `θ₁ = (3.832 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (7.016 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.116 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between these two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`:\n\n`Δθ = (1.116 - 0.610) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = 0.506 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
