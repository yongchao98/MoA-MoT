    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of an object so that its Lyman-alpha absorption line can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider two key factors: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the atmospheric cutoff for ground-based observations.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength**: The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) spectral line corresponds to the electron transition in a hydrogen atom from the n=2 to the n=1 energy level. Its rest wavelength is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å), or 121.6 nanometers. This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff**: The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most ultraviolet radiation, primarily due to absorption by molecules like ozone. This atmospheric cutoff prevents UV light with wavelengths shorter than about 300-350 nanometers (3000-3500 Å) from reaching the ground. For a ground-based telescope to detect a signal, the signal's wavelength must be longer than this cutoff. Therefore, direct ground-based observations of phenomena like the Lyman-alpha transition are restricted to objects with a significant redshift. A practical limit for the \"optical window\" accessible from the ground is often taken as starting around 350 nm (3500 Å).\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation**: The redshift (z) describes how much the light from a distant object has been stretched to longer wavelengths. The formula is:\n\n    z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\n    To find the minimum redshift (z_min), we use the minimum observable wavelength (λ_observed_min) from the ground and the rest wavelength of the Lyα line (λ_rest):\n    *   λ_rest ≈ 1216 Å\n    *   λ_observed_min ≈ 3500 Å (a reasonable estimate for the start of the ground-based optical window)\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    z_min ≈ (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n    z_min ≈ 2.88 - 1\n    z_min ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 1.9. Therefore, a celestial object must have a redshift of at least ~1.9 for its Lyman-alpha absorption feature to be shifted into the visible spectrum and be detectable by ground-based optical telescopes. One study specifically mentions that direct ground-based observations of neutral hydrogen via the Lyman-alpha transition are restricted to redshifts of z ≳ 1.7. The value of 1.9 is consistent with this and other studies of high-redshift Lyman-alpha emitters.\n\n<<<D>>>"
