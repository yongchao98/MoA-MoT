    "To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to an observer in the laboratory, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The laboratory frame (S), where the observer is stationary.\n    *   The rest frame of the glass (S'), which is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory.\n\n2.  **Determine the speed of light in the glass (in its own rest frame):**\n    The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `u' = c/n`.\n    Since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, the speed of light within the glass, as measured in the glass's own frame (S'), is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities along the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + v*u'/c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (the glass) relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) relative to the moving frame (S').\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    We have:\n    *   `v = v` (the velocity of the glass)\n    *   `u' = 1/n` (the speed of light in the glass)\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v*(1/n)/1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option A. This effect, where the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the medium's speed and the speed of light within it, was famously observed in the Fizeau experiment.\n\n<<<A>>>"
