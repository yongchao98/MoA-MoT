    "### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom adds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product 1: 2-Bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide:** Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate followed by ring-opening, which results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring is converted into a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid functional group (after acidification, which is implicit in the workup).\n    *   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride in a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Pyridine is typically used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H):** This is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol. The bulky tert-butoxy groups moderate the reactivity of the hydride reagent, allowing for the selective formation of the aldehyde.\n    *   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.**\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine its structure for symmetry. The molecule consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nThe hydrogens can be categorized as follows:\n*   **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique and in a distinct chemical environment. (1 set)\n*   **The proton on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1):** This hydrogen (the alpha-proton) is also in a unique environment. (1 set)\n*   **The protons on the carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5):** Due to rapid ring-flipping at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond. This makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent; they are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. Therefore, the four hydrogens on these two carbons form two distinct sets. (2 sets)\n*   **The protons on the carbons furthest from the aldehyde group (C3 and C4):** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C4. Again, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This results in another two sets of distinct hydrogens. (2 sets)\n\nCounting the distinct sets:\n1.  Aldehyde H (1H)\n2.  C1 H (1H)\n3.  C2/C5 H (cis) (2H)\n4.  C2/C5 H (trans) (2H)\n5.  C3/C4 H (cis) (2H)\n6.  C3/C4 H (trans) (2H)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n<<<C>>>"
