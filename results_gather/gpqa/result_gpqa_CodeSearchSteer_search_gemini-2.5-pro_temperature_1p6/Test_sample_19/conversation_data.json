    "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a simplifying assumption that treats the interaction with a nucleus as a collection of interactions with individual, quasi-free nucleons. This approximation is valid under specific conditions related to the energy of the interaction and the nature of nuclear forces.\n\nThe core assumptions that collectively define the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is the foundational concept of the impulse approximation. The complex interaction with the many-body system is reduced to an incoherent sum of interactions with its constituent nucleons. The other (A-1) nucleons in the nucleus are considered spectators to the event.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption means that the particle interacting with the nucleon (for example, an electron) has a clear path to and from the nucleon in question, and the struck nucleon can leave the nucleus without any further interactions. This is often referred to as the neglect of final-state interactions (FSI).\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** During the brief moment of the high-energy interaction, the nucleon is treated as a free particle, unaffected by the potential energy that binds it within the nucleus. The timescale of the interaction is assumed to be much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus.\n\nThe third statement provided in the options, \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic,\" is not a standard assumption for the impulse approximation in nuclear physics. The impulse approximation treats nucleons as the fundamental interacting particles, and while the nucleon's own structure is relevant, the non-relativistic nature of its internal quarks is not a defining precondition for treating the *nucleon* as free during the interaction.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
