    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must verify two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility**: The star must be observable from both the Paranal Observatory in Chile (Southern Hemisphere) and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii (Northern Hemisphere).\n2.  **Brightness**: The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the limits of both instruments. Since HIRES has a stricter limit (< 16 mag) than ESPRESSO (< 17 mag), the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 16.\n\nThe location of the observatories are:\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO)**: Latitude approximately 24.6° S.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES)**: Latitude approximately 19.8° N.\n\nA star's visibility is determined by its declination (DEC). While the prompt asks to disregard pointing limits, a star must still rise above the horizon to be seen. A simplified rule is that a star is visible if its declination `δ` is greater than `latitude - 90°`.\n*   From Keck (+19.8° N), stars with declination > -70.2° are visible.\n*   From Paranal (-24.6° S), stars with declination < +65.4° are visible.\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M), distance (d) in parsecs, and absorption (A) using the formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10) + A`.\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Visibility**: DEC = -75°. This is below the -70.2° limit for Keck and is therefore **not visible** from the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion**: Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **Brightness**: Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the HIRES limit of < 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion**: Cannot be observed by HIRES.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **Brightness**: The apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the 16 mag limit for HIRES and the 17 mag limit for ESPRESSO.\n*   **Visibility**: DEC = +48°. This is within the observable range for both Keck (> -70.2°) and Paranal (< +65.4°).\n*   **Conclusion**: **Observable by both.**\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **Brightness**: We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Absorption (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   Apparent Magnitude (m_V) = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**.\n    *   This is fainter than the HIRES limit of < 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion**: Cannot be observed by HIRES.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Brightness**: We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_V) = 16.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n    *   Absorption (A_V) = 0 mag\n    *   Apparent Magnitude (m_V) = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.505 = **14.995 mag**.\n    *   This is brighter than the 16 mag limit for HIRES and the 17 mag limit for ESPRESSO.\n*   **Visibility**: DEC = +60°. This is within the observable range for both Keck (> -70.2°) and Paranal (< +65.4°).\n*   **Conclusion**: **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 can be detected by both spectrographs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
