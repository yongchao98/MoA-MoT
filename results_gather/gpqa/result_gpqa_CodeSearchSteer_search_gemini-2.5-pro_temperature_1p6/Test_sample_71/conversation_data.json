    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, 4, and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms it contains.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Diels-Alder reaction. First, the `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` reacts with sodium iodide. This reaction is a known method for generating highly reactive dienes in situ. While the starting material is complex, its role is to act as a precursor to a diene that can react with the norbornadiene derivative, which serves as the dienophile. A common and analogous reaction involves the debromination of 1,2-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene with NaI to form *o*-xylylene.\n*   The dienophile, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, has two double bonds. The use of two equivalents of the diene precursor implies that a Diels-Alder reaction occurs on both double bonds of the norbornadiene.\n*   **Product 1:** A symmetric molecule resulting from the double Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The exact structure of the diene is not essential for determining the final product, as it will be removed in a later step.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Mechanism:** The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) is an acid-labile protecting group for an alcohol. Aqueous acid catalyzes the cleavage of the tert-butyl ether to form an alcohol.\n*   **Product 2:** This product is identical to Product 1, but the 7-(tert-butoxy) group has been converted to a 7-hydroxy (-OH) group. The molecule remains symmetric.\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sulfur trioxide (SO₃) and pyridine in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n*   **Mechanism:** This set of reagents constitutes the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing alcohols. The secondary alcohol at position 7 is oxidized to a ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** This product is the 7-keto derivative of the double Diels-Alder adduct. It retains the overall symmetry of the preceding structures.\n\n### **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Mechanism:** Heating a Diels-Alder adduct often leads to a reverse reaction, known as a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This is entropically favored at higher temperatures.\n    1.  The heating of Product 3 causes it to fragment, releasing the two diene molecules used in Step 1 and regenerating the dienophile component, which is **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n    2.  Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is known to be thermally unstable. It can undergo further rearrangement. A plausible rearrangement pathway under these conditions is the isomerization to a more stable cyclopentadiene derivative. The most likely product is **5-formylcyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 5-formylcyclopentadiene.\n\n### **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\nThe structure of 5-formylcyclopentadiene consists of a five-membered ring with C=C double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4. The carbon at position 5 is sp³-hybridized and is attached to one hydrogen atom and one aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry:** 5-formylcyclopentadiene possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C5 carbon, its attached hydrogen, the aldehyde group, and bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n*   **Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  The **aldehyde proton** (-C**H**O) is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type, 1H)\n    2.  The **proton on C5** is also unique, being attached to the sp³ carbon of the ring. (1 type, 1H)\n    3.  The **protons on C1 and C4** are vinylic and are equivalent to each other due to the plane of symmetry. (1 type, 2H)\n    4.  The **protons on C2 and C3** are also vinylic and are equivalent to each other due to the same plane of symmetry. (1 type, 2H)\n\nCounting these distinct environments, we find there are a total of **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nA) 8\nB) 7\nC) 4\nD) 10\n\nThe correct answer is 4.\n<<<C>>>"
