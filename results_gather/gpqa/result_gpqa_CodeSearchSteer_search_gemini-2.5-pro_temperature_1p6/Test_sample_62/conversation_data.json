    "Here is a step-by-pystep derivation of the solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Model\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy of the molecule is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies.\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy:** `Ev = ħω(v + 1/2)`, where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **Rotational Energy:** `Er = B * J(J + 1)`, where `B = ħ² / (2I)` is the rotational constant, `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n*   **Total Energy:** The total energy of a rovibrational state (v, J) is `E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B * J(J + 1)`.\n\nThe molecule starts in its **fundamental (ground) state**, which is the lowest possible energy state, corresponding to `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\nThe molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. However, for a diatomic molecule absorbing a photon, specific selection rules apply.\n\n*   For a vibrational transition to occur, the vibrational quantum number must change by `Δv = +1`.\n*   Simultaneously, the rotational quantum number must change by `ΔJ = ±1`. A pure vibrational transition (`ΔJ = 0`) is typically forbidden for diatomic molecules.\n\nThe ground state is `(v=0, J=0)`. According to the selection rules, the only possible transition to the `v=1` state is to `(v=1, J=1)`, as `J` cannot decrease (`ΔJ = -1` is not possible). This is known as the R(0) transition in spectroscopy. Therefore, the transition is from the initial state `(v=0, J=0)` to the final state `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **Initial Energy `E_i`:** `E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n*   **Final Energy `E_f`:** `E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\nThe energy difference `ΔE` is:\n`ΔE = E_f - E_i = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + 2B`\n\nSince the rotational constant `B = ħ² / (2I)`, we can write `2B = ħ²/I`. So, `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`.\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\nWe now substitute the given values and physical constants to find the numerical value of `ΔE`.\n\n**Given:**\n*   `Mx = 20 amu`\n*   `My = 2 amu`\n*   `R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n*   `ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s`\n\n**Constants:**\n*   `ħ` (Reduced Planck Constant) ≈ `1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n*   `c` (Speed of Light) ≈ `3.00 x 10⁸ m/s`\n*   `1 amu` (Atomic Mass Unit) ≈ `1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n**Step 4a: Calculate the Reduced Mass (μ)**\nThe reduced mass `μ` is given by the formula `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n*   `μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n*   `μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n**Step 4b: Calculate the Moment of Inertia (I)**\nThe moment of inertia `I` is `I = μ * R²`.\n*   `I = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²`\n*   `I = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) = 1.2072 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n**Step 4c: Calculate the Energy Terms**\n*   Vibrational term: `ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n*   Rotational term: `ħ²/I = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2072 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n**Step 4d: Calculate Total Transition Energy (ΔE)**\n*   `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J`\n*   `ΔE ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.009 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\n### 5. Calculating Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy and momentum of a photon are related by the formula `E = pc`, which can be rearranged to `p = E / c`.\n\n*   `p = ΔE / c = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)`\n*   `p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\nThis value is very close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
