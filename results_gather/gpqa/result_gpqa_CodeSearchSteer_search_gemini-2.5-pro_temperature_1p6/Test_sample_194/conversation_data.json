    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum orbital distance (and thus period) for the second planet where it can still pass in front of and behind the star from our line of sight.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Geometry\n\n*   A **transit** occurs when a planet passes in front of its star.\n*   An **occultation** (or secondary eclipse) is when the planet passes behind its star.\n*   For both events to happen, the planet's orbit must be aligned such that at its closest approach to the star's line of sight (in the sky's projection), its disk overlaps with the star's disk.\n*   This limiting condition occurs when the edge of the planet's disk grazes the edge of the star's disk. At this point, the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star is equal to the sum of their radii (`R_s + R_p`).\n*   The projected distance of a planet from its star's center is given by `a * cos(i)`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit and `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to the plane of the sky (with `i` = 90° being perfectly edge-on).\n\n### 2. Using Planet 1 to Find the Orbital Inclination\n\nWe can use the information from the first planet to find the system's orbital inclination (`i`), which is assumed to be the same for the second planet.\n\n*   The impact parameter (`b`) is the projected distance at mid-transit, normalized by the star's radius: `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`.\n*   For Planet 1, we have: `a_1 * cos(i) = b_1 * R_s`.\n    *   `b_1` = 0.2\n    *   `R_s` = 1.5 Solar radii\n\n### 3. Finding the Maximum Orbit for Planet 2\n\nFor Planet 2, the maximum semi-major axis (`a_2_max`) that allows for a transit/occultation is when its maximum projected separation equals the sum of its radius and the star's radius.\n\n*   Condition for Planet 2: `a_2_max * cos(i) = R_s + R_p2`.\n    *   `R_p2` = 2.5 Earth radii\n\n### 4. Combining the Equations and Using Kepler's Law\n\nNow we can relate the two planets' orbits. By dividing the equation for Planet 2 by the equation for Planet 1, we get:\n\n`(a_2_max * cos(i)) / (a_1 * cos(i)) = (R_s + R_p2) / (b_1 * R_s)`\n\n`a_2_max / a_1 = (1 + R_p2 / R_s) / b_1`\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, the ratio of the semi-major axes is related to the ratio of the orbital periods (`P`):\n\n`(a_2 / a_1) = (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)`\n\nSubstituting this into our combined equation gives:\n\n`(P_2_max / P_1)^(2/3) = (1 + R_p2 / R_s) / b_1`\n\nFinally, we can solve for the maximum period of Planet 2 (`P_2_max`):\n\n`P_2_max = P_1 * [ (1 + R_p2 / R_s) / b_1 ]^(3/2)`\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\nFirst, let's calculate the ratio of Planet 2's radius to the star's radius:\n*   Solar radius (`R_sun`) ≈ 696,000 km.\n*   Earth radius (`R_earth`) ≈ 6,371 km.\n*   Star radius (`R_s`) = 1.5 * `R_sun` = 1.5 * 696,000 km = 1,044,000 km.\n*   Planet 2 radius (`R_p2`) = 2.5 * `R_earth` = 2.5 * 6,371 km = 15,927.5 km.\n*   `R_p2 / R_s` = 15,927.5 / 1,044,000 ≈ 0.01526.\n\nNow, plug all the values into the final equation:\n*   `P_1` = 3 days\n*   `b_1` = 0.2\n*   `P_2_max` = 3 * [ (1 + 0.01526) / 0.2 ]^(3/2)\n*   `P_2_max` = 3 * [ 1.01526 / 0.2 ]^(3/2)\n*   `P_2_max` = 3 * [ 5.0763 ]^(3/2)\n*   `P_2_max` = 3 * 11.41\n*   `P_2_max` ≈ 34.23 days\n\nThis result is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
