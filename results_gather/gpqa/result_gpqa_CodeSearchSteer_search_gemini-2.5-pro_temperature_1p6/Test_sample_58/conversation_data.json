    "To determine the pH of the final solution, a step-by-step stoichiometric calculation is required. This involves calculating the initial moles of each reactant, identifying the neutralization reactions that occur, and then calculating the pH based on the final composition of the solution.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to produce two OH⁻ ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Neutralization of Strong Acid and Strong Base:**\n\nThe H⁺ ions from the strong acid (HCl) will first react with the OH⁻ ions from the strong base (Ba(OH)₂) in a neutralization reaction.\n\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) = 0.180 mol\n*   The reaction is: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   Since there are more moles of OH⁻, all the H⁺ from HCl will be consumed.\n*   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n**3. Reaction of Excess Strong Base with Weak Acid:**\n\nThe remaining 0.100 moles of the strong base (OH⁻) will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.100 mol\n*   The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   In this step, the CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**4. Calculate the Final pH:**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻, a strong base. The presence of this excess strong base will primarily determine the pH of the solution.\n\n*   **Total Volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Concentration of remaining OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of remaining OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
