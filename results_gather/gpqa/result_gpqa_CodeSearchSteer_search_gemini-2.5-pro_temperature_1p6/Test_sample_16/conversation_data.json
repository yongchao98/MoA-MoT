    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe stability constant (K_f), also called the formation constant, for this reaction is given as:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n\nThe problem starts with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. This complex will dissociate slightly back into its constituent ions:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nLet 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ complex at equilibrium will be its initial concentration minus the amount that has dissociated, which is 0.02 - x.\n\nSo, at equilibrium, we have:\n*   [Ca²⁺] = x\n*   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n*   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the stability constant expression:\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation of the complex is minimal. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can simplify the expression by approximating (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is x, which is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nB) 1.0x10⁻² M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
