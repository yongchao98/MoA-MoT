    "The detailed calculation confirms my initial reasoning. The search results provide the foundational formulas and confirm the relationships used.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The search results confirm that for a planet heated only by its star, the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is calculated by balancing the absorbed stellar energy with the energy radiated by the planet. The formula shows that T_eq is proportional to the inverse square root of the semi-major axis (a), assuming other factors like albedo and stellar properties are constant.\n    *   `T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This can be written as P² ∝ a³, which means P is proportional to a^(3/2).\n\nThe steps to solve the problem are as follows:\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of the semi-major axes.**\n    The relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis is `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures between two planets (i and j) is:\n    `T_eq(i) / T_eq(j) = √[a(j) / a(i)]`\n    Squaring this gives:\n    `[T_eq(i) / T_eq(j)]² = a(j) / a(i)`\n\n    Applying this to the given values:\n    *   For Planet 1 and Planet 2: `[T_eq(1) / T_eq(2)]² = a(2) / a(1)`. Given `T_eq(1) / T_eq(2) ≈ 1.4`, we have `a(2) / a(1) = 1.4² = 1.96`.\n    *   For Planet 2 and Planet 3: `[T_eq(2) / T_eq(3)]² = a(3) / a(2)`. Given `T_eq(2) / T_eq(3) ≈ 2.3`, we have `a(3) / a(2) = 2.3² = 5.29`.\n\n    To find the ratio of the semi-major axis of Planet 3 to Planet 1, `a(3) / a(1)`, we multiply the two ratios:\n    `a(3) / a(1) = [a(3) / a(2)] * [a(2) / a(1)] = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`\n\n2.  **Find the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    According to Kepler's Third Law, the relationship between orbital period (P) and semi-major axis (a) is `P² ∝ a³` or `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 and Planet 1 is:\n    `P(3) / P(1) = [a(3) / a(1)]^(3/2)`\n\n    Using the value calculated in the first step:\n    `P(3) / P(1) = (10.3684)^(3/2)`\n    `P(3) / P(1) ≈ 33.399`\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planet masses and the specific albedo value is not required for the calculation as they either do not factor into this specific relationship or cancel out.\n\nComparing the result with the given options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
