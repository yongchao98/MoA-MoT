    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Normalize the initial state vector:**\n    The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)ᵀ.\n    First, we need to normalize this state vector. The norm squared is:\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n    The normalized state vector, |ψ_norm⟩, is:\n    |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)ᵀ\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0:**\n    The operator for P is given by the matrix:\n    P =\n    [ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]\n    [ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]\n    [ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]\n\n    We need to find the eigenvector |p=0⟩ such that P|p=0⟩ = 0|p=0⟩ = 0.\n    Let |p=0⟩ = (x, y, z)ᵀ.\n    [ 0, 1/√2, 0 ] [x]  \n    [ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ] [y] =\n    [ 0, 1/√2, 0 ] [z]  \n\n    This gives us the equations:\n    (1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0\n    (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n\n    The eigenvector is of the form (x, 0, -x). We normalize it:\n    x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1 => 2x² = 1 => x = 1/√2.\n    So, the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is |p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)ᵀ.\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of measuring P = 0:**\n    The probability is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvector |p=0⟩.\n    Prob(P=0) = |⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩|²\n    The inner product ⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩ is:\n    ⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [ (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1) ] * [ (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)ᵀ ]\n    = (1/√12) * [ 1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ]\n    = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3.\n\n    The probability is:\n    Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3.\n\n4.  **Determine the state of the system after the first measurement:**\n    After measuring P and getting the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector, |p=0⟩.\n    The new state of the system, |ψ'⟩, is:\n    |ψ'⟩ = |p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)ᵀ.\n\n5.  **Find the eigenvector of Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1:**\n    The operator for Q is the diagonal matrix:\n    Q =\n    [ 1, 0, 0 ]\n    [ 0, 0, 0 ]\n    [ 0, 0, -1 ]\n\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue -1 is |q=-1⟩ = (0, 0, 1)ᵀ.\n\n6.  **Calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1:**\n    This measurement is performed on the new state |ψ'⟩. The probability is the square of the magnitude of the projection of |ψ'⟩ onto the eigenvector |q=-1⟩.\n    Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩|²\n    The inner product ⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩ is:\n    ⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [ (0, 0, 1) ] * [ (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)ᵀ ]\n    = (1/√2) * [ 0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1) ]\n    = -1/√2.\n\n    The probability is:\n    Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2.\n\n7.  **Calculate the total probability:**\n    The probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the sequence.\n    Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)\n    Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
