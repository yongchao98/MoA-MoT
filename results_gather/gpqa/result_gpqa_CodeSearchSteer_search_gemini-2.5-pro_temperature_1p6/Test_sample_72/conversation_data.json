    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n### 1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let `u` be the speed of the first astronaut (0.6c) and `v` be the speed of the second astronaut (0.5c). The formula for the relative speed `v_rel` is:\n\n`v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v) / c^2)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n*   `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n*   `v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The formula for the total energy of a particle is `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, given by `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (`m1`) = 2m\n*   Speed (`v1`) = 0.6c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ1`):\n    *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n    *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n    *   `γ1 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Next, calculate the energy (`E1`):\n    *   `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2`\n    *   `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n    *   `E1 = 2.5mc^2`\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (`m2`) = 3m\n*   Speed (`v2`) = 0.5c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ2`):\n    *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n    *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n    *   `γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866 = 1.1547`\n*   Next, calculate the energy (`E2`):\n    *   `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n    *   `E2 = 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2`\n    *   `E2 ≈ 3.464mc^2`\n\n**Total System Energy:**\n*   The total energy `E` is the sum of `E1` and `E2`:\n    *   `E = E1 + E2`\n    *   `E = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2`\n    *   `E = 5.964mc^2`\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96mc^2**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately `0.14c`, and the total energy is `5.96mc^2`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
