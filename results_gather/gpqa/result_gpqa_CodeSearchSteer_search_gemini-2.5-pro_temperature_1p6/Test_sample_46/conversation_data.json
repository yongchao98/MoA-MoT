    "The provided data is used to identify the correct chemical structure for the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as follows:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\nA degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. IR Spectroscopy:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is indicative of an ester C=O stretch. Amide carbonyls typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H):** This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to a deshielding atom, which in this context is an oxygen atom. This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and potential hydrogen exchange. The IR data supports the presence of this primary amine.\n*   **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two doublets, each integrating to two protons, show that the ring has two different substituents. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Structures\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This molecule is an amide, which is inconsistent with the ester C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum. Its ¹H NMR would show a formyl proton (CHO) signal, which is not observed.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the collected data. It has the correct formula (C9H11NO2), a primary amine (-NH2), an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. The predicted spectral data aligns with the experimental values provided.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, inconsistent with the IR C=O frequency. Furthermore, as a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) compound, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The ethyl group in the propionate moiety (CH3CH2CO-) would show a quartet around 2.2-2.5 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. Also, the C=O of a phenyl ester would typically appear at a higher frequency than observed.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the IR and ¹H NMR spectra, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
