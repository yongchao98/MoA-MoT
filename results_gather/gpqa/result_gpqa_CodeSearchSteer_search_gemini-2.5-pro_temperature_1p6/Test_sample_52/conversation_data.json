    "The analysis of the provided spectroscopic data allows for a step-by-step deduction of the unknown compound's structure and, consequently, its chemical formula.\n\n### Spectroscopic Analysis:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This indicates the presence of a C6H4 group in the molecule.\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The absorption peaks indicating an ester group confirm the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   **No –CH2 groups**: This is a critical piece of information that rules out many possibilities, such as ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or allyl groups (-CH2CH=CH2).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups**: This points to the existence of two distinct methyl groups.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, –CH=CH–CH3. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring would be split into a doublet by its vinyl neighbor. The other vinyl proton would be split by both the first vinyl proton and the three protons of the methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n4.  **Assembling the Structure**:\n    *   The vinyl and methyl signals strongly suggest a **propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3)** as one of the substituents on the aromatic ring. This accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n    *   The ester group and the second methyl signal can be explained by a **methyl ester group (–COOCH3)**. This structure contains a methyl group and importantly, no –CH2– groups.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a methyl propenylbenzoate, with a propenyl group and a methyl ester group attached to a benzene ring.\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula:\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of atoms for the proposed structure of methyl propenylbenzoate:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 from the benzene ring (C6H4) + 1 from the carbonyl (C=O) + 1 from the methoxy group (–OCH3) + 3 from the propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 from the benzene ring (C6H4) + 3 from the methoxy group (–OCH3) + 5 from the propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 from the ester group (–COO–) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This is consistent with compounds having an aromatic ring, an ester, and vinyl and methyl groups.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2**: Matches the derived formula.\n*   **B) C12H14O2**: This formula would require an additional CH2, but the NMR spectrum shows no –CH2– groups.\n*   **C) C12H12O2**: To have this formula while fitting the other criteria is not possible. For instance, adding a carbon would likely introduce groups (like CH2) that are contradicted by the NMR, or it would require altering the substitution pattern.\n*   **D) C11H14O2**: This formula has a lower degree of unsaturation, which would mean it couldn't contain both a benzene ring and a vinyl group, contradicting the NMR data.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectral data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
