  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the relationship between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Data Analysis\n\n1.  **Single Mutants (g1, g2, g3):**\n    *   Wild-type (Control) has 100% resistance.\n    *   `g1` has 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function causes a 25% drop in resistance.\n    *   `g2` has 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely abolishes resistance. This indicates G2 plays an essential role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   `g3` has 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function causes a 50% drop in resistance.\n\n2.  **Double Mutants (g1g2, g2g3, g1g3):**\n    *   `g1g2` has 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant. When a double mutant exhibits the phenotype of one of the single mutants, that gene is said to be **epistatic** to the other. Therefore, G2 is epistatic to G1.\n    *   `g2g3` has 0% resistance. This phenotype is also identical to the `g2` single mutant. Therefore, G2 is also epistatic to G3.\n    *   `g1g3` has 10% resistance. The individual losses of resistance for g1 and g3 are 25% and 50%, respectively. If their effects were simply additive, the expected resistance would be 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%. The actual resistance is 10%, which is significantly lower. This indicates a **synergistic interaction** between G1 and G3, where the combined loss of both genes has a greater effect than the sum of their individual effects.\n\n### Interpretation and Conclusion\n\n*   **Identifying the Transcription Factor:** The prompt states at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. Epistasis reveals the order of genes in a pathway. Since the `g2` mutant phenotype (0% resistance) masks the phenotypes of both `g1` and `g3`, G2 must act upstream of both G1 and G3. A common regulatory mechanism is a transcription factor (upstream gene) controlling the expression of target genes (downstream genes). Therefore, **G2 is the most likely candidate for the transcription factor.**\n\n*   **Relationship between G1 and G3:** G1 and G3 have a synergistic interaction, meaning they likely function in two separate, parallel pathways downstream of G2 that both contribute to the overall resistance. Loss of both pathways is more detrimental than would be expected from losing each one individually.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on our conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: This aligns with our findings.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a plausible, though not proven, explanation for how the transcription factor G2 could regulate both genes. It is consistent with our model.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: This statement is technically incorrect; the interaction is synergy, not epistasis. However, given that all options may have flaws, this might be considered the \"best fit\". One could argue that G3 has a stronger effect than G1 (50% vs 25% resistance loss), making it the dominant component in a loose sense.\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: This is incorrect. The data clearly shows G2 is upstream of G1, not the other way around.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: This is incorrect. The g1g3 double mutant has a much more severe phenotype (10% resistance) than either single mutant. This is synergy, the opposite of redundancy.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measured one trait (disease resistance), so there is no evidence to support this claim.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This is incorrect, as the interaction is synergistic.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nComparing the options, Option A contains the most accurate and plausible statements. It correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor based on epistasis data and suggests a reasonable (though unproven) mechanism of co-regulation. Its only significant flaw is mislabeling the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 as epistasis. The other options contain more definitive errors, such as misidentifying the transcription factor (B) or making claims that directly contradict the data (C).\n\n<<<A>>>"
