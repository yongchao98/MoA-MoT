    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the factor by which the ratio of atomic populations changes.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Core Principle: The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe problem requires comparing the population of two atomic energy levels at different temperatures. In a stellar photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy states is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N_upper) to a lower energy level (N_lower) is given by:\n\nN_upper / N_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels (E_upper - E_lower).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n*   `g_upper` and `g_lower` are the statistical weights of the levels, which are constant for the given levels.\n\n### 2. Interpreting the Problem Statement\n\nThe problem states that \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) ... decreases when the star has spots.\" Spots make the star cooler.\n\nLet's analyze the formula: as temperature `T` decreases, the term `-ΔE / (kT)` becomes more negative (since `ΔE`, `k` are positive). This causes the exponential term `exp(-ΔE / kT)` to decrease. Therefore, the ratio `N_upper / N_lower` decreases as the temperature drops.\n\nThis perfectly matches the observation. We can thus conclude that the ratio mentioned in the problem corresponds to `N_upper / N_lower`, with \"level 1\" being the upper energy level and \"level 2\" being the lower one.\n\nThe temperatures to be compared are:\n*   `T_nospots` = 6000 K (the star's surface without spots)\n*   `T_spots` = 5500 K (the overall effective temperature when spots are present)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy difference `ΔE` can be calculated from the wavelength (λ) of the transition using the Planck-Einstein relation, `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n\nGiven:\n*   λ = 1448 Å = 1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m\n*   h (Planck's constant) = 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c (speed of light) = 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s\n\nCalculation:\n`ΔE = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s × 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s) / (1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m)`\n`ΔE ≈ 1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Factor\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This can be expressed as:\n\nFactor = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots\n\nLet `R(T)` be the population ratio at temperature `T`.\n`R(T) = (g₁/g₂) * exp(-ΔE / (kT))`\n\nFactor = `R(T_nospots) / R(T_spots)`\nFactor = `[(g₁/g₂) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))] / [(g₁/g₂) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))]`\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g₁/g₂)` cancels out:\nFactor = `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\nFactor = `exp[(-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)]`\n\nNow, substitute the values:\n*   `T_nospots` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spots` = 5500 K\n*   `ΔE` ≈ 1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J\n*   `k` = 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nLet's first calculate the `ΔE/k` term:\n`ΔE/k ≈ (1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99421 K`\n\nNow plug this into the factor equation:\nFactor = `exp[-99421 * (1/6000 - 1/5500)]`\nFactor = `exp[-99421 * ( (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) )]`\nFactor = `exp[-99421 * (-500 / 33,000,000)]`\nFactor = `exp[-99421 * (-1.515 × 10⁻⁵)]`\nFactor = `exp[1.506]`\nFactor ≈ 4.51\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
