    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe survival of unstable particles is governed by an exponential decay law. For a particle moving at relativistic speeds, its internal clock slows down relative to an observer in the laboratory. This phenomenon is called time dilation and is described by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nThe fraction of particles, *f*, that survive after traveling a distance *R* at a velocity *v* is given by the formula:\n\n*f* = exp( -t / (γ * τ) )\n\nWhere:\n*   **t** is the time of flight in the lab frame (t ≈ R/c for ultra-relativistic particles, where c is the speed of light).\n*   **τ** (tau) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n*   **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which accounts for time dilation.\n\nCombining these, the survival fraction is:\n\n*f* = exp( -R / (γ * cτ) )\n\n### **2. Analyze the Initial Situation**\n\nIn the first scenario, we are given:\n*   Detector radius (R) = 30 m\n*   Initial Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector (f₁) = 1/3\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30 / (20 * cτ) )\n\nTo simplify, let's take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)\nln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)\n\nThis equation relates the known quantities to the unknown proper lifetime of the particle (τ).\n\n### **3. Set Up the Second Scenario**\n\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that allows a different fraction of particles to reach the detector:\n*   Detector radius (R) = 30 m (this remains the same)\n*   New fraction of particles (f₂) = 2/3\n*   New Lorentz factor (γ₂) = ?\n\nUsing the same survival equation:\n\n2/3 = exp( -30 / (γ₂ * cτ) )\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n### **4. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1.  ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)\n2.  ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express the constant term `cτ`:\ncτ = 1.5 / ln(3)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for `cτ` into equation (2):\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * [1.5 / ln(3)])\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for γ₂:\nln(3/2) = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * γ₂)\nln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\n### **5. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\nNow, calculate γ₂:\nγ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
