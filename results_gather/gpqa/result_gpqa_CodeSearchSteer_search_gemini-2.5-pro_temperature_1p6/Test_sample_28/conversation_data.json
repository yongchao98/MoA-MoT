    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, it is necessary to inactivate the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is best achieved by creating a \"knockout\" or \"loss-of-function\" mutation. When analyzing the provided mutants, it's crucial to identify the mutation most likely to completely disrupt the protein's function.\n\nThere are several types of mutations to consider:\n*   **Missense Mutation**: A change in a single DNA base pair that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the final protein. The effect can be minor or it can alter protein function, but it doesn't guarantee inactivation.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation**: This occurs when nucleotides are inserted or deleted in a number that is not a multiple of three. This alters the gene's reading frame, changing all subsequent amino acids and often resulting in a premature, non-functional protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation**: This is a change in the DNA sequence that results in a premature \"stop\" codon (such as TAA, TAG, or TGA). This mutation signals the cell to stop protein synthesis, leading to a shortened and typically non-functional protein. A nonsense mutation is one of the most effective ways to achieve a gene knockout.\n\nAnalyzing the provided options:\n\n*   **Intact gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` The first three codons are Methionine (start), Phenylalanine, and Leucine.\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...` This sequence contains a missense mutation where the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This might not be enough to completely eliminate the protein's function.\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...` This sequence is the most significant. The third codon, `CTC` in the original gene, has been altered to become `TAA`. **TAA is a stop codon**. This is a nonsense mutation that will cause protein translation to halt very early, producing only a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (Methionine-Phenylalanine). This resulting truncated protein is almost certain to be non-functional, thus eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...` (after aligning with the intact sequence) This appears to contain a missense mutation, changing `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), similar to Mutant 4. This change may or may not eliminate function.\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...` This sequence also contains a missense mutation, changing `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). Like the other missense mutations, its effect on protein function is not guaranteed.\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2, which introduces a premature stop codon, is the most likely to cause a complete loss of gene function and therefore eliminate the unwanted compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
