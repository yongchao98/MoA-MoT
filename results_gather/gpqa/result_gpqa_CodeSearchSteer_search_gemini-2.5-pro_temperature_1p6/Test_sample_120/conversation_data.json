    "The reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), is a cornerstone of organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. This reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereochemistry of the product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and Me₂CuLi:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Reactants:**\n    *   **The Epoxide:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic molecule where an epoxide ring is fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring. The epoxide connects carbons C1 and C6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **The Nucleophile:** The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), a Gilman reagent. In this reagent, a methyl group (Me) acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Determining the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The prompt and general principles of epoxide ring-opening reactions under basic or nucleophilic conditions state that the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide.\n    *   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is not substituted with a methyl group (it is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and two other carbons).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less hindered carbon, and the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack at this position.\n\n3.  **Determining the Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction follows an Sₙ2 pathway, which involves a backside attack by the nucleophile. This results in an *inversion of configuration* at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n    *   The initial configuration at the attacked carbon, C6, is given as (S).\n    *   Due to the Sₙ2 inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will become (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly attacked and thus remain unchanged. The C1-O bond breaks during the ring-opening, but the tetrahedral arrangement of substituents around C1 is maintained, preserving its (R) configuration. The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are remote from the reaction site and are unaffected.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Final Product:**\n    *   The reaction opens the epoxide to form a cyclohexanol. A new methyl group is added at the original C6 position, and a hydroxyl (-OH) group is formed at the original C1 position after an acidic workup.\n    *   The resulting molecule contains four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a cyclohexane ring. According to IUPAC nomenclature, this product is named 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n    *   The stereochemistry of the final product is determined by the configurations retained and inverted during the reaction:\n        *   The C1 center (now bearing the -OH group) retains its (R) configuration.\n        *   The C6 center (now C2 in the product, bearing the new methyl group) inverts from (S) to (R).\n        *   The C4 center retains its (R) configuration.\n        *   The C3 center (now C5 in the product) retains its (R) configuration.\n\nCombining these pieces, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
