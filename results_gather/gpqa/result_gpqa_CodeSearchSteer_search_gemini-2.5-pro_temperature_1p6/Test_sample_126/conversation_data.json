    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a type of chemical reaction known as a Cope rearrangement. This reaction is a-sigmatropic rearrangement characteristic of 1,5-dienes. The process is concerted, meaning the bond breaking and bond formation occur in a single step through a cyclic transition state.\n\nTo determine the resulting molecule, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Molecule**: 5-butylnona-2,6-diene has a 9-carbon main chain (nonane) with a butyl group at position 5 and double bonds starting at positions 2 and 6. Its structure is:\n    `CH₃–CH=CH–CH₂–CH(C₄H₉)–CH=CH–CH₂–CH₃`\n\n2.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement**: The core of the molecule, a 1,5-diene system, includes carbons 2 through 7 (`C²=C³–C⁴–C⁵–C⁶=C⁷`). In the rearrangement:\n    *   The single bond between C⁴ and C⁵ breaks.\n    *   A new single bond forms between C² and C⁷.\n    *   The double bond at C²=C³ shifts to C³=C⁴.\n    *   The double bond at C⁶=C⁷ shifts to C⁵=C⁶.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure**: Let's trace the connectivity of the carbon skeleton after the rearrangement.\n    *   The original C⁴ (`-CH₂-`) becomes a terminal methylene group (`=CH₂`).\n    *   The original C² (`-CH(CH₃)-`) and C⁷ (`-CH(CH₂CH₃)-`) are now linked.\n    *   The original C⁵ (`-CH(C₄H₉)-`) is now part of a double bond.\n\n    Assembling these pieces gives the following structure for the product:\n    `CH₂=CH–CH(CH₃)–CH(CH₂CH₃)–CH=CH(C₄H₉)`\n    This can be expanded to:\n    `CH₂=CH–CH(CH₃)–CH(CH₂CH₃)–CH=CH–CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n\n4.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature)**: To name this new molecule, we must find the longest carbon chain that contains both double bonds.\n    *   Tracing the carbon chain from the terminal `=CH₂` on the left to the terminal `–CH₃` of the butyl-derived group on the right reveals a continuous chain of 10 carbons.\n    *   This makes the parent chain a **deca-diene**.\n    *   To assign the lowest possible numbers (locants) to the double bonds, we number the chain from the left. This places the double bonds starting at carbons 1 and 5. Thus, it is a **deca-1,5-diene**.\n    *   Now, we identify and locate the substituents on this chain. There is a methyl group (`-CH₃`) on carbon 3 and an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) on carbon 4.\n    *   Listing the substituents alphabetically gives the final name: **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\nThis name corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
