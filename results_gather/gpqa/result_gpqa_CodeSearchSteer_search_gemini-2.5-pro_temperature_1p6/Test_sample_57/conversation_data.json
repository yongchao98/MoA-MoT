    "In physics, regularization is a technique used to manage infinities that arise in calculations, particularly within quantum field theories. These infinities, or divergences, typically occur at high-energy (or, equivalently, short-distance) scales.\n\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force, QCD requires regularization to handle the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that appear in calculations. Methods like lattice regularization are employed to make the theory mathematically tractable.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, while not a quantum field theory, suffers from its own high-energy problem related to the concept of a point-like electron. The self-energy of a classical point charge is infinite, indicating a breakdown of the theory at very small distances. This instability is known as the \"4/3 problem\". While the terminology of regularization is most formally associated with the loop diagrams of quantum field theory, classical electrodynamics is not free from high-energy pathologies.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED, the quantum theory of electromagnetism, was one of the first theories where the need for regularization and the subsequent process of renormalization became essential. Like QCD, it is a quantum field theory that produces infinities in its calculations which must be managed through regularization.\n\n*   **C) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is its potential to be a quantum theory of gravity that is free of ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. By postulating that fundamental particles are not point-like but rather one-dimensional \"strings,\" the theory smooths out the interactions that lead to infinities in quantum field theories. It is widely believed that superstring theory is ultraviolet-finite, meaning it does not require a regularization procedure for high energies.\n\nBased on this, Superstring Theory is the framework that claims to not need regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<C>>>"
