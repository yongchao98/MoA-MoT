    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. NaNH2 is a very strong base that can deprotonate the benzene ring.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) from NaNH₂ acts as a strong base and removes a hydrogen (or deuterium) from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the one bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nSince a C-H bond is weaker than a C-D bond, the removal of the proton from C6 is kinetically favored. However, both pathways are possible and lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes a proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. This intermediate, **3-deutero-benzyne**, still contains the deuterium atom at position 2.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. This intermediate is **benzyne** and does not contain deuterium.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of the Nucleophile**\n\nThe highly reactive benzyne intermediates then undergo nucleophilic attack by the amide ion (NH₂⁻). The attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond.\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deutero-benzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   If NH₂⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent to yield **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1, which upon protonation yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne.\n    *   Regardless of which carbon is attacked, subsequent protonation by the solvent yields the same product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBecause both elimination pathways are possible, three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
