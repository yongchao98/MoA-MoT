    "To determine which statement is true about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation, we must examine its underlying assumptions.\n\nThe Mott-Gurney law is a foundational model for describing space-charge-limited current (SCLC). Its derivation rests on several key idealizations about the material and the device structure:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is injected and transported through the semiconductor. This is why SCLC measurements are often performed on \"electron-only\" or \"hole-only\" devices.\n*   **Trap-Free Material:** The ideal Mott-Gurney law applies to a semiconductor with no charge traps (localized energy states within the bandgap). In real materials, traps can capture and immobilize charge carriers, significantly altering the current-voltage relationship.\n*   **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** For the current to be limited by the buildup of space charge in the bulk of the material, the injecting contact must be \"Ohmic.\" This means the contact can supply an abundance of carriers and presents no significant energy barrier to their injection into the semiconductor. A non-Ohmic, or Schottky, contact would limit the current by its injection properties rather than the bulk space charge.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The model assumes that the current is dominated by the drift of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The contribution from diffusion current, which arises from carrier concentration gradients, is considered negligible.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on these assumptions:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact creates an injection barrier, which violates a core assumption. An Ohmic contact is required.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect. The SCLC is fundamentally a drift-driven current; the assumption is that *diffusion* current is negligible, not drift current.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly combines the key assumptions: it specifies a single-carrier device that is trap-free, has a contact with no injection barrier (which is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact), and has negligible diffusion current.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is a single-carrier model. The presence of a second carrier type would introduce recombination, which is not accounted for in the equation.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that accurately describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
