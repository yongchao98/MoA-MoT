    "The treatment of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a known method for the synthesis of α-diketones (1,2-diketones). The reaction proceeds by converting the ketone to its enol or enolate form, which then reacts with the nitrosonium ion (NO+) generated from NaNO2 and HCl. This initially forms an α-nitroso ketone, which tautomerizes to an α-keto oxime. Subsequent hydrolysis under the acidic conditions yields the final 1,2-diketone product.\n\n**Reaction A: Synthesis of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\n\nThe starting material A is treated with NaNO2, HCl, and H2O to produce 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. Based on the reaction mechanism, the starting material must be a ketone that can be oxidized at the carbon atom adjacent (the α-carbon) to the existing carbonyl group. The logical precursor is therefore 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one. The reaction introduces a second carbonyl group at the C-2 position.\n\n**Reaction B: Synthesis of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\n\nSimilarly, the starting material B reacts with the same reagents to yield 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. This product is an α-diketone. The reaction starts with a ketone and introduces a carbonyl group at the adjacent α-carbon. The appropriate starting material is 5-methylhexan-2-one. In this case, the existing carbonyl is at the C-2 position, and the reaction oxidizes the methylene group at the C-3 position.\n\nTherefore, starting material A is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, and starting material B is 5-methylhexan-2-one. This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n*   A diol (5-methylhexane-2,3-diol in options A and C) would not produce a diketone under these specific reaction conditions.\n*   An ether alcohol (4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol in options B and C) is not the direct precursor for this type of α-diketone synthesis.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that both reactions involve the oxidation of an α-methylene group of a ketone to a carbonyl group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
