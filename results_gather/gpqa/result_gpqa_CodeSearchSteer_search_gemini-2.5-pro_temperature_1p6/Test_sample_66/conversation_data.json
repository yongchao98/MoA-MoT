    "In quantum mechanics, when combining two angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta.\n\nThe state of the 2-electron system is given in the coupled basis as `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. Here, `l=2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m=-1` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nA measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum for the two electrons, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, will yield eigenvalues `m_1ħ` and `m_2ħ`, respectively.\nThe operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}`.\n\nSince the system is in an eigenstate of `L_z` with eigenvalue `mħ = -1ħ`, any measurement of the individual components must satisfy the condition:\n`m_1 + m_2 = m`\n`m_1 + m_2 = -1`\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L_{1z}` as `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L_{2z}` as `-ħ`. This corresponds to finding the system in a state where `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nLet's check if this outcome is possible by summing the individual `m` values:\n`m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`\n\nThis result (`-2`) contradicts the known state of the system, where the sum must be `-1`. Because the condition `m_1 + m_2 = m` is not satisfied, it is impossible to obtain these measurement outcomes simultaneously. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Clebsch-Gordan expansion, which relates the coupled state `|l, m>` to the uncoupled states `|m_1, m_2>`:\n`|l, m> = Σ_{m_1, m_2} <l_1, l_2; m_1, m_2 | l, m> |l_1, m_1> |l_2, m_2>`\n\nThe probability of measuring the specific outcome `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1` is the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n`P(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1) = |<1, 1; -1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2`\n\nA fundamental property (selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless `m = m_1 + m_2`. In this case, `m = -1` and `m_1 + m_2 = -2`. Since `m ≠ m_1 + m_2`, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0.\n\nTherefore, the probability is `|0|^2 = 0`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
