    "To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we must analyze the structure of the provided expression for the \"size estimate\":\n\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nIn quantum field theory, the calculation of a Feynman diagram with `L` loops involves integrating over `L` independent internal momenta. When performing these integrations in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral typically introduces a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the final expression.\n\nTherefore, a diagram with `L` loops will generally contain a factor of:\n\n`(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`\n\nBy examining the expression from your colleague's note, we can identify the term `1/(4π)^6`. We can equate this with the general formula to solve for `L`, the number of loops:\n\n`1/(4π)^(2L) = 1/(4π)^6`\n\nThis implies:\n\n`2L = 6`\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other components of the expression relate to different aspects of the diagram:\n*   **`alpha^3 * g^2`**: The terms `alpha` (the fine-structure constant) and `g` are coupling constants. Their powers relate to the number and type of vertices in the diagram, where interactions occur.\n*   **`(Q/M)^2`**: This is a ratio between two energy scales, `Q` and `M`, which typically arises from the evaluation of the loop integrals themselves.\n*   **`sqrt(2) * 8`**: These are numerical factors that can come from various sources, including symmetry factors of the diagram or traces over internal particle properties.\n\nThe most direct and reliable indicator of the number of loops is the power of the `1/(4π)` term, as this factor arises systematically from the integration measure of each loop. Based on this analysis, the diagram contained three loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
