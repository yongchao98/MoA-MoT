    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Synthesis of Product 4\n\n1.  **Formation of Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This set of reagents suggests an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group.\n    *   **Reactant:** Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH)\n    *   **Reaction:** Alpha-bromination\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n2.  **Formation of Product 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction.\n    *   **Reactant:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n    *   **Reaction:** Fischer Esterification\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n3.  **Formation of Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion via an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Reactant:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n    *   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic Substitution (Sₙ2)\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n4.  **Formation of Final Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a multi-step process within a single pot.\n    *   **Reactant:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n    *   **Reagents:** NaH (a strong base), Br-(CH₂)₅-Br (a dialkylating agent)\n    *   **Reaction Steps:**\n        1.  NaH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n        2.  The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n        3.  Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the α-carbon again.\n        4.  The newly formed carbanion undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentyl chain. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nThe structure consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted on a single carbon (C1) with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n```\n      EtOOC - C - CN\n           /     \\\n      (C2)H2 ----- (C6)H2\n      /             \\\n (C3)H2 ----------- (C5)H2\n      \\             /\n        --- (C4)H2 --\n```\n\n**Symmetry Analysis:**\n1.  **Conformation:** Due to the two bulky substituents on C1, the cyclohexane ring will adopt a preferred chair conformation to minimize steric strain. This means the ring is not rapidly flipping between chair forms, and therefore, axial and equatorial protons are chemically distinct.\n2.  **Plane of Symmetry:** We must check if the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry. A potential plane would pass through C1 and C4 of the ring. However, the ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is not symmetric. The bent C-O-C linkage of the ester ensures that there is no plane of symmetry in the molecule.\n3.  **Chirality:** Since the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it is chiral. In a chiral molecule, protons that cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation are chemically non-equivalent.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n\n*   **Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because the molecule is asymmetric, the chemical environment on one side of the ring (e.g., C2 and C3) is different from the environment on the other side (C6 and C5). Thus, C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n    *   This means all five methylene (CH₂) groups on the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Within each of these five distinct CH₂ groups, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are diastereotopic because of the fixed conformation and chiral nature of the molecule. They are therefore chemically distinct.\n    *   This gives 5 (non-equivalent CH₂ groups) × 2 (non-equivalent H's per group) = **10 distinct signals** from the cyclohexane ring protons.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) protons are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bond, giving **1 signal**.\n    *   The methylene group (-OCH₂-) protons are technically diastereotopic because they are part of a chiral molecule. However, in the context of such problems, unless specified otherwise, the two protons of an ethyl group's methylene are often considered chemically equivalent. They would give rise to a single, albeit potentially complex, signal. This common simplification leads to **1 signal** for the methylene protons.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl CH₂) + 1 (from the ethyl CH₃) = 12 distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, there will be 12 observable signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
