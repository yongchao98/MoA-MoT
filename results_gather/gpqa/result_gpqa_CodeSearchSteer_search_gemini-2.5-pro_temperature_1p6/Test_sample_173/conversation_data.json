    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Properties\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, `E_i = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum, `p_i = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments.\n    *   Let the rest-masses of the fragments be `m1` and `m2`, and their kinetic energies be `T1` and `T2`.\n    *   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's define `m1` as the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Rest Masses and Q-value\n\nWe can determine the rest masses of the fragments in terms of the initial mass `M`:\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which gives `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`, so `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   Then, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value of the fission) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy:\n*   `Q = E_i - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = p2`.\n*   Therefore, `2 * m1 * T1_cl = 2 * m2 * T2_cl`, which simplifies to `m1 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl`.\n*   Using `m1 = 2 * m2`, we get `(2 * m2) * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl`, so `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** We substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation: `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, calculated using the classical approximation, is 1000 MeV.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy is `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Rearranging for momentum gives: `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, `p1 = p2`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** We know `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, so `T2 = 3 - T1`. We also have the rest-mass energies `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Substitute these values into the momentum equation:\n    `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n    `396 * T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396 * T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Now, solve for T1:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600 * T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\nSo, the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 1005 MeV.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classically calculated value for T1 is:\n*   `ΔT1 = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   `ΔT1 = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
