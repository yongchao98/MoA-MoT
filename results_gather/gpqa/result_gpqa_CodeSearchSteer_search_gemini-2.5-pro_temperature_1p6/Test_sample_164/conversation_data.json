    "An analysis of the four statements reveals the following:\n\n*   **A) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.** This statement is incorrect. The essential additional step is the selective oligomerization of ethylene to form α-olefins like 1-hexene or 1-octene. Numerous highly effective catalyst systems for this reaction, particularly those based on chromium, are activated by aluminum-based compounds such as methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), or other alkylaluminum reagents. In fact, these activators are often crucial for the catalyst's function.\n\n*   **B) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.** This statement is correct. Group VIa contains chromium (Cr), which is the basis for the leading industrial catalysts for selective ethylene oligomerization. For instance, the Chevron Phillips Chemical process uses a chromium-pyrrole catalyst system for ethylene trimerization to 1-hexene, and Sasol uses chromium-phosphine systems for trimerization and tetramerization (to 1-octene). These systems are paired with specific activators, typically alkylaluminum compounds.\n\n*   **C) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.** This statement is not the best description of the technology. While some late transition metals like nickel and the noble metal palladium are researched for olefin oligomerization, the most successful and industrially dominant catalysts for the highly selective production of 1-hexene and 1-octene are chromium-based. The primary issue with noble metals is not just cost, but also that chromium systems have been proven to be exceptionally active and selective for this specific transformation.\n\n*   **D) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.** This statement is also correct. The in-situ generation of comonomers (like 1-hexene) from ethylene followed by immediate copolymerization in a single process is a known advanced industrial strategy. The first step, selective oligomerization to produce the comonomer, was industrialized by Chevron Phillips Chemical (a US-based company) with their 1-hexene process. Patents and research describe combining such oligomerization catalysts with polymerization catalysts (e.g., Ziegler-Natta or metallocene) in a single reactor system to produce linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE).\n\nBoth B and D are factually correct. However, the question asks which statement is correct regarding the *formation* of the polymer, implying the underlying chemistry. Statement B describes the specific type of catalyst (the key chemical component) that enables the crucial first step of the tandem reaction, which is a universally recognized fact in this field of catalysis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
