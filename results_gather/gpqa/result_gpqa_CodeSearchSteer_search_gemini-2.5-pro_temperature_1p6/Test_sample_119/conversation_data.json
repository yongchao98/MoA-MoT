    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, let's start with the assumption that stars are uniformly distributed in space.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Density:** If stars are distributed uniformly, it means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant. Let's call this constant density `ρ`.\n\n2.  **Volume and Distance:** The number of stars (N) within a certain distance (d) from the observer is the product of the stellar density (ρ) and the volume of a sphere with radius `d`.\n    *   Volume of a sphere: `V = (4/3) * π * d³`\n    *   Number of stars within distance `d`: `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d³`\n\n3.  **Relating Distance to Parallax:** Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d). The relationship is given by:\n    *   `d = 1 / plx`\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:** We can substitute the distance `d` in the equation for `N` with its parallax equivalent. This gives us the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx` (since smaller distances correspond to larger parallaxes).\n    *   `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3) * π * (1/plx)³`\n    *   `N(plx) = (4/3) * π * ρ * plx⁻³`\n\n5.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. This is mathematically represented by the derivative of `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`, which tells us how the number of stars changes for a small change in parallax. Let's call this quantity `n(plx)`.\n    *   `n(plx) = | dN/d(plx) |`\n    *   Taking the derivative of `N(plx)`: `dN/d(plx) = (4/3) * π * ρ * (-3 * plx⁻⁴) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴`\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as parallax increases, the total count of stars within that parallax value decreases. The density or number of stars within a specific parallax interval is the absolute value.\n    *   `n(plx) ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, for a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax varies as the inverse fourth power of the parallax. This relationship is a foundational concept in stellar statistics and is related to observational biases like the Lutz-Kelker bias.\n\n<<<A>>>"
