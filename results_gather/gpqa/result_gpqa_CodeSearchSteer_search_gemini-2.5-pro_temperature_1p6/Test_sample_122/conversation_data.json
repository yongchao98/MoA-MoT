    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically concerning time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S).\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60 000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300 000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **The concept of Time Dilation:**\n    According to the theory of special relativity, time for a moving object passes slower than for a stationary observer. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60 000 km/s / 300 000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n    `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n5.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):**\n    Now, use the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame:**\n    The distance (`d`) the ejecta travels from the perspective of the Galaxy is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d ≈ 60 000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3 061 860 km`\n\nThis calculated value of approximately 3,061,860 km is closest to option A.\n\n*   Option B (3,000,000 km) represents the classical calculation without considering relativistic time dilation (`60,000 km/s * 50 s`).\n*   Option D (2,940,000 km) is the result of incorrectly applying the Lorentz factor (dividing instead of multiplying), which would correspond to length contraction, not the distance traveled over a dilated time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
