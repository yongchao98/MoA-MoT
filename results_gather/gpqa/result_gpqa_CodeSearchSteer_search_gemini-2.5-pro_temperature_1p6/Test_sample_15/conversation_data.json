    "To determine which of the listed compounds will exhibit optical activity, each must be analyzed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture.\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a double bond and no chiral centers (a carbon atom attached to four different groups). Due to its planar nature around the double bond, it is achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:*** The name explicitly denotes a specific stereoisomer ((3aR,7aS) and (E)). Naming a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule means it is optically active. This complex structure is chiral, and a single enantiomer like this one will rotate plane-polarized light.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:*** This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a meso compound. Meso compounds have a plane of symmetry, making them achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:*** This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:*** The \"(R)\" designation indicates that this is a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is attached is a chiral center. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:*** In this molecule, all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\n7.  ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:*** An analysis of this molecule's structure reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The molecule as a whole is achiral and, consequently, not optically active.\n\nIn summary, three of the compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, the correct count of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
