    "This problem can be solved by applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms in different energy levels when a system is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the excited state and a lower energy state, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of these energy levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's define the ratio of the number of atoms in the specific excited energy level to a reference lower level for each star. Let this ratio be R.\n\nFor star 1 (temperature T₁):\nR₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\nFor star 2 (temperature T₂):\nR₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This means R₁ = 2 * R₂.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for R₁ and R₂:\n(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) is a constant for the specific atomic transition and can be canceled from both sides:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\nln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2):\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\nTo combine the terms in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator (T₁ * T₂):\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThe problem provides that the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is also 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting this value into our equation:\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\nln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
