    "### Analysis of the Observations\n\nThe experimental evidence points strongly towards the presence of two distinct but closely related chemical species in the crude peptide sample. Let's break down the data:\n\n*   **¹H NMR Data:** The observation of two peaks for a single alpha-proton, which together integrate to the expected value of one proton, indicates the presence of two different environments for that proton. Since these peaks have similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, it suggests two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio and are structurally very similar. Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out.\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates components of a mixture based on their physical properties. The presence of two peaks demonstrates that there are two separable species in the sample. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data shows that both separated species have the same mass, which is consistent with the target molecule. This rules out impurities like precursors or products of side reactions that would alter the mass (like the \"double coupling\" mentioned in option D).\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect. A precursor would have a different molecular weight, which would be detected by the mass spectrometer. The MS data shows both peaks have the same, expected mass.\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is the most plausible explanation. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass, but different three-dimensional arrangements. Because of these structural differences, they have distinct physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **In NMR:** The different spatial arrangement means that corresponding protons (like the alpha-proton in question) exist in slightly different electronic environments, resulting in separate peaks in the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **In LC:** Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, resulting in two peaks.\n    *   There are two common ways diastereomers could have formed in this context:\n        1.  **Epimerization:** During chemical peptide synthesis, the chiral center of an amino acid (the alpha-carbon) can sometimes invert, changing its stereochemistry from L to D (or vice-versa). If one amino acid in the peptide chain epimerizes, the resulting molecule is a diastereomer of the intended peptide.\n        2.  **Atropisomerism:** Peptides can exhibit a form of diastereomerism called atropisomerism, which arises from hindered rotation around a bond, most commonly the amide bond (C-N bond). This restricted rotation can create stable, separable conformers (often called rotamers) that behave as distinct diastereomers. This is particularly common for peptide bonds involving proline or other N-alkylated amino acids. These conformers would be separable by LC and would show distinct NMR signals. The use of elevated temperature in the LC-MS is a hint that could relate to the stability and interconversion rate of such isomers.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would not be separated by a standard LC column and would produce a single peak. Likewise, they would have identical NMR spectra in a standard solvent, yielding only one set of peaks.\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is incorrect. \"Double coupling\" would mean an extra amino acid was added to the peptide, resulting in a molecule with a significantly higher mass. This contradicts the MS data, which shows the expected mass for both peaks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined NMR and LC-MS data—specifically, two separable species of the same mass that show distinct NMR signals for the same proton—is classic evidence for a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
