    "To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the principles of conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle as it applies to the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### Summary of a Permitted Transition's Conditions\n\n1.  **Initial State (`1S0`):**\n    *   The term symbol `1S0` describes a state with total spin `S_i = 0`, total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`, and total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:**\n    *   The total parity must be conserved in the reaction.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P_f = (-1)^L_f`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P(X) = -1`), and the parity from the relative orbital motion of X (`P_orb = (-1)^l_X`).\n    *   The conservation law is `P_i = P_f * P(X) * P_orb`, which means `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1) = +1`, which requires the sum `L_f + l_X` to be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved (`J_i = J_f + J_X`, vector sum).\n    *   Since the initial angular momentum is `J_i = 0`, the final total angular momentum must also be zero. This requires the total angular momentum of the final NN state (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`J_X`) to be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`J_f = J_X`).\n    *   Assuming particle X is a spin-0 particle (a common assumption for emitted pseudoscalar mesons like pions), its total angular momentum is simply its orbital angular momentum, `J_X = l_X`.\n    *   Therefore, the condition for angular momentum conservation becomes `J_f = l_X`.\n\n4.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    *   The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the Pauli statistics impose the condition `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\nWe will test each proposed transition against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any one of them.\n\n| Option | Final NN State `(2S+1)L(J)` | `S_f` | `L_f` | `J_f` | `l_X` | Rule 1: `S_f + L_f` is odd? | Rule 2: `J_f = l_X`? | Rule 3: `L_f + l_X` is odd? | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **A)** | `3P0` | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | `1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **Violated.** | `0 = 0` (Yes) | `1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). Yes. | **No** |\n| **B)** | `7D1` | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | `3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). Yes. | `1 = 1` (Yes) | `2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). Yes. | Yes |\n| **C)** | `3S1` | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | `1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). Yes. | `1 = 1` (Yes) | `0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). Yes. | Yes |\n| **D)** | `3D3` | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | `1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). Yes. | `3 = 3` (Yes) | `2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). Yes. | Yes |\n\n*Note on option B)*: A `7D1` state implies a total spin `S=3`, which is not possible for a two-nucleon system (where S can only be 0 or 1). However, even if such a state were considered hypothetically, the transition still obeys all the given selection rules. The question asks which wave is not permitted by the given rules, not which final state is physically possible.\n\nBased on the analysis, the transition **A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s** is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics requirement for the final two-nucleon state (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\n<<<A>>>"
