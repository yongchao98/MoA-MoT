    "Here is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the alpha-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons to the carbonyl group: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with both an ethyl and a methyl group, meaning it has no protons to be removed.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only deprotonate the ketone at the C6 position, forming a single, specific enolate.\n*   **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate formed at C6 will attack the electron-deficient β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n*   **Product A:** After protonation during workup, the substituent added to the C6 position of the ring is a `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt` group (an ethyl propanoate group). A search result confirms that the resulting product is named ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. In this IUPAC name, the propanoate is the parent chain, and the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent attached at its C1 position (which was the C6 position in the starting material).\n\n**Therefore, Product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.**\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction (specifically, a nitro-Michael addition). The base (KOH) deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon (the carbon bearing the nitro group), forming a nitronate anion. This anion then attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n*   **Nitronate Formation:** KOH removes a proton from the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**NO₂), creating the nucleophilic nitronate anion (CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂).\n*   **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-**CH**=CH-CN). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the original nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n*   **Product B:** After the reaction and protonation, the final structure is formed.\n    *   The original but-2-enenitrile chain was: C(4)H₃-C(3)H=C(2)H-C(1)N. The attack occurs at C3.\n    *   The original 1-nitropropane was: NO₂-C(1')H₂-C(2')H₂-C(3')H₃. The attack occurs from C1'.\n    *   The new molecule has the C1' of nitropropane attached to the C3 of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This gives the structure: NO₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n*   **Nomenclature:** To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN). That chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    1.  C1 is the carbon of the nitrile group (-**C**N).\n    2.  C2 is -CH₂-.\n    3.  C3 is -CH(CH₃)-. It has a methyl group.\n    4.  C4 is -CH(NO₂)-. It has a nitro group and an ethyl group attached to it from the original 1-nitropropane. Let's re-examine the connectivity. The alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂**CH**NO₂) attacks the beta-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (CH₃**CH**=CHCN). So the product structure is `NC-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(NO2)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile (CN) as C1, the main chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   At C3, there is a methyl group.\n    *   At C4, there is a nitro group.\n*   A search result confirms the product of this type of reaction.\n\n**Therefore, Product B is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nMatching these products with the given options leads to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
