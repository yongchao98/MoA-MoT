    "The reaction in question is the self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene using Grubbs catalyst. Olefin metathesis involves the redistribution of carbon-carbon double bonds. Since the starting material is a terminal alkene, the reaction will produce a new internal alkene and ethene, which is excluded from the product count.\n\nThe starting material, 3-methylpent-1-ene, is chiral at the C3 position. Because it is a racemic mixture, it contains equal amounts of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nThe self-metathesis reaction can occur between three possible pairings of these enantiomers:\n1.  **Two molecules of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene react:** This reaction (S + S) forms (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The newly formed double bond at the C4 position can have either an (E) or a (Z) configuration. This results in two distinct products which are diastereomers of each other.\n2.  **Two molecules of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene react:** This reaction (R + R) forms (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Similarly, this product can exist as (E) and (Z) isomers. These two products are the enantiomers of the products from the S+S reaction.\n3.  **One molecule of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene reacts with one molecule of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene:** This cross-reaction (R + S) produces (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This molecule has stereocenters with opposite configurations and is a meso compound. Like the other products, it will form both (E) and (Z) isomers at the new double bond. These two meso products are diastereomers of all the other products.\n\nIn total, combining these possibilities gives:\n*   (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n*   (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n*   (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n*   (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n*   (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n*   (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n\nThis gives a total of 6 possible, structurally distinct stereoisomeric products, excluding ethene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
