    "Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a phenomenon where the underlying laws of a system possess a certain symmetry, but the system's ground state (lowest energy state) does not. According to Goldstone's theorem, when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, massless particles known as Goldstone bosons (or Nambu-Goldstone bosons) must appear.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each particle in relation to spontaneously broken symmetries:\n*   **A) Magnon**: A magnon is the quasiparticle form of a spin wave. In ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials, the alignment of atomic spins in the ground state breaks the continuous rotational symmetry of the system. Magnons are the Goldstone bosons that arise from this broken symmetry.\n\n*   **B) Phonon**: A phonon is a quantum of vibrational energy in a crystal lattice. The regular, repeating structure of a crystal breaks the continuous translational symmetry of free space. Phonons are considered the Goldstone bosons resulting from this spontaneously broken translational symmetry.\n\n*   **D) Pion**: In the theory of strong interactions (quantum chromodynamics), the Lagrangian has an approximate global chiral symmetry. This symmetry is spontaneously broken, giving rise to nearly massless particles called pseudo-Goldstone bosons. The pions are these pseudo-Goldstone bosons.\n\n*   **C) Skyrmion**: A skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson. Instead, it is a topologically stable, particle-like configuration of a field. While skyrmions often arise in systems where symmetries are spontaneously broken (such as in models of pions or in certain magnetic materials), they are topological solitons, not the direct massless particle consequence of the symmetry breaking described by Goldstone's theorem. Their stability comes from their topological properties, which means they cannot be undone by smooth deformations.\n\nTherefore, the magnon, phonon, and pion are all directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries as Goldstone or pseudo-Goldstone bosons. The skyrmion, being a topological soliton, is the exception.\n\n<<<C>>>"
