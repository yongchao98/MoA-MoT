    "To definitively determine the correct pair of compounds, it is crucial to analyze the 1H NMR spectral data for each potential molecule. The mixture is described as having two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent. This results in one sharp singlet for the 12 methyl protons (around 2.18 ppm) and one singlet for the two aromatic protons (around 6.89 ppm).\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two aromatic protons equivalent, leading to one aromatic singlet. It also makes the methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 equivalent. This results in one aromatic singlet (for 2H at ~6.88 ppm) and two distinct alkyl singlets (for 6H each at ~2.24 ppm and ~2.17 ppm).\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule lacks the symmetry of the other two isomers. The two aromatic protons have different chemical environments and therefore appear as two separate singlets. The four methyl groups are also in unique positions, giving rise to three separate signals (with one signal representing two equivalent methyl groups).\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As a control, this molecule shows a single peak for its four equivalent aromatic protons. Its alkyl region is characterized by a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, which rules it out as a candidate.\n\n**Evaluating the Options for the Mixture:**\n\nThe observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows a total of two aromatic singlets and three alkyl singlets. Let's see which pair matches this observation.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene by itself already produces two aromatic singlets. When mixed with 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (which adds a third), the total number of aromatic signals would be three, which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H). This gives a total of two aromatic singlets. Since both compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio and each signal represents two protons, the signal integrals will have a 1:1 ratio. This matches the problem description perfectly.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (6H each). This results in a total of three alkyl singlets. The proton ratio for these signals is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would result in three aromatic singlets (one from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two from 1,2,3,5-TMB), which is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not show singlets in the alkyl region, and the number of aromatic signals would be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only combination that matches all the spectral data is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
