    "The problem describes the annihilation of a slowly moving antiproton with a proton, which is assumed to be at rest. The process results in the creation of four new particles. This is a classic physics problem involving the conversion of mass into energy, governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Determine the Initial Energy:** The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is considered negligible, and we can assume both particles are effectively at rest. The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of their rest mass energies. The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The widely accepted value for the rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n    *   $E_p = m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $E_{\\bar{p}} = m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $E_i = E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n2.  **Determine the Initial Momentum:** Since both particles are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Due to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Energy:** The final state consists of two particles of type $A^+$ and two of type $A^-$, for a total of four particles. All these particles have the same mass, with a rest energy given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$. When these particles are created, they will be moving, so their total energy includes both their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. The total energy of one such particle is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$. Since there are four identical particles, the total final energy ($E_f$) is:\n    *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV})$\n    *   $1876.54 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n5.  **Solve for Velocity:** Now, we can solve for $\\gamma$ and then for the velocity $v$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Using the definition of the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$, we can solve for $v$:\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    *   $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light (c). Comparing this result with the given options:\n    *   A) 0.91c\n    *   B) 0.96c\n    *   C) 0.86c\n    *   D) 0.77c\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
